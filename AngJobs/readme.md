The code. Setup for devs
==
The single page app is based on [ng.Net.Template](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/48d928e3-9b5c-4faf-b46f-d6baa7d9886c) by Dahln Farnes 

On server side it uses .NET C# to provide the JSON endpoints(~/api/...) and Entity Framework Code First apropach for the data layer.
The single page app code(javascript+css) is located in ~/Assets/app

To run the web app on Windows you need [Visual Studio]( https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)
and [Sql Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/sql-server-express.aspx) both are free tools by Microsoft 

*update*: this is the code style I might want to follow https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#table-of-contents

Run tests
==
To run unit tests use this command at your command prompt:

AngJobs\AngJobs>**karma start test/karma.conf.js**
