Our 2024 goal is to replace Node.js as the default server-side JavaScript runtime. We launched Bun 1.0 back in September: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsnCpESUEqM" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsnCpESUEqM</a>, and it&#39;s been a really exciting 6-ish months seeing developers use Bun at companies like X (Twitter), Midjourney and Brex.</p><p>Today we have over 2,000 issues open in our GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues">https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues</a>, and while we love seeing people use Bun, it&#39;s clear that we need to grow the team to help make Bun more reliable and implement missing features blocking companies from switching to Bun.</p><p>We are hiring systems engineers in San Francisco to help make Bun more reliable and implement new runtime APIs and services. Bun is written in a mix of Zig and C++, but experience with Zig is not required (People with a C/C++ background tend to pick up Zig quickly). Working on Bun often involves reading WebKit/JavaScriptCore source code, Zig standard library source code, Darwin XNU source code, and sometimes Linux kernel source code. We are a well-funded early-stage startup (9 people currently). Our office is in the financial district in San Francisco</p><p>Please apply here: <a href="https://apply.workable.com/oven/j/A7A1388873/" rel="nofollow">https://apply.workable.com/oven/j/A7A1388873/</a></p>',5),o=[i];function s(c,u){return n(),t("div",null,o)}const m=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","Jarred-Bun(YCS19)-SanFrancisco-ONSITE-Full-time.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/February-2024/Jarred-Bun(YCS19)-SanFrancisco-ONSITE-Full-time.html","title":"Bun (YC S19) : San Francisco","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Bun (YC S19) : San Francisco","author":{"name":"Jarred","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39224489"},"description":"Bun (YC S19) - https://bun.sh - San Francisco - ONSITE - Full-time Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner, and bundler.
