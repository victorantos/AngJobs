Mostly generalist programmers with at least 1 strong specialty over the past few years. We believe that great software need a decent mix of generalists and specialists to cover the whole spectrum of programming practices.</p></li><li><p>We all work very closely to product and design and put a lot of emphasis on having the user at the center of all our technical reflections â€” pushing the boundaries of what could be (more) awesome for the end user.</p></li><li><p>We make the extra effort of defining, dividing and sizing technical projects and use Linear to communicate those with the rest of the team as well as tracking progress within the team. We value rigor, pragmatism and performance in all our technical decisions.</p></li><li><p>Having a team of seasoned programmers greatly helps in that regard. Since we are working on a single monorepo, we encourage one another to cross language boundaries when it feels right. We believe that exposure to different environments makes you a better programmer.</p></li></ul>',4),i=[r];function s(m,l){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const h=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","kristiedleson-StaffiOSEngineer(andmanyotherengroles)_amo-Paris(Onsite).html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/March-2024/kristiedleson-StaffiOSEngineer(andmanyotherengroles)_amo-Paris(Onsite).html","title":"Staff iOS Engineer (and many other eng roles)  amo : Paris (Onsite)","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Staff iOS Engineer (and many other eng roles)  amo : Paris (Onsite)","author":{"name":"kristiedleson","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39563479"},"description":"Staff iOS Engineer (and many other eng roles) amo - https://amo.co/about/ - Paris (Onsite) - Relocation & Visa sponsorship https://amo.co/jobs/?ashby_jid=f185606c-55b3-4d32-8145...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/March-2024/kristiedleson-StaffiOSEngineer(andmanyotherengroles)_amo-Paris(Onsite).html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Staff iOS Engineer (and many other eng roles)  amo : Paris (Onsite)"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Staff iOS Engineer (and many other eng roles) amo - https://amo.co/about/ - Paris (Onsite) - Relocation & Visa sponsorship https://amo.co/jobs/?ashby_jid=f185606c-55b3-4d32-8145..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"kristiedleson"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Staff iOS Engineer (and many other eng roles)  amo : Paris (Onsite)\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"kristiedleson\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39563479\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":3}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.85,"words":256},"filePathRelative":"hn/March-2024/kristiedleson-StaffiOSEngineer(andmanyotherengroles)\\namo-Paris(Onsite).md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{h as comp,d as data};
