Our mission at Ryzyliant is to provide a unified and streamlined tool that is designed to facilitate the end to end workflow of the dispatch operator, speeding dispatch operations and reducing errors.</p><p>We are using leading edge local-first browser applications to provide the benefits of the cloud with the stand-alone survivability of traditional on-premise solutions.</p><p>We are seeking one or more Senior Developers who have some or all of the following skills:</p><pre><code>  - Advanced TypeScript
