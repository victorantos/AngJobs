Through a combination of in-house engineering projects, targeted investments, generous grants, and multi-media public education efforts, we will free technology from the control of the few and recreate the spirit of freedom, innovation, and self-reliance that underpinned the American tech industry only a few decades ago. Our principles are here: <a href="https://futo.org/what-is-futo" rel="nofollow">https://futo.org/what-is-futo</a></p><p>FUBS is our self-hosted programming system (including it&#39;s own programming language) that practices radical incompatibility with the existing software stack: <a href="https://gitlab.futo.org/eron/public/-/wikis/FUBS" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.futo.org/eron/public/-/wikis/FUBS</a> We are hiring a software engineer to help us develop an overlay network: <a href="https://futo.org/jobs/software-engineer-networking" rel="nofollow">https://futo.org/jobs/software-engineer-networking</a> and have a general opportunity post for highly independent engineers: <a href="https://futo.org/jobs/senior-software-engineer-general-opportunity" rel="nofollow">https://futo.org/jobs/senior-software-engineer-general-oppor...</a></p><p>FUTO is also hiring for hourly engineering roles on the revolutionary cross-platform video streaming app Grayjay <a href="https://grayjay.app/" rel="nofollow">https://grayjay.app/</a></p><p>Recommendation Engine Developer - Grayjay aims to introduce a feature that recommends creators/videos to users based on their interests. The initial task involves developing an algorithm to tag channels in a way that correlates them with similar channels. <a href="https://futo.org/jobs/recommendation-engine-developer-grayjay" rel="nofollow">https://futo.org/jobs/recommendation-engine-developer-grayja...</a></p><p>FCast Developer - We seek to create an open source casting protocol for wide adoption. Some work has already been done (see <a href="https://fcast.org/" rel="nofollow">https://fcast.org/</a>). You can help bring FCast to a wide developer audience by making libraries for multiple languages and are interested in bringing FCast to new platforms (Roku, AppleTV, TizenOS, WebOS, â€¦). <a href="https://futo.org/jobs/fcast-developer-grayjay" rel="nofollow">https://futo.org/jobs/fcast-developer-grayjay</a></p><p>To apply, send your resume and cover letter to jobs at futo dot org with the subject of the position you&#39;re interested in.</p>',7),i=[r];function s(l,p){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const g=e(a,[["render",s],["__file","ReadEvalPost-FUTO-Austin_TX.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/jobs/June-2024/ReadEvalPost-FUTO-Austin_TX.html","title":"FUTO : Austin, TX","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"FUTO : Austin, TX","author":{"name":"ReadEvalPost","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40563939"},"description":"FUTO - Austin, TX - On-site / Hybrid / Remote - Full Time / Hourly FUTO is an organization dedicated to developing, both through in-house engineering and investment, technologie...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/jobs/June-2024/ReadEvalPost-FUTO-Austin_TX.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"FUTO : Austin, TX"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"FUTO - Austin, TX - On-site / Hybrid / Remote - Full Time / Hourly FUTO is an organization dedicated to developing, both through in-house engineering and investment, technologie..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ReadEvalPost"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"FUTO : Austin, TX\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ReadEvalPost\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40563939\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719852904000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.55,"words":466},"filePathRelative":"jobs/June-2024/ReadEvalPost-FUTO-Austin_TX.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{g as comp,h as data};
