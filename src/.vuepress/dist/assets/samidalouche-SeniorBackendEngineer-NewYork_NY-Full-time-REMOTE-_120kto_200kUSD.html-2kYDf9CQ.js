The same building blocks that power the marketplace enable other data collaboration use cases, like clean room data analysis and the automatic segmentation and delivery of data to other platforms. We&#39;re also building towards a future where users can leverage our collaboration tools without needing to push their data to us, instead our query engine will be embeddable where their data is already at rest.</p><p>We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. While the company&#39;s headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu√©bec), and Poland.</p><p>In brief, the technologies we use are:</p><ul><li><p>Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Calcite in the backend. We love functional programming and make use of libraries like Cats, Cats-Effect, and FS2, but we keep a pragmatic stance on purity given our exposure to the Spark ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Our services are deployed on AWS and provisioned using Terraform. We leverage the usual suspects: Fargate, EMR, RDS, Lambda, etc. and we&#39;re starting to lean into Kubernetes. Being a small team, we think twice before rolling out custom infrastructure that we&#39;ll need to monitor and maintain.</p></li><li><p>On the frontend, we use Typescript, VueJS, PrimeVue, Nuxt, and Vite.</p></li></ul><p>Job postings and more on information about our team and culture are available at: <a href="https://jobs.narrative.io/" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.narrative.io/</a></p><p>Apply by sending your resume to hiring-dev@narrative.io.</p>',8),o=[r];function s(l,c){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const m=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","samidalouche-SeniorBackendEngineer-NewYork_NY-Full-time-REMOTE-_120kto_200kUSD.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/March-2024/samidalouche-SeniorBackendEngineer-NewYork_NY-Full-time-REMOTE-_120kto_200kUSD.html","title":"Senior Backend Engineer : New York, NY","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Senior Backend Engineer : New York, NY","author":{"name":"samidalouche","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39564320"},"description":"Narrative I/O - Senior Backend Engineer - New York, NY - Full-time - REMOTE - $120k to $200k USD - https://narrative.io/ Since being founded in 2016, Narrative has been building...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/March-2024/samidalouche-SeniorBackendEngineer-NewYork_NY-Full-time-REMOTE-_120kto_200kUSD.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Senior Backend Engineer : New York, NY"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Narrative I/O - Senior Backend Engineer - New York, NY - Full-time - REMOTE - $120k to $200k USD - https://narrative.io/ Since being founded in 2016, Narrative has been building..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"samidalouche"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Senior Backend Engineer : New York, NY\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"samidalouche\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39564320\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.35,"words":405},"filePathRelative":"hn/March-2024/samidalouche-SeniorBackendEngineer-NewYork_NY-Full-time-REMOTE-$120kto$200kUSD.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{m as comp,u as data};
