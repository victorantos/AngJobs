We’re leveraging machine learning to bridge the gap between process (how materials are made) and performance (how materials behave). For example, using our image-based generative AI technology, we designed a Li-ion battery cathode with a 10% increased power density compared to the original design.</p><p>We’re building a SaaS platform that enables materials designers to use state-of-the-art AI techniques in their day-to-day work. We’ve just closed our first round of Angel/VC funding, and have just been announced as a finalist of the UK Government’s Manchester Prize [2].</p><p>We’re a small team with deep expertise in materials science and AI. We’re looking for software engineers excited about building early-stage tech products to join us in productising our world-leading research [3].</p><p>Some of the things on our roadmap you’ll work on include:</p><ul><li>Building a robust cloud platform for scheduling the training and serving of bespoke AI models for our customers.</li><li>A rich web-based image manipulation application for pre-processing image data that is used to train ML models.</li></ul><p>Tech Stack: TypeScript (React / Next.js /Express / Prisma), Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.</p><p>Apply via our jobs page: <a href="https://apply.workable.com/polaron" rel="nofollow">https://apply.workable.com/polaron</a>.</p><p>If you’d like any more information, please reach out at: careers@polaron.ai.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/250657/ai-spinout-polaron-accelerate-design-advanced/" rel="nofollow">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/250657/ai-spinout-polaron-ac...</a> [2]: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-ai-pioneers-share-1-million-in-prizes-as-government-unveils-inaugural-manchester-prize-finalists" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-ai-pioneers-share...</a> [3]: <a href="https://polaron.ai" rel="nofollow">https://polaron.ai</a></p>',10),i=[a];function l(s,p){return n(),o("div",null,i)}const g=e(t,[["render",l],["__file","chrislomaxjones-Polaron-SoftwareEngineer_SeniorSoftwareEngineer-London_UK-Full-time.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/June-2024/chrislomaxjones-Polaron-SoftwareEngineer_SeniorSoftwareEngineer-London_UK-Full-time.html","title":"Polaron : Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Polaron : Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer","author":{"name":"chrislomaxjones","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40563350"},"description":"Polaron - Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer - London, UK - Full-time Polaron is an Imperial College London spinout [1] using generative AI to transform the material de...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/June-2024/chrislomaxjones-Polaron-SoftwareEngineer_SeniorSoftwareEngineer-London_UK-Full-time.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Polaron : Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Polaron - Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer - London, UK - Full-time Polaron is an Imperial College London spinout [1] using generative AI to transform the material de..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"chrislomaxjones"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Polaron : Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"chrislomaxjones\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40563350\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1718921316000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":3}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.24,"words":371},"filePathRelative":"hn/June-2024/chrislomaxjones-Polaron-SoftwareEngineer_SeniorSoftwareEngineer-London_UK-Full-time.md","localizedDate":"June 21, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{g as comp,d as data};
