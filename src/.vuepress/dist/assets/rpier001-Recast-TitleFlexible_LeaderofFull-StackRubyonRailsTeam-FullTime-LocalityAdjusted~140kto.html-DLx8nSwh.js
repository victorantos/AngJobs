That means that we help our customers determine how to spend more than $1.2 billion of their marketing budget more effectively. We’re a small (&lt; 50 person) startup with a good mix of paying customers, a considerable runway, and a clear viable path to profitability.</p><p>I’m the VP of Engineering at Recast. I hold that hiring in tech is horrible, I’m aiming to have as humane as possible application experience. You’ll be meeting with engineers from your first live interview up until the pre-offer stage… and I promise to be real with you every step of the way.</p><p>I&#39;ve taken a fairly unusual path into technical leadership and had most of my IC experience in Data Science and DevOps. You must be someone who has experiences that complement my own to join me as the second explicit leader in our ten person Engineering organization. You should be poised to grow with the company into being a senior engineering leader with a broad scope of responsibilities. On an immediate basis, you’ll take responsibility for a three person Ruby-on-Rails team and engage across the full spectrum of technical and people leadership. That includes direct communication and coordination with our product and executive team to maximize the value we deliver to our customers, driving high quality solutions, code review, one-on-ones, and hands-on development work. You will be contributing your expertise in software development and architecture to guide our core full stack application and future tech decisions.</p><p>Some bits of our tech stack: Ruby-on-Rails, React, Tailwind UI, Hotwire, Turbo, Heroku, PostgresSQL, Sidekiq, Docker, k8s, TypeScript</p><p>Other Benefits: Mature remote culture with limited meetings; work with incredibly educated and smart folk (Recast has the most PhDs per capita I’ve ever seen)</p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/recastlabs/" rel="nofollow">https://www.linkedin.com/company/recastlabs/</a> Glassdoor: <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Recast-EI_IE8459974.11,17.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Recast-EI_IE84...</a> nothing there, but there are some less good companies that share our name and I don’t want folks to be confused.</p><p>Questions, Want to stand out? Email russell@getrecast.com with the subject line HN? for the former or HN! For the latter. For HN?, If I can’t answer you quickly or completely, a likely outcome is that I’ll schedule a short meeting between us so that we can quickly address mutual fit. For HN!, attach your resume also, at the very least I can promise you some very brief feedback about why/why not you’re getting a Calendly link in my response. Regardless, if applying, also use the application link below.</p><p>I’ll be out of office this week but will start responding to requests next week.</p><p>Application Link: <a href="https://grnh.se/f9a2b8498us" rel="nofollow">https://grnh.se/f9a2b8498us</a></p>',10),r=[l];function n(s,c){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const p=e(i,[["render",n],["__file","rpier001-Recast-TitleFlexible_LeaderofFull-StackRubyonRailsTeam-FullTime-LocalityAdjusted~140kto.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/June-2024/rpier001-Recast-TitleFlexible_LeaderofFull-StackRubyonRailsTeam-FullTime-LocalityAdjusted~140kto.html","title":"Recast : Title Flexible, Leader of Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Team","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Recast : Title Flexible, Leader of Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Team","author":{"name":"rpier001","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40563330"},"description":"Recast - https://getrecast.com - Title Flexible, Leader of Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Team - REMOTE/Global - Full Time - Locality Adjusted ~140k to 210k + equity At Recast we’re c...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/June-2024/rpier001-Recast-TitleFlexible_LeaderofFull-StackRubyonRailsTeam-FullTime-LocalityAdjusted~140kto.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Recast : Title Flexible, Leader of Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Team"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Recast - https://getrecast.com - Title Flexible, Leader of Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Team - REMOTE/Global - Full Time - Locality Adjusted ~140k to 210k + equity At Recast we’re c..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"rpier001"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Recast : Title Flexible, Leader of Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Team\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"rpier001\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40563330\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.92,"words":575},"filePathRelative":"hn/June-2024/rpier001-Recast-TitleFlexible_LeaderofFull-StackRubyonRailsTeam-FullTime-LocalityAdjusted~140kto.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{p as comp,d as data};
