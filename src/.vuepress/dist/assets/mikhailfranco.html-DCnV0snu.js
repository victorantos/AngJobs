  - remote in region
  - remote by exact timezone
  - remote by timezone range (or official office hours)
  - mostly remote, with some country qualification
  - really, truly, totally remote
</code></pre><p><em>In country,</em> is because the company wants just one legal jurisdiction for employment, perhaps also for some filter on criminality/identity/banking.</p><p><em>In region</em> is not really defined in the world, except EU has some common employment law, corporate/banking harmonization, and small timezone spread.</p><p>Countries are not necessarily temporally <em>compact</em> in the sense of only 1 timezone. Obviously Russia, Canada, US... are extreme examples. Chile is well-behaved. But some places are split on daylight savings, so that is not strictly included in the criterion, there is just +-1hr in summer/winter.</p><p><em>Exact timezone</em> might allow various N-S combinations, such as London-Lisbon.</p><p><em>Timezone range</em> might allow London-Cape Town, or any US and Mexico. It&#39;s really overlapping office hours for core meeting schedule, independent of country.</p><p><em>Mostly remote</em> might have some global freedom, but be limited to where the company has a legal entity for employment - or the opposite for contractors. Note that these may conflict: so you may not hire an &#39;offshore&#39; contractor in a country where you have a legal presence (e.g. US company hires contractor through a Singapore company, but the contractor actually lives in Myanmar, which may be on the blacklist - see below, yes it is - or say India, where the original hiring company has a legal presence).</p><p><em>Totally remote</em> does not exist. There are legal and financial sanctions that exist from West-G7-G20-OECD against various other countries that are beyond-the-pale. The core subset of rejects are the obvious axis-of-evilly kinda places, but there are many excluded by a corrupt banking system, or cyberattack risk (assuming you ship laptop or have connectivity through local country ISP - surely not, that&#39;s what VPNs are for, but try asking to live in China ðŸ˜ƒ For example, N. Korea is obviously off-the-table, so is Vietnam, okay nice cheap place to live but I understand, however the Philippines as well (really?) yes, I assume mafia/banking or something.</p>`,10),r=[i];function s(c,m){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const p=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","mikhailfranco.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/jobs/March-2024/mikhailfranco.html","title":"mikhailfranco","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"mikhailfranco","author":{"name":"mikhailfranco","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39573789"},"description":"Procedural question: The REMOTE thing is not specific enough.
