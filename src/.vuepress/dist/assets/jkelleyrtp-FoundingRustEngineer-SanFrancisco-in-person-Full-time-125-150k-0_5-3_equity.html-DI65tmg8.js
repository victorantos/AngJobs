Dioxus is a popular crossplatform GUI library for Rust that, imo, is the easiest way to ship apps that are beautiful, fast, and robust.</p><p>Dioxus is quite popular, almost 20k stars on GitHub, and we recently raised a sizable seed round from &quot;top vcs.&quot; We have a lot of exciting projects on the horizon:</p><ul><li><p>in-place binary patching for rust hotreloading (<a href="http://github.com/jkelleyrtp/ipbp">http://github.com/jkelleyrtp/ipbp</a>)</p></li><li><p>a WGPU powered HTML/CSS renderer (<a href="http://github.com/dioxusLabs/blitz">http://github.com/dioxusLabs/blitz</a>)</p></li><li><p>experiments with LLM-based component generation (<a href="http://github.com/dioxusLabs/dioxus-ai">http://github.com/dioxusLabs/dioxus-ai</a>)</p></li><li><p>upcoming mobile tooling</p></li><li><p>TUI-based devtools for a ruby-on-rail like experience</p></li><li><p>a deploy platform for web/desktop/mobile/backend and all the fun that entails...</p></li></ul><p>I&#39;m looking for a founding systems engineer passionate about Rust, WASM, apps, the web, compilers, linkers, and devex - basically someone who&#39;s not afraid of anything.
