We keep teams using cloud services productively while compliant and risk-aligned. From cloud computing providers like AWS, GCP and Azure to hosted apps like GitHub and PagerDuty, Trustle understands the management of user permissions for a rapidly growing portfolio of cloud hosted software solutions and identifies things that require attention to any teams that manage access in an organization.</p><p>Granting, revoking and configuring access should not be a maze of clicking thru admin consoles, Terraform, custom tools and scripts. What we’re building will empower our customers to spend time in their core competencies with access to systems as an afterthought.</p><p>We are a small, fully remote, well-funded company with dozens of cloud services already supported for our customers with an experienced team with alumni/alumna from Okta, Netflix, AWS, Cruise and GitHub.
