We learn how your team works, identify ‚Äúwinning‚Äù strategies/behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!</li></ul><p>We‚Äôre working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms &amp; infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You&#39;ll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)</p><p>Right now we‚Äôre a small team (~15 engineers) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $5M ARR!</p><p>Looking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers.
