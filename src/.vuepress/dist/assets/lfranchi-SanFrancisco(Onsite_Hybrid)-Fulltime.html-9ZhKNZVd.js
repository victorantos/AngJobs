We do this at a fraction of the cost a large company would pay for this, by delivering these capabilities through powerful software.</p><p>We care about building a thoughtful, high-trust culture that values ownership and shipping. We’re looking to hire teammates from different backgrounds and experiences and are hiring for a number of engineering roles:</p><ul><li>Software Engineer, Product (2-5yrs experience)</li><li>Senior Software Engineer, Product (5+ years experience)</li><li>Senior Software Engineer, Infrastructure (</li></ul><p>All of our teams have unique charters to collectively build the software, services and systems that enable Pilot to deliver a high-quality experience, profitably, at scale. From the Banking Universe — teams that ingest, normalize, transform, and categorize customer financial data to the Business Universe — teams that ingest our customer revenue and expense information and produce accurate, automated accounting, you’ll work with a empathetic team that builds software that humans use and businesses rely on.</p><p>Pilot’s backend is written in fully typed Python 3.11, and our frontend is JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js. We use Terraform to manage our production infrastructure, and deploy Docker containers to ECS. AWS CodeDeploy powers our deployments and we rely on Honeycomb for our monitoring and Postgres as our database.</p><p><a href="https://pilot.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https://pilot.com/jobs</a> or email me leo@pilot.com</p>',7),a=[n];function s(c,l){return o(),t("div",null,a)}const m=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","lfranchi-SanFrancisco(Onsite_Hybrid)-Fulltime.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/April-2024/lfranchi-SanFrancisco(Onsite_Hybrid)-Fulltime.html","title":"San Francisco (Onsite, Hybrid) : Full time","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"San Francisco (Onsite, Hybrid) : Full time","author":{"name":"lfranchi","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39900983"},"description":"Pilot (https://pilot.com) - San Francisco (Onsite, Hybrid) - Full time Pilot runs your business’s financial back office so you don’t have to: our aim is to provide our customers...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/April-2024/lfranchi-SanFrancisco(Onsite_Hybrid)-Fulltime.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"San Francisco (Onsite, Hybrid) : Full time"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Pilot (https://pilot.com) - San Francisco (Onsite, Hybrid) - Full time Pilot runs your business’s financial back office so you don’t have to: our aim is to provide our customers..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"lfranchi"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"San Francisco (Onsite, Hybrid) : Full time\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"lfranchi\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39900983\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.06,"words":317},"filePathRelative":"hn/April-2024/lfranchi-SanFrancisco(Onsite_Hybrid)-Fulltime.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{m as comp,d as data};
