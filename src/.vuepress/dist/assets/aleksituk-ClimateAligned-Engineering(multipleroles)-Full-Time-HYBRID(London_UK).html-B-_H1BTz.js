We also have extensive industry networks, published works, and numerous advisory and working group seats in climate and sustainable finance.</p><p>We&#39;re looking for people to play a foundational role on this big mission:</p><ul><li><p>Senior Backend Engineer (Python)</p></li><li><p>(Research) ML Engineer (LLMs)</p></li><li><p>Mid level fullstack Engineer</p></li><li><p>Others (opportunistic)</p></li></ul><p>We have raised our pre-seed round from top European climate-focused investors (Pale Blue Dot &amp; Frontline Ventures) and we just did a private product launch at COP28 in December.
