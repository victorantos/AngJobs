We are best known for having created the first working laser.</p><p>We are doing R&amp;D on quantum computing, from fabrication to algorithms, all in-house, using a tech called exchange-only silicon dot qubits. We are looking for both senior engineering and management to help build out our compiler stack for a quantum programming language. We recently presented it, along with our language-oriented development approach, at the biggest physics conference: APS March Meeting. [1]</p><p>The quantum computing group uses Common Lisp, Coalton, Python, C++, and JavaScript to build a state-of-the-art operating system for physicists researching silicon dot quantum computers. Compiler development is done primarily in Common Lisp.</p><p>Those who are excellent programmers experienced with</p><ul><li><p>functional programming, and/or Lisp, and/or statically typed ML-descendants;</p></li><li><p>compilers, machine architecture;</p></li><li><p>and solid undergraduate mathematics and advanced computer science</p></li></ul><p>are most qualified. We can train you on Lisp, Coalton, and quantum if the fundamentals are there. Knowledge of quantum computing is <em>not</em> necessary for most software engineering roles.</p><p>Interview process: phone call, &quot;take-home&quot; exercise, on-site interview (no whiteboarding), reference checks, and offer.</p><p>Candidates must be eligible to obtain and maintain a U.S. security clearance, and must be willing to relocate to southern California.</p><p>Compiler Engineer job: <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/dodmg/af802f7f-4e44-4457-9e49-14bc47bd8b31" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.lever.co/dodmg/af802f7f-4e44-4457-9e49-14bc47bd...</a></p><p>Other HRL Quantum roles: <a href="https://quantum.hrl.com/careers/" rel="nofollow">https://quantum.hrl.com/careers/</a></p><p>Reach out to the email in my profile with a letter and resume, or apply for a role directly through the website.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://youtu.be/F8TezGqCvE8" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/F8TezGqCvE8</a></p>',13),i=[n];function s(m,p){return t(),o("div",null,i)}const u=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","reikonomusha-HRLLaboratories-CommonLisp-ONSITE-LosAngeles_California.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/February-2024/reikonomusha-HRLLaboratories-CommonLisp-ONSITE-LosAngeles_California.html","title":"HRL Laboratories : Common Lisp","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"HRL Laboratories : Common Lisp","author":{"name":"reikonomusha","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39219100"},"description":"HRL Laboratories - Senior Software Engineer; Principal Compiler Engineer - Common Lisp - ONSITE - Los Angeles, California - https://quantum.hrl.com/ HRL Laboratories is a privat...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/February-2024/reikonomusha-HRLLaboratories-CommonLisp-ONSITE-LosAngeles_California.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"HRL Laboratories : Common Lisp"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"HRL Laboratories - Senior Software Engineer; Principal Compiler Engineer - Common Lisp - ONSITE - Los Angeles, California - https://quantum.hrl.com/ HRL Laboratories is a privat..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"reikonomusha"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"HRL Laboratories : Common Lisp\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"reikonomusha\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39219100\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1718921316000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":3}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.21,"words":363},"filePathRelative":"hn/February-2024/reikonomusha-HRLLaboratories-CommonLisp-ONSITE-LosAngeles_California.md","localizedDate":"June 21, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{u as comp,h as data};
