ML engineers at Continua work on new approaches for knowledge representation, multimodality, and personalization under computational resource constraints. Systems engineers at Continua work on a wide variety of secure and reliable backend services and data pipelines to power our products. We’re backed by tier-1 VCs, and we’ve already assembled a team of seven engineers with backgrounds at Google, Slack, CourseHero, Stash, and Amazon. We have a limited number of additional spots available on the team for engineers who are excited about building innovative products that leverage the latest advances in ML, including Transformers / Mamba, RLHF, LoRA/QLoRA, at-edge (on-device) training and inference, privacy-first ML, and more.</p><p>If you are passionate about building innovative new products, and you’re eager to work in a dynamic startup environment, we would love to hear from you.
