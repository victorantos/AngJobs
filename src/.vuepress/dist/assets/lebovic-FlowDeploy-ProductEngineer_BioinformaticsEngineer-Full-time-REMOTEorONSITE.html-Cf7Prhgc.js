I think a former or future founder would do well in this role.</p><p>Curiosity matters more than domain-specific experience in bioinformatics, although some bioinformatics context is helpful: understanding if what you&#39;ve built solves a problem requires talking to users and understanding them.</p><p>You would be working in a few key areas of our product:</p><ul><li><p>Improving our integration with bioinformatics pipelining languages like Nextflow and Snakemake.</p></li><li><p>Building our core API. This is currently written with Express/Node.js with a Postgres database.</p></li><li><p>Building the UI for launching, monitoring, and sharing bioinformatics pipelines and data. This is currently written in React with Typescript.</p></li><li><p>Improving our pipeline execution. This is mostly in AWS Batch.</p></li><li><p>Improving our data handling. Most raw data is stored in S3, with metadata in a Postgres database.</p></li></ul><p>We&#39;re a very small team, and we plan to stay small until we have strong product-market fit. We&#39;re funded by Y Combinator, have revenue from the FlowDeploy product, and can keep going for years without raising additional funding.</p><p>Interested?
