Aim to relieve teachers and admin workers of tedious &quot;easy&quot; questions so they can focus on important cases. Moving towards knowledge management and course support.</p><p>Early startup, small, tightly knit team (5 engineers, 2 implementation/process-focused folks, 1 sales guy, 1 marketing gal, 1 chill product-centered CEO). We&#39;re slowly scaling and expanding.</p><p>Stack (not crucial but you should at least be proficient in python):</p><ul><li>FastAPI python backend</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>Langchain for the AI aspects, slowly moving away from it</li><li>Next.js (react) frontend</li><li>AWS</li></ul><p>We have two open roles. Common requirements: excellent spoken English, a generalist/&quot;get things done&quot; mentality (we&#39;re a small startup), and sufficient drive/curiosity to figure things out (and build them/fix them) on your own - we don&#39;t micromanage.</p><ul><li>Junior/mid AI/backend engineer: you&#39;d start off supporting me with developing the AI aspects of the product - for now, mainly the conversational interface. This isn&#39;t a purely ML position; for now lots of the work is SWE/back-end dev. Projects on the roadmap: migrating away from Langchain, building robust testing and observability for LLM performance, experimenting with and improving the RAG pipeline, fine-tuning/distillation where relevant to reduce latency/costs.</li></ul><p>Experience requirements: ~masters level education in relevant field (doesn&#39;t have to be a masters/formal education, but you need to convince us you have an equivalent level of experience/understanding) &amp; 1y of full-time relevant work experience (can be as student job)</p><ul><li>Junior/mid QA engineer (part time, can be negotiated). Two main aspects to this:</li></ul><ol><li>Improve and expand our back-end tests; in particular, add E2E and integration tests</li><li>Manual QA as part of our release cycle, which you will then slowly automate with browser automation tools (selenium).</li></ol><p>Experience requirements: ~bachelor level in relevant field &amp; 1y+ of relevant QA experience OR ~3-4 years of highly relevant work experience.</p><p>Send e-mail at <code>luca @ learnwise . ai</code> with brief intro + CV ðŸ˜ƒ</p>",12),r=[a];function l(s,c){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const d=e(o,[["render",l],["__file","Ldorigo-Learnwise_ai.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/jobs/July-2024/Ldorigo-Learnwise_ai.html","title":"Learnwise.ai","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Learnwise.ai","author":{"name":"Ldorigo","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40854271"},"description":"Learnwise.ai - Junior-Mid AI/ML/Backend Engineer (fulltime) + Junior-Mid QA engineer (part-time) - REMOTE (EU timezone if freelance contract OR Spain/NL for employee contract) -...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/jobs/July-2024/Ldorigo-Learnwise_ai.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Learnwise.ai"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Learnwise.ai - Junior-Mid AI/ML/Backend Engineer (fulltime) + Junior-Mid QA engineer (part-time) - REMOTE (EU timezone if freelance contract OR Spain/NL for employee contract) -..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-07-02T12:22:16.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Ldorigo"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-07-02T12:22:16.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Learnwise.ai\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-07-02T12:22:16.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Ldorigo\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40854271\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719922936000,"updatedTime":1719922936000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.37,"words":410},"filePathRelative":"jobs/July-2024/Ldorigo-Learnwise_ai.md","localizedDate":"July 2, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,u as data};
