Since our launch three years ago, we&#39;ve demonstrated the viability of our model with a product protecting the shipping industry from changes in fuel price, and are now undergoing a large expansion into other sectors - particularly renewables and decarbonisation. Our new product for wind and solar farms protects them from falls in the price of electricity, and so makes investing in renewable power safer.</p><p>I have been Paratus&#39;s CTO / sole full-time developer at Paratus for three years (working with specialist contractors as required for UX, security etc), but we&#39;re looking to increase the team size to four to support substantially increased demand and expansion of the company. Our initial role will be to support the sales team by maintaining and enhancing our pricing model, with a natural pivot into expanding our books-and-records system as sales pick up. In the medium term, there&#39;s the prospect of interesting new development work as increased capacity allows us to automate new parts of the business flow.</p><p>Senior Developer - £100k+ (negotiable depending on experience/fit etc)</p><p>The key thing we&#39;re looking for from our second developer hire is that they should be able to stand in for me in a pinch. Specifically:</p><p>• You should be comfortable and familiar with the core of our tech stack (Java / Spring / PostgreSQL / AWS).</p><p>• You should need be able to get up to speed quickly on an unfamiliar project and, after a short period of orientation, be able to self-teach / find your way around on your own.</p><p>• A key requirement is that you should be able to cover for me if I become sick or unavailable - you should quickly reach the point where you can reliably carry out urgent development work unsupported.</p><p>• A mathematical background would be a plus - our pricing model is somewhat technical and one of the key things we need to support.</p><p>• As the team grows, you should be able to skill up quickly enough to be able to support and mentor less experienced developers who still need some help finding their way around.</p><p>• Being able to assist with interview and recruitment processes would also be a plus.</p><p>Developer - £60k-85k</p><p>• You should have experience writing software as part of a team, using Git or other version control.</p><p>• You should know how to write automated tests and understand why they are important.</p><p>• You don&#39;t need to have the depth of experience necessary to become fully autonomous on day one, but once you understand a task and the area of the codebase you&#39;re changing, you should be capable of working reliably and independently.</p><p>Please email a CV / cover letter to careers@paratusltd.com to apply.</p>",16),i=[r];function s(l,p){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const d=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","iam27-ParatusLtd-REMOTE_occasionaldaysONSITEinLondon(UK)aplus-Full-time.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/January-2024/iam27-ParatusLtd-REMOTE_occasionaldaysONSITEinLondon(UK)aplus-Full-time.html","title":"Paratus Ltd : REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Paratus Ltd : REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus","author":{"name":"iam27","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38843305"},"description":"Paratus Ltd - REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus - Full-time Paratus is a young company with a first-of-a-kind insurance product to protect businesses from pri...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/January-2024/iam27-ParatusLtd-REMOTE_occasionaldaysONSITEinLondon(UK)aplus-Full-time.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Paratus Ltd : REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Paratus Ltd - REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus - Full-time Paratus is a young company with a first-of-a-kind insurance product to protect businesses from pri..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"iam27"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Paratus Ltd : REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"iam27\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38843305\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.71,"words":513},"filePathRelative":"hn/January-2024/iam27-ParatusLtd-REMOTE_occasionaldaysONSITEinLondon(UK)aplus-Full-time.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,m as data};
