Our first product is SDKs as a service. When you <code>npm install openai</code> or <code>pip install openai</code>, for example, you’re downloading code that we generated. (I built the codegen system at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)</p><p>Next, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right. We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.</p><p>We’re about 2y old, under 10 people, have strong revenue, and are selling to companies you interact with every day (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare are all customers). We’re backed by Sequoia.</p><p>As a founding engineer, you’ll get autonomy to build great products, skilled peers, opportunity for tremendous impact, competitive salary, and a very competitive ownership stake.</p><p>We’re looking for exceptionally productive, thoughtful, tasteful, and kind people with a passion for making software development better for everyone.</p><p>Want to build the future of API tooling?
