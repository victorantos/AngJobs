Many central &amp; distributed IT systems are fed by the Registries, which take information from disparate sources, and combine them into single views of Organizations, People, Accounts, Courses, Groups, etc.. MaIS provides XML &amp; JSON APIs to interact with the Registries, as well as feeding information into LDAP. They also implement business logic, mapping student and employee careers into account &amp; service lifetimes, group memberships, and more.</p><p>MaIS apps are almost exclusively Java (using Spring). Tomcat and the Oracle Application Express (Apex) platforms are used as middlewares. The database is, of course, Oracle (with PL/SQL). Knowing any of the following would be a plus: HTML5, JQuery, shell scripting, and SnapLogic.</p><p>MaIS are looking for three people:</p><p>• IT Software Developer: You&#39;ll be working on existing Registry code, fixing bugs, and implementing enhancements.
