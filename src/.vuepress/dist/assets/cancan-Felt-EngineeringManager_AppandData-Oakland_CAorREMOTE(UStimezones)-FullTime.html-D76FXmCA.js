It&#39;s surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. Climate change and the resulting natural disasters are forcing even more people to become map-makers, and Felt is here to meet that need. It&#39;s the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I&#39;m an early Uber engineer.</p><p>We are on the lookout for a hands-on engineering manager for our application and data teams. Our application team builds what our end-users experience; a lightning fast and easy-to-use mapping tool that works in the browser. We are primarily using Elixir / Phoenix on the server side and have a spatially focused React on the frontend side. As an engineering manager, you&#39;ll be working with folks who are experts in their field [2], release more than 15+ a day [3], and aren&#39;t afraid to break new ground when necessary [4].</p><p>Our data team makes geospatial datasets a breeze to work with and we are currently building our next-generation of our data stack on AWS. The team you&#39;ll be managing is full of expert engineers from Facebook, Carto, Mapbox, and Uber. You might have used their work in mapping already; such as Tippecanoe. We also recently announced our sponsorship of QGIS [5] and have some amazing stuff planned in the next couple of quarters.</p><p>We are well-funded and just raised our $15M Series A. You can read more about it our funding here [6], and our announcement here [6]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[7]</p><p>If you are an experienced manager, please reach out via hello@felt.com and mention HN.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/" rel="nofollow">https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-r...</a> [2] <a href="https://felt.com/blog/svg-to-canvas-part-2-building-interactions" rel="nofollow">https://felt.com/blog/svg-to-canvas-part-2-building-interact...</a> [3] <a href="https://felt.com/blog/how-felt-deploys-15-times-a-day" rel="nofollow">https://felt.com/blog/how-felt-deploys-15-times-a-day</a> [4] <a href="https://digest.browsertech.com/archive/browsetech-digest-felt-is-making-browsers-make/" rel="nofollow">https://digest.browsertech.com/archive/browsetech-digest-fel...</a> [5] <a href="https://felt.com/blog/felt-flagship-member-of-qgis" rel="nofollow">https://felt.com/blog/felt-flagship-member-of-qgis</a> [6] <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/31/felt-maps-15-million-series-a/" rel="nofollow">https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/31/felt-maps-15-million-serie...</a> [7] <a href="https://felt.com/blog/public-beta-15m-series-a" rel="nofollow">https://felt.com/blog/public-beta-15m-series-a</a></p>',7),i=[r];function s(l,p){return t(),a("div",null,i)}const h=e(o,[["render",s],["__file","cancan-Felt-EngineeringManager_AppandData-Oakland_CAorREMOTE(UStimezones)-FullTime.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/hn/January-2024/cancan-Felt-EngineeringManager_AppandData-Oakland_CAorREMOTE(UStimezones)-FullTime.html","title":"Felt : Engineering Manager, App and Data","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Felt : Engineering Manager, App and Data","author":{"name":"cancan","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38849666"},"description":"Felt - Engineering Manager, App and Data - Oakland, CA or REMOTE (US timezones) - Full Time - https://felt.com Felt is the best way to make maps on the internet.
