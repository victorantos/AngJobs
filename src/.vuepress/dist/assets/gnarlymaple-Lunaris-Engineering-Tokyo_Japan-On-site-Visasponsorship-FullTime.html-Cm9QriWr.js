As such, many of us here have a huge passion for anime, gaming, or Japanese pop culture in general. It’s not unusual to see an anime figure sitting on someone’s desk, the latest League of Legends tournament streaming on our lounge television, or hear someone discussing their past adventures on Final Fantasy XI.</p><p>However, our passion doesn’t stop there – we’re a team of self-starters who are driven by results. As Solaris Japan continued its success and our customer base grew, we sought solutions to serve our customers, and added Shopify to our toolkit. We then built a number of custom applications for ourself and automated many of our processes, and realized we could offer these solutions to other e-commerce platforms as well. Thus, Lunaris was born, and with it additional e-commerce solutions like easyPoints, easyRates, and more.</p><p>We are a team of international engineers, and are actively seeking a few more engineers to join our growing team:</p><ul><li><p>Senior/Lead Engineer - <a href="https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/senior-lead-developer" rel="nofollow">https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/senior-lead-developer</a></p></li><li><p>Fullstack Engineer - <a href="https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/full-stack-developer" rel="nofollow">https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/full-stack-developer</a></p></li></ul><p>Tech stack: Elixir, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, React (mostly JS)</p><p>If Lunaris sounds like a good fit for you, and you&#39;re ready for a new experience in Japan (or already living here), please check out the above positions and send in your application.</p><p>Of course, if you have any other questions, feel free to reach us at jobs@lunaris.jp</p>',8),i=[s];function r(l,p){return a(),n("div",null,i)}const c=e(t,[["render",r],["__file","gnarlymaple-Lunaris-Engineering-Tokyo_Japan-On-site-Visasponsorship-FullTime.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/January-2024/gnarlymaple-Lunaris-Engineering-Tokyo_Japan-On-site-Visasponsorship-FullTime.html","title":"Lunaris : Engineering","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Lunaris : Engineering","author":{"name":"gnarlymaple","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38906711"},"description":"Lunaris - Engineering - Tokyo, Japan - On-site - Visa sponsorship - Full Time - https://teamlunaris.com/ Lunaris started out as an otaku-centric online shop called Solaris Japan...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/January-2024/gnarlymaple-Lunaris-Engineering-Tokyo_Japan-On-site-Visasponsorship-FullTime.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Lunaris : Engineering"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Lunaris - Engineering - Tokyo, Japan - On-site - Visa sponsorship - Full Time - https://teamlunaris.com/ Lunaris started out as an otaku-centric online shop called Solaris Japan..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"gnarlymaple"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Lunaris : Engineering\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"gnarlymaple\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38906711\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.15,"words":346},"filePathRelative":"hn/January-2024/gnarlymaple-Lunaris-Engineering-Tokyo_Japan-On-site-Visasponsorship-FullTime.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{c as comp,g as data};
