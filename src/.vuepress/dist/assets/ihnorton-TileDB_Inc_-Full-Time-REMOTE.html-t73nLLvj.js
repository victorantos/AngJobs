You will have the opportunity to work on innovative technology that creates impact for challenging problems in genomics, geospatial, machine learning, distributed systems, and many other areas.</p><p>TileDB Cloud is the modern database, allowing developers and scientists to capture, analyze, and share any data with any tool. We build on a broad foundation of open source, maintaining the TileDB storage engine, libraries for genomics (single-cell and population), geospatial (raster, point clouds, and more), a TileDB visualization engine extending Babylon.js, and much more ([github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB](<a href="http://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB">http://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB</a>))</p><p>With TileDB, all data — tables, genomics, images, videos, location, time-series — is captured as multi-dimensional arrays. To supercharge this data, TileDB Cloud implements a serverless infrastructure delivering query execution, access control, data and code sharing, and distributed computing at global scale — eliminating cluster management, minimizing TCO, and promoting scientific collaboration and reproducibility.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://tiledb.com" rel="nofollow">https://tiledb.com</a> - GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB">https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB</a> - Blog: <a href="https://tiledb.com/blog" rel="nofollow">https://tiledb.com/blog</a></p><p>We are actively hiring for several roles including:</p><ul><li><p>Site Reliability Engineer (k8s, Terraform, automation, Prometheus, CloudWatch, GitOps; Golang, Python)</p></li><li><p>Senior+ Software Engineer: Backend and distributed systems (Golang, CGo, k8s, Terraform, MySQL/MariaDB)</p></li><li><p>Senior+ Software Engineer: Database internals (parsing, query planning, execution, distributed execution; Rust or C++ experience strongly preferred, other systems languages if paired with exceptional expertise)</p></li><li><p>Front-end/UI developer: Typescript, React; ideally some additional mix of AWS/Azure/GCS platform experience, Golang, Docker, or other relevant skills.</p></li></ul><p>Apply today at <a href="https://tiledb.workable.com" rel="nofollow">https://tiledb.workable.com</a> or reach out directly (email in profile).</p>',8),l=[a];function r(s,c){return i(),t("div",null,l)}const d=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","ihnorton-TileDB_Inc_-Full-Time-REMOTE.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/jobs/May-2024/ihnorton-TileDB_Inc_-Full-Time-REMOTE.html","title":"TileDB, Inc. : Full-Time","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"TileDB, Inc. : Full-Time","author":{"name":"ihnorton","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40227445"},"description":"TileDB, Inc. - Full-Time - REMOTE - USA, Greece/EU - https://tiledb.com/ TileDB has recently announced a $34 million Series B fund-raise and is actively hiring for engineers acr...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/jobs/May-2024/ihnorton-TileDB_Inc_-Full-Time-REMOTE.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"TileDB, Inc. : Full-Time"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"TileDB, Inc. - Full-Time - REMOTE - USA, Greece/EU - https://tiledb.com/ TileDB has recently announced a $34 million Series B fund-raise and is actively hiring for engineers acr..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ihnorton"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"TileDB, Inc. : Full-Time\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"ihnorton\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40227445\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719852904000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.31,"words":393},"filePathRelative":"jobs/May-2024/ihnorton-TileDB_Inc_-Full-Time-REMOTE.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,h as data};
