We work on the forefront of computational genomics by applying advanced computational techniques to analyzing genomics data then sharing that data with the world. Come work with the individuals that wrote the Rust-based bioinformatics library, noodles (<a href="https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles">https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles</a>), as well as many other projects (<a href="https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs">https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs</a>).</p><p>NOTE that prior experience in bioinformatics or biology is NOT required for any of the positions below. We&#39;re just looking for amazing engineers, but rest assured, we teach biology/genomics/bioinformatics from scratch routinely. You must be interested in learning though! If you&#39;d like to get a sense of what you&#39;d be learning, check out the guide we wrote to teach software engineers about genomics here: <a href="https://learngenomics.dev" rel="nofollow">https://learngenomics.dev</a>.</p><ul><li><p>Principal: <a href="https://talent.stjude.org/careers/jobs/JR1800?lang=en-us" rel="nofollow">https://talent.stjude.org/careers/jobs/JR1800?lang=en-us</a></p></li><li><p>Senior Staff: <a href="https://talent.stjude.org/careers/jobs/JR1801?lang=en-us" rel="nofollow">https://talent.stjude.org/careers/jobs/JR1801?lang=en-us</a></p></li><li><p>Staff: <a href="https://talent.stjude.org/careers/jobs/JR1564?lang=en-us" rel="nofollow">https://talent.stjude.org/careers/jobs/JR1564?lang=en-us</a></p></li></ul>',4),n=[a];function i(l,c){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const u=e(s,[["render",i],["__file","clmcleod-Memphis_TN-ONSITEorREMOTE.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/hn/February-2024/clmcleod-Memphis_TN-ONSITEorREMOTE.html","title":"Memphis, TN : ONSITE or REMOTE","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Memphis, TN : ONSITE or REMOTE","author":{"name":"clmcleod","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39220640"},"description":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital - Principal/Senior Staff/Staff Software Engineer, Rust Genomics Infrastructure - Memphis, TN - ONSITE or REMOTE - https://www.stjude.cloud/...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/February-2024/clmcleod-Memphis_TN-ONSITEorREMOTE.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Memphis, TN : ONSITE or REMOTE"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital - Principal/Senior Staff/Staff Software Engineer, Rust Genomics Infrastructure - Memphis, TN - ONSITE or REMOTE - https://www.stjude.cloud/..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"clmcleod"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Memphis, TN : ONSITE or REMOTE\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"clmcleod\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39220640\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.16,"words":349},"filePathRelative":"hn/February-2024/clmcleod-Memphis_TN-ONSITEorREMOTE.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}`);export{u as comp,m as data};
