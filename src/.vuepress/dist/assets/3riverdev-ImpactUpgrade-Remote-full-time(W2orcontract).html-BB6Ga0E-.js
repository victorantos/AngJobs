We’re looking for a new team member to position as a fullstack developer, working on both client projects and internal products. We do have specialties and tools we often reach for, but we strive to be flexible generalists. So although there are a few areas that you need to have in your background, we otherwise bend over backwards to keep things simple.</p><p>Must-haves:</p><pre><code>    Development experience with Django/Python.
    Expertise with vanilla Javascript and jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
    Exposure to Bootstrap (we typically use Material Design for Bootstrap).
    An emphasis on mobile-first, responsive design with digital accessibility as a high priority.
    Experience with any RDBMS (we’re typically on postgres or mysql/mariadb).
    Experience with API integration and automation.
    A consultant’s mindset. Assume nothing you find has to be the way it is. Ability to keep eyes open for better/easier/simpler/cheaper ways of doing things, recommend them, and oversee improvements.
    Ability to work independently in ambiguous and dynamic environments.
    Understand that some projects demand enterprise/hardened development, others a looser get-it-done approach, and others a mix — and know when each is appropriate.
    Previous experience as a remote team member.
    Fun, easy going, and service-centered heart. Our primary focus is serving missions as well as helping organizations’ staff in any tech-centric way we can.
</code></pre><p>Nice-to-haves:</p><pre><code>    Experience working both on client projects as a consultant as well as direct product development.
    Exposure to other full-stack ecosystems. PHP, Ruby on Rails, and others periodically come up.
    Exposure to Stripe and/or Square.
    Exposure to WordPress.
