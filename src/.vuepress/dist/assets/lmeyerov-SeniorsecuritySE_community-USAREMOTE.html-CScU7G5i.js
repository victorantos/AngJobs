  About: Graphistry sales are growing beyond our small team, as are our Louie.AI cohorts, so we're looking for a security SE to work with our senior team as the tip-of-the-spear for our go-to-market. We're already doing a variety of 5-7 figure deals, including with 3 of the 5 FVEYs nations, with half the activity in different investigative domains like cybersecurity.

  Responsibilities: Varies based on candidate -

  * Primary - pre/post sales engineering: Calls, demos, support, implementation, especially around cybersecurity and other investigative domains

  * Community/DevRel: Integrations, public demos/talks/social media

  * Enterprise/Tech accounts around investigative tech, especially security

  * Gov BD: SBIRs, special DoD/IC programs, ...
 
  * Special projects: Help with our bigger Graphistry/Louie.AI accounts as mission projects establish big new platform capabilities

  Experience in Python, GPU data science, LLM/GenAI, blue team (Splunk, IR/hunt), OSINT, and enterprise/fintech/IC/DoD all helpful.
