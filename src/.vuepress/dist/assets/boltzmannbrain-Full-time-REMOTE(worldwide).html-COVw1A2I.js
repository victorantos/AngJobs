Our product aim is to enable in-silico playgrounds for human-machine teams experimenting and building in industrial R&amp;D, energy security, &amp; advanced manufacturing arenas. As a public-benefit for-profit startup, our mission is Nobel-Turing [1] technologies to advance science and society for all humankind.</p><p>The pursuit calls for industry hardened and intellectually curious builders who thrive in interdisciplinary territories that are often less-traveled. The team brings deep, diverse expertise from Deepmind, Cerebras, Vicarious, SpaceX, NASA, CERN, Sandia, Nvidia, Autodesk, and more. With fresh venture funding and Fortune500 customers (+dozens more on the waitlist), we&#39;re looking for ambitious, intellectually curious software engineers that can consistently contribute in non-trivial, impressive ways as we ship and scale our flagship product platform — some call it &quot;live intelligent digital twins&quot; and others say &quot;cyberphysical testbeds for AGI&quot;, while most view Pasteur Labs product catalogue as &quot;Unity for industrial R&amp;D.&quot;</p><p>With HQ in Brooklyn NY [2], we are an internationally distributed team running remote full-time — from San Diego to Stockholm and everywhere in-between. The full team gathers 2x per year for Pasteur Labs &quot;onsites&quot;, alternating sites such as Montreal, Amsterdam, Austin, London, NYC etc.</p><p>-&gt; <a href="https://simulation.science/careers" rel="nofollow">https://simulation.science/careers</a></p><p>While we don&#39;t list requirements for degrees or years-experience, everyone needs to demonstrate high-caliber engineering and problem-solving in multiple domains; we&#39;re dedicated to scientific rigor and robust engineering for complex and dynamic environments, so prove to us that you not only fit in but that you can make us better.</p><p>If what we’re doing speaks to you, please get in touch!
