Together, you can build and host a full-stack web application - and all you need is a little Python. (Yes, even the client-side code - we compile Python to JS and provide a GUI framework!)</p><p>We’re looking for an experienced all-rounder to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on the back-end. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but we&#39;re looking for someone who isn&#39;t afraid to jump into something you haven&#39;t used before.</p><p>You’ll be working with other seriously good all-rounders, including the founders (relevant PhDs, kernel contributors, builders of backyard dancing fountains) and senior colleagues (eg: a former maths teacher who reverse-engineered our drag&#39;n&#39;drop editor to build more UI components), as well as our other developers and developer advocates. We&#39;re bootstrapped and profitable, with a small, smart, friendly and diverse team.</p><p>Building dev tools is great! We&#39;re solving problems we&#39;ve experienced ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms have the most fun engineering problems.</p><p>For full job descriptions, and to hear what it&#39;s like working here, go to <a href="https://anvil.works/jobs" rel="nofollow">https://anvil.works/jobs</a>.</p><p>We work hybrid (in the office Tue-Thu, wherever you like Mon/Fri).
