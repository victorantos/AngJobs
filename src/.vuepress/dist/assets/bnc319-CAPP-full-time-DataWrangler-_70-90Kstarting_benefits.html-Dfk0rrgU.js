Our team is looking for an additional hire to work on a myriad of pricing and data tasks. We are currently sprinting the processing of manufacturer and vendor product data and pricing, in order to expand our eCommerce offerings and enable all of our product lines to be offered for sale digitally. We have built out tools that use Python and other libraries to help automate data inflow and processing.
