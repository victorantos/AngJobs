Customers use Quobyte DCFS for ML and HPC clusters in industry and academia, k8s and OpenStack infrastructures, streaming, web mail, post production, origin and CGI clusters, and as a scalable backend for SaaS products. There are Quobyte DCFS clusters which span thousands of machines and crunch 100s of GB/s!</p><p>Under the hood, <em>DCFS</em> is a full-stack storage system, written in Java and C++. The engineering work covers everything from kernel development over our own replicated database system design to distributed algorithms (Paxos!) and performance. In short: lots of real-world challenging and fun problems! We work as a highly efficient engineering team, and do mandatory code reviews, lots of unit and integration testing,</p><p>Santa Clara, CA:</p><ul><li><p>Customer Success Engineer</p></li><li><p>Sales Engineer</p></li></ul><p>Berlin, Germany:</p><ul><li><p>Software Engineer</p></li><li><p>Sales Executive</p></li><li><p>Marketing Manager</p></li></ul><p>For detailed job descriptions please and application process, please visit <a href="https://www.quobyte.com/company/careers" rel="nofollow">https://www.quobyte.com/company/careers</a> or write to work at quobyte.com.</p>',8),i=[o];function l(s,m){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const d=e(r,[["render",l],["__file","fh973-QUOBYTE-SantaClara_CAandBerlin_Germany-Full-time-ONSITE.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/February-2024/fh973-QUOBYTE-SantaClara_CAandBerlin_Germany-Full-time-ONSITE.html","title":"QUOBYTE : Santa Clara, CA and Berlin, Germany","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"QUOBYTE : Santa Clara, CA and Berlin, Germany","author":{"name":"fh973","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39220949"},"description":"QUOBYTE - Santa Clara, CA and Berlin, Germany - Full-time - ONSITE - https://www.quobyte.com/ At Quobyte, we are working on the Data Center File System (DCFS), a highly scalable...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/February-2024/fh973-QUOBYTE-SantaClara_CAandBerlin_Germany-Full-time-ONSITE.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"QUOBYTE : Santa Clara, CA and Berlin, Germany"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"QUOBYTE - Santa Clara, CA and Berlin, Germany - Full-time - ONSITE - https://www.quobyte.com/ At Quobyte, we are working on the Data Center File System (DCFS), a highly scalable..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"fh973"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"QUOBYTE : Santa Clara, CA and Berlin, Germany\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"fh973\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39220949\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.8,"words":239},"filePathRelative":"hn/February-2024/fh973-QUOBYTE-SantaClara_CAandBerlin_Germany-Full-time-ONSITE.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,u as data};
