Where other AI companies see only words, we see the other half of human communication: subtle tones of voice, word emphasis, facial expression, and more. These behaviors reveal our preferencesâ€”whether we find things interesting or boring; satisfying or frustrating; funny, eloquent, or dubious. Trained with billions of human expressions, our LLMs will be better question answerers, copywriters, tutors, call center agents, and more.</p><p>Our goal is to enable a future where technology draws on an understanding of human emotional expression to better serve our goals and support our well-being. We currently provide API access to our expression measurement models to help developers build better healthcare solutions, digital assistants, communication tools, and more, optimizing their products for human well-being. We&#39;re also building a groundbreaking, first-of-its-kind empathic voice assistant.</p><p>We&#39;re seeking technical talent interested in working with our research team to build state-of-the-art LLMs and scale up our systems. Our new LLM training method - reinforcement learning from human expression (RLHE) - learns human preferences from behavior in millions of audio and video recordings, making LLMs superhumanly helpful, interesting, funny, eloquent, honest, and altruistic. Join us in the heart of New York City and contribute to our endeavor to ensure that AI is guided by human values, the most pivotal challenge and opportunity of the 21st century.</p><p>As part of our mission, we also conduct groundbreaking scientific research, publish in leading scientific journals like Nature, and support a non-profit, The Hume Initiative, that has released the first concrete ethical guidelines for empathic AI (www.thehumeinitiative.org).</p><p>You can learn more about us on our website (<a href="https://hume.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://hume.ai/</a>) and read about us in Axios (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/26/startup-ai-emotions-hume" rel="nofollow">https://www.axios.com/2023/01/26/startup-ai-emotions-hume</a>) and The Washington Post (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/17/artificial-intelligence-ai-empathy-emotions/" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/17/artific...</a>).</p>',7),o=[a];function s(l,c){return n(),t("div",null,o)}const h=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","humeAI-HumeAI-Full-time-AIResearchEngineer_BackendServicesEngineer_DataEngineer_MachineLearningE.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/January-2024/humeAI-HumeAI-Full-time-AIResearchEngineer_BackendServicesEngineer_DataEngineer_MachineLearningE.html","title":"Hume AI : Full-time","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Hume AI : Full-time","author":{"name":"humeAI","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38860944"},"description":"Hume AI - Full-time - Onsite (NYC, Sunnyvale / Bay Area) or remote - AI Research Engineer, Backend Services Engineer, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer Apply here: https:...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/January-2024/humeAI-HumeAI-Full-time-AIResearchEngineer_BackendServicesEngineer_DataEngineer_MachineLearningE.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Hume AI : Full-time"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Hume AI - Full-time - Onsite (NYC, Sunnyvale / Bay Area) or remote - AI Research Engineer, Backend Services Engineer, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer Apply here: https:..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"humeAI"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Hume AI : Full-time\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"humeAI\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38860944\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.51,"words":454},"filePathRelative":"hn/January-2024/humeAI-HumeAI-Full-time-AIResearchEngineer_BackendServicesEngineer_DataEngineer_MachineLearningE.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{h as comp,p as data};
