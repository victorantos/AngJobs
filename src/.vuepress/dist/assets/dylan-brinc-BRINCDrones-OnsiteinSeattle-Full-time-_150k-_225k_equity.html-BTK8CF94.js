Our technology lets first responders get eyes and ears on what&#39;s happening in indoor structures when it&#39;s too dangerous for people to enter - whether it be a fire, medical emergency, violence, or search and rescue. In March 2023, we released the Lemur 2, our latest and most advanced drone, and we started shipping it to customers the same year.</p><p>In addition to launching more advanced drones, we&#39;re also expanding our software ecosystem into realtime monitoring and fleet management, and we recently shipped the first version of our first web app: LiveOps. This app gives drone operators and first response teams access to real-time live-streaming drone data such as visual and thermal video feeds, 3D map data via point clouds, and a myriad of drone telemetry – it’s essentially a web-based drone fleet management software. But our vision isn’t just fleet management; LiveOps represents a critical part of BRINC’s transition from a company that just sells drones to a company that sells entire drone programs: we want to build out the entire drone ecosystem (both hardware and software) for our customers.</p><p>It’s an ambitious goal, but it’s one that we feel confident about – we’ve got a lot of interest from customers in what we’ve built so far, and we are seeking both a full-stack and a backend/platform engineer to join our engineering team and own the development of this web app and cloud ecosystem.</p><p>Job Postings:</p><ul><li><p>Senior/Principal Full-stack Engineer: <a href="https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f82f3d388d?rs=42706078" rel="nofollow">https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f...</a></p></li><li><p>Senior/Principal Backend &amp; Platform Engineer: <a href="https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5c5d97e904?rs=42706078" rel="nofollow">https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5...</a></p></li></ul><p>Some recent press:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-with-the-23-year-old-founder-who-landed-openais-ceo-as-an-investor/" rel="nofollow">https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-wit...</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/" rel="nofollow">https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/</a></p></li></ul><p>I&#39;m the founding engineer for the cloud services engineering team at BRINC, so feel free to relay any questions about the role to me (dylan at brinc drones dot com, parse it yourself), but please apply through the job posting if you&#39;re interested in the role so that we can keep track of you!</p>',9),i=[a];function s(l,c){return n(),t("div",null,i)}const m=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","dylan-brinc-BRINCDrones-OnsiteinSeattle-Full-time-_150k-_225k_equity.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/March-2024/dylan-brinc-BRINCDrones-OnsiteinSeattle-Full-time-_150k-_225k_equity.html","title":"BRINC Drones : Onsite in Seattle","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"BRINC Drones : Onsite in Seattle","author":{"name":"dylan-brinc","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39594462"},"description":"BRINC Drones - https://brincdrones.com/ - Onsite in Seattle - Full-time - $150k-$225k + equity BRINC Drones helps first responders with products that quickly and effectively res...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/hn/March-2024/dylan-brinc-BRINCDrones-OnsiteinSeattle-Full-time-_150k-_225k_equity.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"BRINC Drones : Onsite in Seattle"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"BRINC Drones - https://brincdrones.com/ - Onsite in Seattle - Full-time - $150k-$225k + equity BRINC Drones helps first responders with products that quickly and effectively res..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"dylan-brinc"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"BRINC Drones : Onsite in Seattle\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-06-27T14:33:12.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"dylan-brinc\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39594462\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719498792000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.76,"words":528},"filePathRelative":"hn/March-2024/dylan-brinc-BRINCDrones-OnsiteinSeattle-Full-time-$150k-$225k+equity.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{m as comp,h as data};
