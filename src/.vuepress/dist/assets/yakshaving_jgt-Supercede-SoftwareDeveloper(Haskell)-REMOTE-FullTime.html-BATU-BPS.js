You should be able to communicate clearly in English, but you do not need to speak English natively.

We don&#39;t do daily stand-ups. We don&#39;t count your hours. We don&#39;t work weekends. We support each other in working and learning, and we have 20% time where programmers are able to work on open source and/or research projects.
