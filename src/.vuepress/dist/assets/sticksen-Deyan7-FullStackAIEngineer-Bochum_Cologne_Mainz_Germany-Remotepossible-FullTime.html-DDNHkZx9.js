Since the launch of GPT4 in March, we have implemented projects in areas such as fire protection, tax law, education, and medical devices using the latest language models. We develop AI co-pilots for engineers, AI coaches for schoolchildren, and suggestion systems for technical writers. We draw on decades of experience in software development for German global leaders. We see the potential of the technology, are curious about the next developments, and proud of what we are building.</p><p>As a Full Stack AI Engineer, you ideally should have fun to:</p><ul><li>experiment with genAI, LLMs and different retrieval technologies</li><li>build suiting Frontends</li><li>build Backends that bridge the gap between Frontend and the ML parts.</li></ul><p>You will be working closely with other devs and our customers, with the possibility to actively influence the direction of the project and to introduce new technology or approaches.</p><p>Your project increment will always be working software that is really used and needed.</p><p>HereÂ´s the catch: our customers are mostly German, hence the data is primarily German and therefore the output of our LLM inferences is German.
