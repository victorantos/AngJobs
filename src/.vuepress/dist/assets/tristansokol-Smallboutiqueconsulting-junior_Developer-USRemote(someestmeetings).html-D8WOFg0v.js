I work with a small group of developers doing custom software development and consulting for small/medium businesses. We have enough work where it would be nice to have someone else in our team so we can maybe think about more clients. This is a great opportunity for SAHMs, new parents, etc. who want to get back into the workforce in a very flexible way and don&#39;t <em>need</em> a full time job, or people who are looking for some supplemental nights and weekend work or maybe transitioning into software development from a different career.</p><p>The work is very different by client, so we are always learning new domains, but not terribly difficult, so a year or two of development experience is a great level for us. Our technology stack is anchored in:</p><ul><li>JavaScript/Node/Vue</li><li>GCP/App Engine/Cloud Functions</li><li>Jira/Confluence/Google Workspace</li></ul><p>If this sounds interesting and a good fit your lifestyle, reach out to [the two letter acronym for this site]@cookie.bike</p><p>Have a great day!</p>",6),l=[r];function a(s,m){return o(),t("div",null,l)}const p=e(n,[["render",a],["__file","tristansokol-Smallboutiqueconsulting-junior_Developer-USRemote(someestmeetings).html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/March-2024/tristansokol-Smallboutiqueconsulting-junior_Developer-USRemote(someestmeetings).html","title":"Small boutique consulting : junior+ Developer","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Small boutique consulting : junior+ Developer","author":{"name":"tristansokol","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39564625"},"description":"Small boutique consulting - junior+ Developer - US Remote (some est meetings) - part-time/flexible/1099 - $$/hr Hi!
