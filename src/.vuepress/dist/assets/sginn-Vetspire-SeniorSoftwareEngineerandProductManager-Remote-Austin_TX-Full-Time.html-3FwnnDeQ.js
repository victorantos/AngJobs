We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.</p><p>We help your furry best friends live longer and healthier lives by helping their care-givers (veterinarians!) work better and happier—delighted and empowered by technology.</p><p>We&#39;re looking for a full stack engineer to join our small and technical team to continue to bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians&#39; needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend.</p><p>Some examples of what your weeks may look like:</p><ul><li><p>building remote tools for pet owners to sign consent forms, pay invoices, and fill in information online so they don&#39;t have to walk into the clinics during the pandemic</p></li><li><p>creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time</p></li><li><p>designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders.</p></li></ul><p>You&#39;ll be working directly with the thousands of veterinarians and staff using Vetspire every day, and talking with them often to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It&#39;s an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone&#39;s pets. It&#39;s half-part engineering, half-part problem-solving.</p><p>Our backend tech stack is a Phoenix application written in Elixir, our frontend is using React with the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.</p><p>We&#39;re also hiring for a Product Manager role! The PM Will be in charge of the overall Vetspire product, driving our roadmap, meeting with our users, and helping bring our vision into reality.</p><p>Email me if interested at sam@vetspire.com (include &quot;HN&quot; in the subject), or view more information here on open roles: <a href="https://wellfound.com/company/vetspire" rel="nofollow">https://wellfound.com/company/vetspire</a></p>',10),a=[o];function s(l,c){return n(),t("div",null,a)}const d=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","sginn-Vetspire-SeniorSoftwareEngineerandProductManager-Remote-Austin_TX-Full-Time.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/jobs/March-2024/sginn-Vetspire-SeniorSoftwareEngineerandProductManager-Remote-Austin_TX-Full-Time.html","title":"Vetspire : Senior Software Engineer and Product Manager","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Vetspire : Senior Software Engineer and Product Manager","author":{"name":"sginn","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39565619"},"description":"Vetspire - Senior Software Engineer and Product Manager - Remote - Austin, TX - Full-Time - https://vetspire.com Vetspire is an electronic health records and practice management...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://angjobs.com/jobs/March-2024/sginn-Vetspire-SeniorSoftwareEngineerandProductManager-Remote-Austin_TX-Full-Time.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"ANGJOBS"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Vetspire : Senior Software Engineer and Product Manager"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Vetspire - Senior Software Engineer and Product Manager - Remote - Austin, TX - Full-Time - https://vetspire.com Vetspire is an electronic health records and practice management..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"sginn"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Vetspire : Senior Software Engineer and Product Manager\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-07-01T16:55:04.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"sginn\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39565619\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1719322411000,"updatedTime":1719852904000,"contributors":[{"name":"Victor A","email":"victorantos@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.36,"words":408},"filePathRelative":"jobs/March-2024/sginn-Vetspire-SeniorSoftwareEngineerandProductManager-Remote-Austin_TX-Full-Time.md","localizedDate":"June 25, 2024","autoDesc":true}');export{d as comp,u as data};
