We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.</p><p>Healthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.</p><p>What’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets.</p><p>We’re changing that.</p><p>At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)</p><p>Our typical paid rate is above 95%.</p><p>We are a team of 25 with <em>strong</em> product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.</p><p>You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.</p><p>Email me at chris@juniperplatform.com</p>",10),a=[o];function s(p,c){return r(),t("div",null,a)}const u=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","tyre-Juniper(YCW21)-SeniorSoftwareEngineer-NYC-Full-time-juniperplatform_com.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/hn/February-2024/tyre-Juniper(YCW21)-SeniorSoftwareEngineer-NYC-Full-time-juniperplatform_com.html","title":"Juniper (YC W21) : Senior Software Engineer","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Juniper (YC W21) : Senior Software Engineer","author":{"name":"tyre","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39222807"},"description":"Juniper (YC W21) - Senior Software Engineer - NYC - Full-time - juniperplatform.com Juniper operates at the messy financial infrastructure layer for US Healthcare.
