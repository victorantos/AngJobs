It ingested sports video and identified predetermined highlights in baseball - diving catches in our case. The ML pipeline was a CNN model which fed into an RNN. Given a bunch of video clips of diving catches as training data, it could later identify those diving catches and automatically annotate the video feeds.</p><p>Who shouldn&#39;t contact me.</p><p>If your market is Ads or gambling I&#39;m not interested.
