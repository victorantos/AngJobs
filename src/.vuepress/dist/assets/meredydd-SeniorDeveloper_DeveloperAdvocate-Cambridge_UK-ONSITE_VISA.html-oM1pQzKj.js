Together, you can build and host a full-stack web application - and all you need is a little Python. (Yes, even the client-side code - we compile Python to JS and provide a GUI framework!)</p><hr><p><em>1. Senior Developer:</em></p><p>We’re looking for an experienced all-rounder to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on the back-end. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but we&#39;re looking for someone who isn&#39;t afraid to jump into something you haven&#39;t used before.</p><p>You’ll be working with other seriously good all-rounders, including the founders (relevant PhDs, kernel contributors, builders of backyard dancing fountains) and senior colleagues (eg: a former maths teacher who reverse-engineered our drag&#39;n&#39;drop editor just to build more UI components), as well as our other developers and developer advocates. We&#39;re bootstrapped and profitable, with a small, smart, friendly and diverse team.</p><p>Building dev tools is great! We&#39;re solving problems we&#39;ve experienced ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms have the most fun engineering problems.</p><hr><p><em>2. Developer Advocate:</em></p><p>We’re looking for a developer with great communication skills to show people how to build awesome things with Anvil, and to make Anvil better to use.</p><p>You’ll be writing how-to guides, blog posts and tutorials, building example apps, presenting Anvil at conferences, and helping our users – from individual developers to huge companies – build their web applications. You’ll then use what you’ve learned to help us make Anvil better to use. That might mean deciding what examples to build, or it might mean deciding that we need to redesign the first-run experience for the Anvil Editor – and then doing it.</p><p>It&#39;s rewarding work – developers love being introduced to Anvil (we get mobbed at conferences!). Plus, there are all the advantages of an early-stage startup: seriously smart colleagues, small team, lots of autonomy, and huge impact. (Did I mention we&#39;re diverse, friendly and supportive?)</p><hr><p>For full job descriptions, and to hear what it&#39;s like working here, go to <a href="https://anvil.works/jobs" rel="nofollow">https://anvil.works/jobs</a>.</p><p>We work hybrid (in the office Tue-Thu, wherever you like Mon/Fri).
