I&#39;ve previously worked in developer relations at Cloudant (YC S08), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11), and explored Ai/ML (computer vision for self-driving cars) before diving deep into crypto.</p><p>Our mission is making new crypto protocols and LLMs easy to discover and use on your mobile phone. Private by design.</p><p>We started with the idea of a privacy-first browser with built-in micropayments (via the Interledger Protocol) and have since added support for identity (HNS, ENS; Unstoppable Domains in testing) and storage (IPFS; Arweave in testing).</p><p>We just soft launched OpenAI and Anthropic integrations and looking into ways of running LLaMA-like open source models on device. Come help us prototype and build it.</p><p>We recently surpassed 750k downloads and are excited to grow our team. We’ve raised Angel and Seed venture rounds from some of the best builders in crypto and Ai: Protocol Labs, Hard Yaka, Shima Capital, Fenbushi, HashKey, Don Ho (Orange DAO, Quantstamp), Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake, Neeva, Greylock), Jason Warner (ex-GitHub CTO, VP Eng Heroku &amp; Canonical), Illia Polosukhin (NEAR Protocol) and many more.</p><p>• We value Optimism, Kindness, Curiosity, Speed and Grit.</p><p>• Two recurring weekly meetings to maximize state of flow: Monday all-hands, Friday Demos.</p><p>• Careful with growth and never had to do layoffs.</p><p>• Capital efficient with 3+ years of runway.</p><p>Open Roles: Ai/ML Engineer, iOS &amp; macOS Engineer, Browser Extension Engineer, Head of Memes &amp; Growth; Internships: Eng, Design, Growth</p><p>How to Apply: visit <em><a href="http://join.puma.gg" rel="nofollow">http://join.puma.gg</a></em> or email <em>careers+hn [at] pumabrowser.com</em></p><p>Thank you!</p>',13),n=[i];function s(p,m){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const u=e(a,[["render",s],["__file","html5cat-PumaBrowser-Remote-firstwithPSToverlap.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/hn/January-2024/html5cat-PumaBrowser-Remote-firstwithPSToverlap.html","title":"Puma Browser : Remote-first with PST overlap","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Puma Browser : Remote-first with PST overlap","author":{"name":"html5cat","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38848615"},"description":"Puma Browser - Remote-first with PST overlap - Engineering & Growth - $75-120k base & 200k+ equity - http://join.puma.gg Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma Browser.
