Freeform (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeform.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeform.co&#x2F;</a>) | Software Engineers (C++ &#x2F; Rust) | Full-time | Onsite | Los Angeles, CA

Our team recently secured a key partnership with NVIDIA’s inception program and have been diving into advanced hardware acceleration, leveraging high-speed vision systems alongside modern GPUs and FPGAs to power up our autonomous metal 3D printing factories at a global scale.

It&#x27;s a very exciting inflection point to get into the company at an early stage where we are at the cusp of securing multi-million-dollar annually recurring production opportunities with many of the top&#x2F;largest aerospace, automotive, industrial and semiconductor companies.

We are hiring C++ and Rust Engineers who want to get their hands on cutting-edge robotics applications.

It’s a small, tight-knit team and you’d have the opportunity to own significant and impactful greenfield projects throughout the entire development lifecycle and much more.

Our software team comes from the likes of Google, SpaceX, and Apple, and believe in taking a first principles approach to solving hard problems.
