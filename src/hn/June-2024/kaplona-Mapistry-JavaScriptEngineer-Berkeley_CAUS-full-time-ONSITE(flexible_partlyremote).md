We help manufacturing facilities to be compliant with the environmental regulations, reduce their emissions, and become better stewards of the Earth for generations to come.

We are searching for an intermediate&#x2F;senior full-stack engineer. You will work in a small team of talented developers, and be a part of decision making, starting from the user problems we are trying to solve, all the way through technical implementation, and UX design. Just a slice of technologies we use: Node, TypeScript, Postgres, Snowflake, React, React Native.

Mapistry is committed to work-life balance, it has flexible hours and vacation. The work never failed to provide me with plenty of opportunities to grow, and challenges to solve as environmental regulations can get quite complex depending on an industry or specific manufacturing processes. No worries there is a team of domain experts that is a delight to work with!
