Friendly Captcha - DevOps Engineer &amp; Integrations Engineer - REMOTE within EU - PART-TIME or FULL-TIME - Office in Munich, Germany - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;friendlycaptcha.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;friendlycaptcha.com</a>

At Friendly Captcha we do one thing and we do it well: we protect websites from malicious actors and bots.

We provide privacy-friendly and accessible anti-bot solutions that don’t annoy users with tasks like clicking fire hydrants. We make the internet a bit better every day by winning over customers currently using Google reCAPTCHA.

We’re a fast-growing, profitable, fully bootstrapped company. Our revenue mostly comes from medium to large European enterprise and governments.

We are currently hiring for two roles: a DevOps infra-focused Engineer, and a (polyglot) Integrations Engineer.

For the DevOps engineer a great fit would be a pragmatic builder who prefers to keep things simple (perhaps boring is the right word?). We prefer to design so that we don&#x27;t need a dedicated team to maintain any part. You should be productive in Go, and a good knowledge of modern DevOps&#x2F;SRE practices is expected (IaC, GitOps, etc...).

For the Integrations Engineer it&#x27;s perhaps less well defined. We think investing in a great developer experience through documentation, SDKs and plugins will pay dividends - and it makes sense for us to grow our team in that direction. The role involves helping us build integrations and plugins for various platforms, but also talking to customers to learn where we can improve. We think the right hire will shape the role themselves.

Our engineering team is remote across Europe, we meet up once per quarter or so. You can work either 4 or 5 days per week, remote or (partially) from our Munich office. Please note that we ONLY consider candidates located within the EU, EEA or UK.
