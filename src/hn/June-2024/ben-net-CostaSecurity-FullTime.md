Costa Security | Lead &#x2F; Senior Engineer | Chicago &#x2F; Bay Area Preference (Open to Remote) | Full Time

Hi everyone. We are Costa, and we are building the next generation of network security.

&gt;&gt; who we are

At Costa, we believe in a world where it is easy to share information with good actors, and easy to protect it from bad ones. And we need help from great people to get there.

Our founding team has gone from garage to IPO before. We have experience at big companies (Amazon&#x2F;Meta) and small. We are remote today, but have a preference for people near us (Bay Area&#x2F;Chicago). We may not be fully remote in the future. We are early in our journey. We are backed by some great VCs. Now is an exciting time to join.

&gt;&gt; what we do

We are building an infrastructure as code network security platform that runs everywhere. We help our customers easily move their compute between clouds, data centers, the edge by making networking and security understandable, repeatable and seamless.

Our first product gives network and security teams a single, seamless interface to deploy, configure and manage complex hybrid overlay networks and security services running within those networks.

&gt;&gt; seeking great people

We are hiring our first product engineers. We are built on a modern stack: Ruby&#x2F;Rails + StimulusJS, Golang, Python, Docker, Terraform, Packer and Wireguard. We are looking for backend, frontend and SRE&#x2F;Devops engineers. Ideally people are familiar with networking and security concepts. Help build our engineering culture, one that embraces mutual respect, shared responsibility and continuous curiosity, and prizes an intellectual honesty that fosters both confidence and humility.

- Lead Platform Engineer - Design and build the Costa Platform Control Plane (Rails+). The Control Plane is responsible for deploying, scaling and managing a distributed mesh of software defined networking (SDN) controllers

- Product Engineer - focus on dev &amp; client tools - build out our CLI in Golang, API SDKs etc.

- Devops Engineer - Build out our infra deployment automation and work with the lead platform engineer for the deployment functionality of our control plane

If you are interested in protecting information and want to be part of a dynamic team that enjoys working together to build something great, we invite you to apply.
