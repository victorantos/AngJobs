Polaron | Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer | London, UK | Full-time

Polaron is an Imperial College London spinout [1] using generative AI to transform the material design process. We’re leveraging machine learning to bridge the gap between process (how materials are made) and performance (how materials behave). For example, using our image-based generative AI technology, we designed a Li-ion battery cathode with a 10% increased power density compared to the original design.

We’re building a SaaS platform that enables materials designers to use state-of-the-art AI techniques in their day-to-day work. We’ve just closed our first round of Angel&#x2F;VC funding, and have just been announced as a finalist of the UK Government’s Manchester Prize [2].

We’re a small team with deep expertise in materials science and AI. We’re looking for software engineers excited about building early-stage tech products to join us in productising our world-leading research [3].

Some of the things on our roadmap you’ll work on include:
- Building a robust cloud platform for scheduling the training and serving of bespoke AI models for our customers.
- A rich web-based image manipulation application for pre-processing image data that is used to train ML models.

Tech Stack: TypeScript (React &#x2F; Next.js &#x2F;Express &#x2F; Prisma), Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform.
