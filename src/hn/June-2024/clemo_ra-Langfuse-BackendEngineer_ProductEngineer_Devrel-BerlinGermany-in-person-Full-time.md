Langfuse | Backend Engineer, Product Engineer, Devrel | Berlin Germany | in-person | Full-time

I&#x27;m Clemens, co-founder of Langfuse (YC W23) - we&#x27;re building open source LLMOps dev tooling (Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;</a>). We started with observability and have branched out into more workflows over time (evals, prompt mgmt, playground, testing...). 
We have a bunch of traction and are looking for our third to fifth hire in scaling and building feature depth. We&#x27;re hiring in person (4-5 days&#x2F;week) in Berlin, Germany (salary ranges for each job 70k-130k, up to 0.75% equity).

If you&#x27;d love shipping in open source, writing about what you work on and working hard with super interesting and sophisticated customers (devs) - reach out!

We&#x27;re particularly looking for a backend engineer that can help with Clickhouse and scaling our platform to serve thousands of companies and hundreds of millions of ingested events&#x2F;day.
