Puma.tech | Remote-first with PST overlap | Engineering &amp; Growth | $75-150k base &amp; 200k+ equity | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech</a>

Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma.tech. Previously worked  as software engineer &amp; developer advocate at Cloudant (YC S08, Acq. by IBM), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11, Acq. by Meta), and explored Ai&#x2F;ML (computer vision for self-driving cars) before diving deep into crypto.

<i>Puma Browser</i> is focused on making LLMs easy to use on your mobile phone. Private by design.

Here’s a quick demo we posted this weekend: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;PumaBrowser&#x2F;status&#x2F;1797072415388033393" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;PumaBrowser&#x2F;status&#x2F;1797072415388033393</a>

We’ve raised Angel and Pre-Seed Rounds from some of the best builders in crypto and Ai: Illia Polosukhin (NEAR Protocol), Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake CEO, Neeva, Greylock), Jason Warner (ex-GitHub CTO), Chris Larsen (founder of Ripple), Don Ho (Orange DAO, Quantstamp), Protocol Labs, Shima, SBI, Fenbushi, HashKey and more.

- We value Optimism, Kindness, Curiosity, Speed and Grit.

- Only two recurring weekly meetings to maximize state of flow: Monday all-hands, Friday Demos.

- Careful with growth and never had to do layoffs.

- Capital efficient with 3+ years of runway.

Open Roles: Eng (iOS, Android, Ai&#x2F;ML, Browser Extensions), Head of Memes &amp; Growth; Internships: Eng, Design, Growth
