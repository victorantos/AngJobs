PlantingSpace | Full-time | Remote (EU time zone) with quarterly gatherings | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planting.space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planting.space</a>

We are building an AI system that can accurately represent knowledge and handle uncertainty, to enable the discovery of insights and solve problems based on explainable reasoning. Our technology is not based on a GPT framework but on a novel approach to structured knowledge representation. We envision applications to automate analysis and speed up research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more.

We are continuously looking for strong software engineers who are up for a challenge and a steep learning curve. You’ll be exposed to cutting edge research in Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems, information theory, symbolic computing, and more.

Current openings at PlantingSpace:

- Senior NLP Engineer: build bridges between neural and symbolic representations within our system.

- Software Engineer: contributing to core system development, production backend engineering, implementing and analysing algorithms.

- Applied Category Theorist (Knowledge Representation): research category theoretic representations of real world phenomena to inspire our development.
