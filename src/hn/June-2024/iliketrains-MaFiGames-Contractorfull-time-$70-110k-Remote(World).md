MaFi Games | Senior SWE&#x2F;game dev | Contract or full-time | $70-110k | Remote (World) | C#

I’m the co-founder of MaFi Games – an indie studio behind the game Captain of Industry. We are a small but passionate team who gave up their jobs at Google&#x2F;Nvidia to pursue building the best factory simulation game possible, and we need more hands!

We are looking for an experienced software engineer or game developer to grow the team and accelerate our progress. We are also looking for part-time UI&#x2F;UX designers.

Some reasons you’d enjoy working with us:

* A multicultural, collaborative, and innovative work environment where your voice is heard.

* Fully remote job with flexible working hours and vacation schedule.

* High quality C# code base, code reviews, tests.

* High work satisfaction, work on a popular video game with a wonderful community.

* No bureaucracy, no politics, no perf, 1 regular meeting per week.
