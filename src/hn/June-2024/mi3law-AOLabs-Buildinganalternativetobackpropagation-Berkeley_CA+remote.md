AO Labs | Building an alternative to backpropagation | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aolabs.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aolabs.ai&#x2F;</a> | Berkeley, CA + remote

AI systems struggle with edge cases and understanding local context despite increasing model sizes. From our research at UC Berkeley into the evolution of intelligence from simple organisms, weâ€™ve discovered the missing link is continuous learning (deep learning is pre-trained by design). Models built with our framework learn through customizable parameters similar to animal instincts, allowing for AI grounded with built-in memory and reasoning. We&#x27;re a community of 160+ developers and researchers building general intelligence from the bottom-up from places like Berkeley, NYU, Imperial College, and Google.

We&#x27;re building way outside of the current paradigm and we&#x27;re looking for collaborators at all levels --hackers, contributors, the curious-- as we&#x27;ll be making our first hires soon. Reach out: ali at aolabs.ai
