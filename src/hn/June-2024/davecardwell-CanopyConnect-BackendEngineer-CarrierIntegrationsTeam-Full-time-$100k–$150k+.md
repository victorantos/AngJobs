Canopy Connect | Backend Engineer - Carrier Integrations Team | Full-time | REMOTE (US &amp; Canada) | $100k–$150k+ | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usecanopy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usecanopy.com&#x2F;</a>

We’re building “Plaid for insurance”—a single-click solution for insurance data sharing.

We serve over 4,000 companies (and growing rapidly!) including insurance agencies, lenders, insurtechs, fintechs, and insurance carriers to streamline acquiring verified insurance data from consumers and businesses.

We&#x27;re hiring engineers for our Carrier Integrations team. We&#x27;re a small, fully remote team based in the US and Canada. We present the best of both worlds - a nimble startup and small team (low strike price on equity and more ownership&#x2F;impact), yet derisked because of our capital efficiency.
