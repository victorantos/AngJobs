Cobalt helps secure leading companies (e.g. Dropbox, PagerDuty) by connecting them with on-demand pentesting experts. Our application brings both sides together to identify, triage and fix vulnerabilities. Ten years in and over 30K commits later, our technology has been battle tested by thousands of users and we’re still having fun. We’re a team of can-do people who care about craft, collaboration, and our customers.

If you enjoy making an impact, the Cobalt Engineering team is excited to hear from you. We are hiring for multiple roles. All applicants will need to be permitted to work in Germany &gt;&gt;
