Monad Labs | NYC, Hybrid 3-days On-Site

Monad Labs just raised $225M in series A funding to scale our team in bringing the Monad blockchain to production this year.

Founded by Jump Trading alums, Monad Labs is a tech startup using low-latency programming, compiler optimization, and multithreaded computing to build an ultra-high-performance smart contract platform. The work entails building an optimal stack-based VM that supports multithreaded computation, as well as developing and implementing an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm enabling a network of nodes to come to consensus.

We are hiring, blockchain experience not required.
