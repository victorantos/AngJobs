We&#x27;re hiring a founding backend engineer to help us build infrastructure to run web agents at scale.

We&#x27;re a super small scrappy team of four that&#x27;s been working on the application layer of web agents since it&#x27;s inception. Our projects have over 30k stars on GitHub, we&#x27;re backed by PG himself + a bunch of great investors, and we have 3+ years of runway. Join us if you want to grind, want a lot of ownership, and are experienced. (More info about the role in our job posting)

You can either apply through bookface (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;reworkd&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4f6BHpT-founding-engineer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;reworkd&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4f6BHpT-f...</a>) or directly email me the following (asim@reworkd.ai) the following:
