Prophet Town | Full-Stack Engineer | REMOTE (USA-preferred) | Part-time or Full-time (20-40 hours&#x2F;week) | $60-$110&#x2F;hr | English fluency required

I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a small, fully-remote, sf-bay-area-based, boutique indie tech agency, with significant flexibility on hours, projects, and location.  Our leadership staff are all ex-Fortune100; everybody codes.  One-half 9-5 engineering; one-half freelancing: freedom, without solo practice risk.  Startup&#x2F;entrepreneur mindset preferred.

Tech stacks and needs are diverse; our motto is “interesting work for interesting workers”.  Notable recent projects: auction.voltagepark.com, a slackbot for Anduril’s employees, app.pokercows.com.  Polyglot and many-hats preferred.  We are currently filling “Tier 3” ($60-70&#x2F;hr, 5-10 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e) and &quot;Tier 4&quot; ($90-$110, 7-20 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e) roles, a little more focused on frontend (NextJS&#x2F;React&#x2F;Remix&#x2F;React-Native), but backend (Node&#x2F;Express&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Django&#x2F;SQL) and cloud infra+devops (Kubernetes&#x2F;Docker, AWS&#x2F;GCP service set, common CI&#x2F;CD options) also needed.
