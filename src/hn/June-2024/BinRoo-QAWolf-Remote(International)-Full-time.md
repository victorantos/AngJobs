QA Wolf gets engineering teams to 80% automated E2E coverage fast, and keeps it there.

We are growing quickly  and building the dream team of engineers to develop our test creation, running, and maintenance platform. The stack is Node.js, GraphQL, React, Prisma, Go, and Kubernetes.

We are looking for a master of AI engineering who stays familiar with the latest best practices and knows the trade-offs of different patterns.

You will own problems end-to-end: collect relevant details, spec and scope solution(s), communicate progress, ship and own the results.

You:

- love coding and want to work hard

- are a self-starter, curious, and ship projects undirected

- have a proven track record of delivering challenging technical projects

- have an eye for design and can make good judgement calls with ambiguity

- are an expert in one or more technical areas

- have meaningful contributions to open source projects
