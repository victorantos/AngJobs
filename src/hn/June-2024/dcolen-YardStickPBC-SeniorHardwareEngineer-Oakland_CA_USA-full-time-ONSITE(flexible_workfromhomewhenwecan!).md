We&#x27;re working to measure soil carbon accurately, instantly, and affordably using spectroscopy on a handheld probe.

We&#x27;re looking for a hardware engineer with a proven track record of shipping hardware that works, that can design reliable electronic systems, integrate weird sensors, write the firmware to tie it altogether, and loves diving into the plethora of data that comes from the field. Let me know if you&#x27;re interested or know anyone who is!

I am the hiring manager and one of three other engineers working on the hardware. Let me know if you have any questions!

Apply to the role here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;yardstick&#x2F;c425b542-cef1-4bc3-acb3-49447707dbf2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;yardstick&#x2F;c425b542-cef1-4bc3-acb3-4944...</a>
