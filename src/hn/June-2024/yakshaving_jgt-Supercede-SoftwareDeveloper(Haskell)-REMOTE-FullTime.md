Supercede | Software Developer (Haskell) | REMOTE | Full Time

Supercede builds industry-leading risk placement and analytics software for the reinsurance industry. We&#x27;re all-in on functional programming, and we&#x27;re looking for more help.

Our tech stack is predominantly:

- Haskell (Yesod, Conduit, Persistent&#x2F;Esqueleto, HSpec&#x2F;QuickCheck, Shakespeare, Aeson)

- Nix

- PostgreSQL

- HTML, CSS, and [minimal] JavaScript

You must have demonstrable experience building things in idiomatic Haskell, and you should have a solid understanding of how web applications typically work. You should be able to communicate clearly in English, but you do not need to speak English natively. You&#x27;ll have flexible working hours and you can work from anywhere, though this is a full-time position and the expectation is that of work based on a traditional 40 hour week, with 25 days of paid annual holiday in addition to your country&#x27;s national holidays.

We favour asynchronous communication, and try to hire &quot;managers of one&quot;. We don&#x27;t do daily stand-ups. We don&#x27;t count your hours. We don&#x27;t work weekends. We support each other in working and learning, and we have 20% time where programmers are able to work on open source and&#x2F;or research projects. We value colleagues who are kind, diligent, and tenacious.

Are you a good fit? Please write me a brief email introducing yourself with your résumé attached to jezen@supercede.com.
