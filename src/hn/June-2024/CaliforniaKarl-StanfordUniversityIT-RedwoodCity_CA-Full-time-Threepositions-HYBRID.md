Stanford University IT - Redwood City, CA - Full-time - Three positions - HYBRID

Stanford University IT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uit.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uit.stanford.edu</a>) provides a large number of IT-related services, from desktop support, to networking, to analog &amp; VoIP telephone, Kerberos, LDAP, AD, RADIUS, O365 &amp; Google &amp; Zoom, email, cloud, and more!

Within UIT, Middleware &amp; Integration Services (MaIS) runs the Registries.  Many central &amp; distributed IT systems are fed by the Registries, which take information from disparate sources, and combine them into single views of Organizations, People, Accounts, Courses, Groups, etc..  MaIS provides XML &amp; JSON APIs to interact with the Registries, as well as feeding information into LDAP.  They also implement business logic, mapping student and employee careers into account &amp; service lifetimes, group memberships, and more.

MaIS apps are almost exclusively Java (using Spring).  Tomcat and the Oracle Application Express (Apex) platforms are used as middlewares.  The database is, of course, Oracle (with PL&#x2F;SQL).  Knowing any of the following would be a plus: HTML5, JQuery, shell scripting, and SnapLogic.

MaIS are looking for three people:

• IT Software Developer: You&#x27;ll be working on existing Registry code, fixing bugs, and implementing enhancements.  More information: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD28zQlx" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD28zQlx</a>

• IT Software Developer (Oracle APEX): This is the same as the above position, but is focused more on our webapps than on our backend code.  More information: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDvMXQlz" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDvMXQlz</a>

• IT Systems Analyst: This is similar to the IT Software Developer, but you&#x27;ll be spending more time talking with clients within the University, understanding their requirements, and coming up with solutions.  More information: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDw5aQm0" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDw5aQm0</a>

If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site (except in Menlo Park). There is some on-call around the holidays. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation). All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards</a>.

If you have questions, feel free to reply here or email me (the info is in my profile)!
