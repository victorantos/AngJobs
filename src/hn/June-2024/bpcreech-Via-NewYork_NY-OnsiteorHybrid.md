Via | New York, NY | Onsite or Hybrid

At Via (ridewithvia.com), we are improving mobility in cities all over the world. Our software and people coordinate everything from on-demand microtransit to paratransit to shuttles to school buses, with &gt;750 partners in 50 countries with 130m rides served so far. We pride ourselves on being a true partner to the public sector in helping make transit better for everyone, especially those in low income and minority communities.

Via is experiencing rapid growth, and as our user base expands, so we are expanding our engineering team. We are creating an engineering organization here in NYC, and are looking for experienced tech leads and engineering managers to help us build our team! Our backend tech stack today is Python, AWS, K8s, Lambda, Cloudflare, Terraform, Gitlab, and more.
