Tandem Health | Software Engineers | On-site in Stockholm, Sweden | Full time

The aging western population means we soon won’t be able to afford our current health care standards. Some 40% of the cost comes from administration. Much of this can be automated with LLMs + great software.

At Tandem we build products that allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, already at $300k ARR (+35% MoM). With our target set at the ginormous European healthcare market.

Why work at Tandem:

1. Ship features that actually matter.

2. Deliver value to users right now, not in some promised future.

3. Join a tight knit team on a mission to change European healthcare.

We’ve recently raised a large seed round and are expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers!
