Resleeve | Remote | Netherlands +- 9 hours | Full-time internships

Resleeve is a startup that seeks to transform how fashion designers develop their next fashion item and get a photoshoot from that item. Instead of going through multiple drafts, creating a dummy, hiring a photographer and model, all can now be achieved through Resleeve Studio. We were founded 2 years ago and pivoted in September.

If you are in your last year of university or recently graduated and you want to build some hands-on experience with generative models, then this could be a great internship experience.

We will provide you with an environment where you will work with the CEO and the CTO (me, ex-MLE leader at Bain &amp; Co and BCG who deployed ML at big scale) to develop new features for our studio and work with our end-users to address their business needs. We also invest a lot of coaching and mentoring into our interns to help you become a full-time employee with stock options!
