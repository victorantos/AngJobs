Konvu | Engineering | Paris, France | ONSITE | Full-time

At Konvu, we’re on a mission to make security invisible. As we move towards a future dominated by code automatically generated, tested, and deployed by AIs, we need a new paradigm for application security. We need vulnerabilities to be automatically detected, prioritized, and remediated.

Behind Konvu are founders with deep roots in the security industry. As early employees at Sqreen (YCW18), a notable security startup acquired by Datadog, we have firsthand experience in driving security solutions from concept to global impact.

We’re looking for:

- Java Instrumentation Specialist

- AI Software Engineer

- Software Engineer
