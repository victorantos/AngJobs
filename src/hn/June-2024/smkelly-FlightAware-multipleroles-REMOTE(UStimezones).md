Hello from FlightAware! We are hiring for a few positions, including Engineering Managers and Senior Software Engineers. Our team is headquartered in Houston, Texas, but we work as a distributed team and accept remote applicants for work within the United States.

FlightAware has built the world’s leading aviation software platform, processing over 180 million incoming messages an hour from over 30,000 feeds—over 2TB a day and growing—to provide the best, most complete, and most accurate real-time flight tracking services in the industry. We use Python, Rust, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript. We are proud to have built a wide variety of successful products on this foundation that have become central to the aviation industry at large.
