The global supply chain has a collaboration problem. It&#x27;s a mess of TMSs, ERPs, WhatsApp, emails, and spreadsheets. For the last 50 years, it&#x27;s been solved with brittle EDI integrations to bridge walled gardens. We&#x27;re taking a different approach. We aim to reshape how the supply chain collaborates and as a result redefine how trillions of dollars of goods get moved around the world.

We’re a small product team who have worked on anything from foundational technology at Flexport, self-driving cars, to core AI experiences and products at Google. We’re looking to bring a high level of craft to an industry that runs on incredibly outdated software.
