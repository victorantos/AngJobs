Stealth | Founding Full-Stack or Back-End AI Engineer | REMOTE or SF | Full-Time

Hey all - we&#x27;re a stealth startup founded by a serial entrepreneur with a successful exit &amp; raised a seed round from top Silicon Valley VCs. We&#x27;re on a mission to fix healthcare staffing shortages with AI.

We&#x27;re looking for a superbuilder who&#x27;s comfortable getting things done across the whole tech stack, with an emphasis on backend. Knowledge of Python, production environments and containers is a must, Node&#x2F;NestJS is desired. Practical experience with developing AI native apps leveraging ChatGPT, Claude or other LLMs is preferred.

As a founding engineer, you&#x27;d be getting 1-2% equity.

We use Python, NestJS, React, NextJS, Typescript, Kubernetes, Airflow and advanced machine learning systems in our stack.
