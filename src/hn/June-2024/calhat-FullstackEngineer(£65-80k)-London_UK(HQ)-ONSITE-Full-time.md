Our aim is to make counselling and therapy free at the point of use for as many people as possible. We do this by selling a mental health support product to businesses.

We&#x27;re a small product-focused company, we don&#x27;t employ any salespeople, and we are cashflow positive.

We&#x27;re hiring a Mid-Level Fullstack Engineer into our product and engineering team of 8.
