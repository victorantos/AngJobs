Etherdata.io - Cleveland, OH - REMOTE - Full-time

Senior Software Engineer (Elixir)

Etherdata is looking for a talented senior software engineer with a minimum of 4 years of experience in Elixir. Phoenix, LiveView, TypeScript, and Kubernetes are our main stack, so familiarity with these is also required. Rust is a plus.

We are a small team, currently consisting of only one developer. This position is for someone who will work closely with the team and be responsible for defining various implementation aspects of the system.

We provide business intelligence for the agro-industry, and with a recent rapid growth, many things are changing and&#x2F;or are still in their early days. So there will be a fair share of architecting and DevOps (mainly Kubernetes) involved.
