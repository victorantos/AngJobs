Doublepoint | Helsinki &#x2F; Remote | Multiple roles | Full-time

We&#x27;re creating cutting edge gesture detection algorithms for smartwatches.

Our goal is to solve the AR interaction problem, with our first product being an algorithm designed for smartwatch sensors which can detect subtle microgestures of a user&#x27;s fingertip at an extremely high accuracy and robustness. This algorithm is so efficient that it removes an AR headset&#x27;s reliance on camera-based hand tracking, making all-day lightweight headsets of science fiction finally a reality.

We also recently launched WowMouse[1], an app for smartwatches that lets you control devices like computers and tablets with your hand rather than a mouse (over Bluetooth).

Open roles:

- Lead Machine Learning Engineer
- Technical Program Manager
