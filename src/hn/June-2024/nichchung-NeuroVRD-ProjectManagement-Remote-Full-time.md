NeuroVRD | Project Management | Remote | Full-time

Neurovascular Research and Design (NeuroVRD) is developing an AI surgical monitoring platform (Sentinel AI-IOM) that automatically and continuously monitors the functional integrity of neurovascular structures that are at surgical risk during high-risk surgery, helping surgeons improve surgical outcomes and maintaining the patient&#x27;s quality of life. Our transformative approach to intraoperative monitoring will increase access and availability, improve reliability, and significantly reduce costs.

We are seeking a skilled and experienced Project Manager to lead the development and commercialization of software&#x2F;hardware accessories and third party integrations to the Sentinel AI-IOM platform. The Project Manager will be responsible for overseeing entire project lifecycles, including clinical validation, FDA submission, QA processes, and supply chain development. This role requires excellent communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills to ensure project success.
