Jobber | Multiple Roles | REMOTE (Canada only) | Full time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobber.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobber.com</a>

Stack: Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, React+Remix, React Native

Jobber exists to serve small business entrepreneurs offering in-home services (think lawn care, cleaning, HVAC, roofers, etc). We’re an ambitious series D scale-up (750+ and growing). We’re looking for passionate engineers, managers and designers located in (and eligible to work in) Canada.  We care about craft, and we care about shipping. Whatever your role, you’ll report to someone who knows the field and is focused on being an effective leader (and those who want to stay technical aren&#x27;t career-blocked).  We’re fully remote across Canada, but with optional office spaces available in Edmonton and Toronto, and occasional optional coworking days and in-person social events in many other cities. While growing fast, we’re also scaling with intention and have not had to perform any workforce reductions.

Right now, we’re hiring for:

Engineering: Senior Software Engineers, Staff Software Engineers, Site Reliability Engineer, Engineering Manager

Design: Senior Product Designers, Staff Product Designer

Data: Senior Business Intelligence Engineers, Senior ML Ops Engineers
