Exa | San Francisco | In person | Full time | $130K-180K

Jeff, cofounder of Exa here. LLMs represent a brand new opportunity to organize humanity&#x27;s knowledge, in a way that hasn&#x27;t been done before. We&#x27;re an AI research lab focused on AI-powered search algorithms (using embeddings), currently applied to vast swaths of the web (we make our money as a search API).

We&#x27;re hiring pretty broadly across engineering - AI research, high performance Rust (e.g., we build an in-house vector DB), and full stack. If the mission of organizing the Internet motivates you, it&#x27;s a good fit :)
