Nooks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nooks.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nooks.ai</a>) | Software Engineers (full-stack &amp; backend&#x2F;applied ML) | Full-time | Onsite in SF (hybrid)

Hi, I’m one of the founders of Nooks — we’re trying to re-invent how sales teams work with real-time collaboration and AI.

Nooks is: - A virtual office: you can work from anywhere in the world, but still work with your team and get feedback and coaching like you’re sitting side-by-side. - and an AI co-pilot. We learn how your team works, identify “winning” strategies and behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!

We’re working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms &amp; infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You&#x27;ll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)

Right now we’re a small eng team (~12 ppl) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $4M ARR!

Looking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers. Excitement about language models, few-shot learning and other recent AI advances is also a plus :)
