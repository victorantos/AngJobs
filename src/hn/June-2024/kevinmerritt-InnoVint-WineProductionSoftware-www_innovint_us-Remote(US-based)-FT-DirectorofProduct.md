InnoVint | Wine Production Software | www.innovint.us | Remote (US-based) | FT | Director of Product

As InnoVint’s Director of Product, you’ll ensure the company uses leading-edge product design principles to create products our customers will love for decades. You’ll help the InnoVint platform grow into a multi-product suite of applications, some of which are yet to be built.

Reporting to the CTO, this key role has broad impact and works closely with all teams. You’ll be a high-level strategist who’s involved in product strategy, roadmap definition, packaging, pricing, and marketing for existing and new products. Within the Product team, you will actively contribute to our success at mapping complex winery operations and financial workflows into elegant and easy-to-use software. You’ll join a knowledgeable team with 10 years of experience building our complex application, eager to improve with your help and guidance.

InnoVint is the world&#x27;s leading SaaS solution for wineries and wine producers. We are and have always been a well-performing, tight-knit distributed&#x2F;virtual team that meets several times a year in the real world (usually a wine destination!). About half the team has some wine production experience. If you love the idea of being part of the wine industry but haven&#x27;t yet considered combining your experience in SaaS and tech, maybe InnoVint is the perfect company for you. If you are a reformed or aspiring winemaker, that&#x27;s even better!

This is a great opportunity to work with a fast-growing team, serving a really fun and interesting market - commercial wineries. If you&#x27;re interested in a more concrete visual understanding of InnoVint&#x27;s market-leading wine production software, here&#x27;s a short video showing the software in action: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hNBBZz08DWY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hNBBZz08DWY</a>
