The New York Times - Graphics&#x2F;Multimedia Editor — Applied Technology - $111k-$155k - Full-time - New York City

The Graphics department at The New York Times is looking for an expert in technologies like computer vision, machine learning and cloud-based data analysis to engineer new approaches for reporting and storytelling. You will work with designers, developers, cartographers, reporters and editors to unearth new stories that are not possible with traditional reporting methods and to create new tools for visual and data storytelling.

Your work will help the department produce new and creative approaches to visual journalism, and will enhance the team’s workflows and tooling used to report and create stories. You will pursue both proven and novel engineering methods to find storytelling solutions and will make journalistic and visual decisions to ensure the highest levels of accuracy and clarity in your work.

This technologist’s work will integrate a range of reporting and engineering methods and disciplines (examples listed in the responsibilities section below.) Your primary charge will be to anticipate and respond to news events and patterns in our news coverage through computational solutions and original software. You will keep up with emerging technologies and methods, and bring that knowledge to bear on the department’s coverage.
