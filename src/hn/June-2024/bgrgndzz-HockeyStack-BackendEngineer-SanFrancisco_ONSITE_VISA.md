HockeyStack | Backend Engineer | San Francisco, ONSITE, VISA

HockeyStack is creating a single source of truth and reporting for marketing, sales, and all customer data.

We came out of YC S23, and raised $4.3M from General Catalyst, Madrona, et al.

We grew from 0 to multi millions in annual revenue within a little over a year, profitably.

You will work on difficult problems in ingesting, storing, transforming, and reporting on billions of rows of data.

Examples:
- Finding patterns in what closes a deal using machine learning
- Scaling the infra every other month to handle the load
- Creating a dynamic SQL engine that takes input from a couple of dropdowns to replicate all BI functionality that revenue teams want
- Maintaining reliability in tens of integrations that ingest full CRM databases and building new ones

We have been doing this with a small but mighty team consisting of early startup engineers and founding CTOs (including one who founded a $900m company).

We have an intense culture -- we like to win, and win we do.

If you are exceptional at what you do, and you want to pour your heart out to build the largest enterprise software company in the world, please reach out at
