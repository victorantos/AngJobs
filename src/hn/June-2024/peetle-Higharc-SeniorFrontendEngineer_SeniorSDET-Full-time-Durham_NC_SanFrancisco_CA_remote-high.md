Higharc has built a cloud platform for homebuilders (build &gt;80% of homes built in the US every year) that massively reduces the burden of producing construction documents, material counts, and sales tools. At the center of the platform is an in-browser CAD system that allows builders to model homes with the information needed to support the complexity of their business. We raised a $53 million series B in 2023.
