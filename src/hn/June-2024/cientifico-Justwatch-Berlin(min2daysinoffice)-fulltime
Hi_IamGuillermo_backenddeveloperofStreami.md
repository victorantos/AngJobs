Justwatch  - Golang eng (Junior&#x2F;Senior) and Senior ML engineer - Berlin (min 2days in office) - full time
Hi. I am Guillermo, backend developer of StreamingGuide. We try to make justwatch.com the best streaming guide worldwide.

We predominantly utilize Golang and Kubernetes, interfacing with GRPC APIs from teams such as Content (housing &quot;the&quot; database) and Martech (for ad display). Additionally, we work with databases like Scylla and Elasticsearch, ensuring seamless operation even under high loads exceeding 5k requests per second.

We&#x27;re tackling challenges like integrating video ads, fortifying against scraping, enhancing response times, and optimizing the click-through rate for our recommender engine.

My colleagues from the content team, are also looking for a ML expert that help us finding the right recommendations.
