Continua AI | ML and Systems Engineers | NYC, SF Bay Area, Seattle | <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai</a>

Continua was founded in April 2023 by a Distinguished Engineer from Google Research to give everyone in the world an agent that uses their real-time context and personal memory to deliver actionable and timely assistance.
Our MVP is currently rolling out to select users, and we’re immensely excited by the feedback we’re getting - they’re finding that the Continua agent helps them in all manner of surprisingly useful ways.

This is an opportunity to be a part of setting the product and technical direction of this early stage company! ML engineers at Continua work on new approaches for knowledge representation, multimodality, and personalization under computational resource constraints. Systems engineers at Continua work on a wide variety of secure and reliable backend services and data pipelines to power our products.

We’re backed by tier-1 VCs, and we’ve already assembled a team of seven engineers with backgrounds at Google, Slack, CourseHero, and Amazon. We have a limited number of additional spots available on the team for engineers who are excited about building innovative products that leverage the latest advances in ML, including Transformers &#x2F; Mamba, RLHF, LoRA&#x2F;QLoRA, at-edge (on-device) training and inference, privacy-first ML, and more. If that sounds like you, we would love to hear from you.

If you are passionate about building innovative new products, and you’re eager to work in a dynamic startup environment, we would love to hear from you.
