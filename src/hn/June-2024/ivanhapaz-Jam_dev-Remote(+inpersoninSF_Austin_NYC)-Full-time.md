Jam.dev | Staff Fullstack Engineer &amp; AI Product Engineer | Typescript&#x2F;React | Remote (+ in person in SF, Austin, NYC) | Full-time

Dev tools company with 100,000+ users in less than 2 years. $10M in funding from Vercel CEO, GitHub CTO, Cloudflare CEO, etc.

We’re building a flight recorder for web apps – so anyone can report issues to engineers in a way that&#x27;s actually debuggable (w&#x2F; console, network, websockets debugger, etc).

Small, senior team – several ex-engineering directors turned ICs (mostly ex-early Cloudflare). Looking for staff-level engineers with experience building highly performant front-end apps.

Stack: React&#x2F;Typescript and MobX (MST) on the frontend, and Node&#x2F;GraphQL across our backend.

The challenge ahead: Scaling. Usage 10x’ed last year, and our users are in 150+ countries, on all sorts of devices, network conditions, etc. Our bar for quality is high.

As a dev tool, developers at Jam are directly connected and involved with the product. Your usage of the product will directly inform the direction of Jam’s future.
