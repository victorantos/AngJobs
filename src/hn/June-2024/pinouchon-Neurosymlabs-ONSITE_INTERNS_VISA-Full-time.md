Neurosym labs - Zurich (maybe NY&#x2F;Boston, maybe SF&#x2F;Bay area) - ONSITE, INTERNS, VISA - Full-time

I am considering starting an AI&#x2F;ML research company in the field of neurosymbolic programming (which sits at the intersection of deep learning, program synthesis and probabilistic programming). The goal is to be 100% focused on producing research that is made publicly available, guided by intellectual curiosity and a desire to move the field forward.

I am looking for co-founders or early employees. Although there is an existing company &amp; office that will be ready by the end of summer, not all details are figured out yet. The location is 80% likely to be Zurich (keeping the current office), but could be in the US. The funding is privately secured by other ML-related ventures I was involved with in the past. The name is also a placeholder name and will change. I can give more details privately.

Roles and compensation:

<pre><code>  - Full-time employees: base of around 100-250k USD&#x2F;annum + equity with standard vesting (negotiable).
  - Interns or residency program: base of around 80-180k USD&#x2F;annum
</code></pre>
(Other research interests: self-play, world models, common sense reasoning, program induction, causality, bayesian inference)

To apply, send me an email to b.crouzier at gmail and including &quot;Neurosym labs application&quot; in the title. Please reach out also if you just have pointers or other things you want to discuss, as I&#x27;m still exploring all options available.
