Summary:
My name is Joe and I&#x27;m the CTO of Steg AI. We are a venture backed startup that builds AI for invisible watermarking of digital media. I&#x27;m hiring a Senior Full Stack SWE. Our stack is javascript+React on the FE, python on the BE, with an AWS infrastructure.

We are based in Irvine, CA and have an office. This is an in-person role (with some flexibility). We go in most days because it&#x27;s way more fun working on the future around other highly motivated, smart people. We pay for relocation.

This role requires US citizenship or green card status. Email me at careers@steg.ai with your CV to apply.
