Tome revolutionizes contract understanding using AI coupled with expert domain knowledge. We decode complex contracts into simple reports, so users can understand their rights and make informed decisions. We are a team of 8, with a 4.5 person engineering team, backed by top VC firms, and we&#x27;re poised to transform the $400B legal industry.

*Role*: Join us as a Senior Frontend&#x2F;Full Stack Engineer to build out our customer facing UI as well as our suite of internal tools for labeling contracts, writing prompts, viewing prompt performance, working with our custom expression language, and the usual et cetera. Lots of room for experimenting on best approaches to graph based interfaces and complex data visualizations.

*Ideal Candidate:*

- Has worked in a startup, or independently led projects
- 5+ years of frontend development experience
- Experience with complex data visualizations
- Bonus points if you like writing full end-to-end tests, improving CI pipelines, or implementing pretty color gradients.

*Tech Stack:*

*Benefits:*

- Early-stage startup growth opportunities
- Competitive pay and comprehensive benefits
- Periodic on-sites (often including board gaming [presuming you view that as a benefit])
- Home office stipend
- Use of the company jet* (*when acquired)

We are committed to diversity and encourage applications from underrepresented groups.
