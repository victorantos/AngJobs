Finale Inventory - Senior Software Engineer - REMOTE - Full-Time

Finale Inventory is a SaaS application that helps ecommerce sellers manage their operations efficiently. We integrate with over 25 other systems (Amazon, eBay, Shopify, QuickBooks, etc.) to give our customers a complete picture of their business.

Weâ€™re a remote-first fully bootstrapped company that has built a thriving business grounded on long term relationships with our customers and employees.

Our culture is focused on delighting our customers, honesty, transparency, learning and innovating with our colleagues and customers, and constant improvement.

You&#x27;ll be joining a team of 15 engineers spread across North America, South America, and Western Europe. We use continuous deployment practices to ship code to production several times per day and have a strong test driven development approach. Our technology stack is predominantly JavaScript (Node.js, React) with C++ used in select places for performance.

Interested? Contact Chris Hondl, CTO&#x2F;Co-founder, chris@finaleinventory.com. I am leading the interview process which will include coding interviews and phone interviews with the co-founders and other engineers.
