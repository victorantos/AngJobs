We care about design. We fundamentally believe that great design comes with clarity of thought – and vice-versa. Design isn’t shallow: We can differentiate ourselves with design – by thinking outside the box and pushing boundaries.

Software. Done right. We perceive software as art &amp; craftsmanship. And as craftsmen we care about how things are made. Our code is robust, high-quality and built to last.

Platform-centric thinking. Orbit is an inter-connected operating system – this is why we always think holistic. Ask not what your feature can do for the platform — ask what the platform can do for your feature.

Easy-(and-enjoyable)-to-use &amp; Self-serviceable to the core. Orbit is enterprise-grade technology and used in complex organisations. Although Orbit is ‘Made for Pros’, ease of use, enjoyable UX and self-service capabilities are non-negotiable.
