Small boutique consulting - junior+ Developer - US Remote (some est meetings) - part-time&#x2F;flexible&#x2F;1099 - $$&#x2F;hr

Hi! I work with a small group of developers doing custom software development and  consulting for small&#x2F;medium businesses. We have enough work where it would be nice to have someone else in our team so we can maybe think about more clients. This is a great opportunity for SAHMs, new parents, etc. who want to get back into the workforce in a very flexible way and don&#x27;t _need_ a full time job, or people who are looking for some supplemental nights and weekend work or maybe transitioning into software development from a different career.

The work is very different by client, so we are always learning new domains, but not terribly difficult, so a year or two of development experience is a great level for us. Our technology stack is anchored in: 
 - JavaScript&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Vue
 - GCP&#x2F;App Engine&#x2F;Cloud Functions
 - Jira&#x2F;Confluence&#x2F;Google Workspace

If this sounds interesting and a good fit your lifestyle, reach out to [the two letter acronym for this site]@cookie.bike

Have a great day!
