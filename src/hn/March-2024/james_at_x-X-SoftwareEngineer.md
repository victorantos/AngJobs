X | Software Engineer

We are hiring software engineers to help integrate xAI’s technology into X - prompt engineering, deploying models at scale, vector database deployment etc. This is an outrageous opportunity to interweave cutting edge AI from one of the strongest teams in the world into a consumer, planet scale app.

We are hiring client, backend and infra engineers. Most importantly we are looking for people who are excited about our mission and building products using our new AI.

Email me if you’re interested and I’ll get in touch.
