Clerk | Frontend &amp; Backend SWE | Remote or in-person in SF

Clerk is hiring frontend and backend engineers, remote or in-office in San Francisco

We build developers tools for authentication. We&#x27;re known for our React components like SignIn and UserProfile that &quot;just work&quot; when they&#x27;re added to the page.

Our components are powered by a new type of API: a frontend-facing API that relies on session tokens for authorization, instead of a backend-facing API that relies on a secret key.

We&#x27;ve found this pattern unlocks a new level of efficiency. Developers can implement Clerk faster than traditional APIs because it comes built-in with UX and UI. To learn more about the approach, see our talk on A Component is Worth a Thousand APIs:

We&#x27;re especially excited to work with engineers who are thoughtful about speed and craft. Clerk is defining the gold standard for components-as-a-service, and we are constantly searching for new ways to evolve and improve our approach. Apply here:

Separately, I&#x27;m one of Clerk&#x27;s cofounders, and I&#x27;ll be watching this thread through the day if I can be help with any questions. Or feel to email me (colin@ our domain)
