Quadrature | London or New York | Full-time | ONSITE | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quadrature.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quadrature.ai&#x2F;</a>

Quadrature is a systematic trading company, in the business of building fully automated trading systems across the global financial markets since its founding in 2010.

We&#x27;re a very tech and research focused org, and are quite different from a lot of other players in the market (more like a tech-driven research institute than a traditional trading firm -- see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quadrature.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quadrature.ai</a> for the details).

We&#x27;re looking for a skilled engineer to optimise the use of GPUs for our AI workloads, for both our model training and inference environments. This is a great opportunity to work with a group of world-class researchers and developers, building out large-scale algorithmic trading systems using cutting-edge tech (advanced ML, thousands of GPUs, multiple global research data centres and trading co-location sites, petabytes of storage, innovation-lab R&amp;D work with strategic partners). It&#x27;ll be based out of either London or New York.

Responsibilities:

- Leading performance optimisation effort for mission-critical end-to-end AI workloads (e.g. profiling and tuning GPU programs, writing custom CUDA kernels, speeding up pre- and post-processing).

- Rewriting core parts of our model architectures for maximum performance.

- Building a runtime environment that maximises the model capacity and speed.
