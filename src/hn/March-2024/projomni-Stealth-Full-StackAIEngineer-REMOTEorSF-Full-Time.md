Stealth | Full-Stack AI Engineer | REMOTE or SF | Full-Time

Hey all - we&#x27;re a stealth startup founded by a serial entrepreneur with a successful exit. Just raised a seed round from top Silicon Valley VCs. We&#x27;re on a mission to fix the healthcare staffing shortage with AI.

We&#x27;re looking for a superbuilder - you should be comfortable getting things done across the whole tech stack. Experience in mobile app development is a big plus. You&#x27;ll have an opportunity to dive into AI and LLMs, and use existing APIs to create new solutions.

We&#x27;re open to bringing on a founding engineer, offering significant equity.

Here is what we use: 1) backend frameworks (Python, Kubernetes, Airflow); 2) frontend libraries (React, Next.js, Expo); 3) advanced machine learning systems.
