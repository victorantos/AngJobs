Vetspire | Senior Software Engineer and Product Manager | Remote | Austin, TX | Full-Time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vetspire.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vetspire.com</a>

Vetspire is an electronic health records and practice management platform for veterinarians. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.

We help your furry best friends live longer and healthier lives by helping their care-givers (veterinarians!) work better and happier—delighted and empowered by technology.

We&#x27;re looking for a full stack engineer to join our small and technical team to continue to bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians&#x27; needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend.

Some examples of what your weeks may look like:

* building remote tools for pet owners to sign consent forms, pay invoices, and fill in information online so they don&#x27;t have to walk into the clinics during the pandemic

* creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time

* designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders.

You&#x27;ll be working directly with the thousands of veterinarians and staff using Vetspire every day, and talking with them often to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It&#x27;s an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone&#x27;s pets. It&#x27;s half-part engineering, half-part problem-solving.

Our backend tech stack is a Phoenix application written in Elixir, our frontend is using React with the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.

We&#x27;re also hiring for a Product Manager role! The PM Will be in charge of the overall Vetspire product, driving our roadmap, meeting with our users, and helping bring our vision into reality.
