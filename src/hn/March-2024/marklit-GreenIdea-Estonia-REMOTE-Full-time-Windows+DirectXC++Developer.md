Green Idea - Estonia - REMOTE - Full-time - Windows + DirectX C++ Developer

I&#x27;m looking for a C++ developer to build Geospatial &#x2F; GIS visualisation and editing tools for Windows. These will work in both 2D and 3D. These will act more like desktop applications like AutoCAD and 3D Studio Max rather than full-screen video game applications.

The project is likely to be iterative so if you thrive on agency and being a part of the brain-storming process, you should feel at home.

Knowledge of the following is expected:

* C++17

* Computer Vision + Graphics, photogrammetry

* CUDA

* DirectX

* DuckDB and SQLite3

* GDAL and GEOS

* Packaging Windows Applications for distribution

* Python

* QGIS &amp; ArcGIS Pro

* WinUI 3 and Windows Ribbon

We&#x27;re based in Estonia but flexible with time zones between here and California.

Contact me via <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;marklitwintschik&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;marklitwintschik&#x2F;</a> to apply for the role.
