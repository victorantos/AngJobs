Tenzir - Remote (EU) or Hamburg, Germany - open-core - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenzir.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenzir.com</a>

Tenzir is hiring several key engineering roles to meet the needs in expanding the team. Our product: security data pipelines. From the data side, think of it as an Arrow-native, multi-schema ETL tool that offers optional storage in Parquet&#x2F;Feather. From the security perspective, think of it as a solution for collecting, parsing, transforming, aggregating, and routing data. We typically sit between the data sources (endpoint, network, cloud) and sinks (SIEM, data lake).

Our open-source execution engine is C++20 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tenzir&#x2F;tenzir">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tenzir&#x2F;tenzir</a>), our platform is SvelteKit and TypeScript. Experience with data-first frontend apps is a great plus. Open positions at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenzir.jobs.personio.de" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenzir.jobs.personio.de</a>:
