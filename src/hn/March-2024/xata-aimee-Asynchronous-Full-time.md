Xata is building a modern cloud database on top of PostgreSQL. We offer features like: automatic scaling, branches, zero-downtime migrations, a built-in search engine, analytics, and more.

- You&#x27;ll have a lot of flexibility and autonomy. We don&#x27;t track hours and we don&#x27;t count PRs.
- We&#x27;ve raised $35 million and have years of runway. We&#x27;re building for the long term.
