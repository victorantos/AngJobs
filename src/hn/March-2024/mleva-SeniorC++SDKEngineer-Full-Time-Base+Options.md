VIAM -- NYC (Hybrid&#x2F;Flexible)| Senior C++ SDK Engineer | Full-Time | Base + Options

Viam is a comprehensive open-source platform that simplifies the building, monitoring, and data management of smart machines.

Our SDK team is responsible for making the Viam platform language agnostic so developers can use whatever language they like to program a smart machine, robot, smart home system, or other devices.

This role will be the primary contributor to our C++ SDK and will drive its continued development and evolution. Experience with C++, and designing and developing SDKs, Libraries, Drivers, or API&#x27;s is required.

Any interest? Please reach out to me directly at Matt.Leva@Viam.com, or apply at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;f72ceb484us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;f72ceb484us</a>
