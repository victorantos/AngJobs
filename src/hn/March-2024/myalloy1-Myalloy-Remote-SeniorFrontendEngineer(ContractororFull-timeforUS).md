Myalloy | Remote | Senior Frontend Engineer (Contractor or Full-time for US)

Alloy is on a mission to revolutionize menopause healthcare for women over 40. Recognizing the lack of effective solutions for the 47 million women entering menopause annually, Alloy provides evidence-based, holistic solutions and expertise to help women feel fantastic during this phase of life. Founded by Anne Fulenwider and Monica Molenaar, whose personal experience with surgical menopause led her to seek better solutions, Alloy is dedicated to offering credible information, safe treatments, and a supportive community for women navigating menopause. Join us in empowering women to reclaim their health and vitality.

I&#x27;m Head of Engineering for our 7 person development team. We build and maintain a marketing site, customer portal, internal apps, backend systems to connect to a doctor portal, payment, and pharmacy fulfillment. You&#x27;ll receive quite a lot of ownership, but we&#x27;ll support you every step of the way.

We are looking for a mid to senior React&#x2F;Next.js developer to continue redesigning our marketing site to take it to the next level, as well as providing more personalization opportunities for our customers. We have a dozen or so menopause-trained doctors on staff that care deeply about our customers, providing dosage and form factor personalization to help women feel their best.

Tech: React&#x2F;Next.js&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Postgres, Metabase and Retool for internal admin&#x2F;reporting, hosted on Render.
