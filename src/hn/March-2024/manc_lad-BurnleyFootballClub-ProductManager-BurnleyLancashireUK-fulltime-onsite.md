Burnley Football Club | Product Manager | Burnley Lancashire UK | full time | on site

Do you want to help build the football club of the future? With big ambitions to reinvent how a football club is run, I&#x27;m looking to hire a Product Manager in a new technology department to work in every area of the football club. HR, medical, retail, stadium hardware and more. It&#x27;s a full stack technology job. Initially building partnerships and then custom tech it&#x27;s exposure from the ground up in a startup like environment.

If you&#x27;re interested in complex and high performance businesses and working in focused commercial businesses then this is a big challenge.
