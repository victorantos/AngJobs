Sourcetable - Product Engineers (React &#x2F; Python &#x2F; AI) - Staff level - FULL-TIME - San Francisco

We&#x27;re building an AI-native spreadsheet. Seed funded, experienced team, moving quickly. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com&#x2F;jobs#fullstack-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com&#x2F;jobs#fullstack-engineer</a>

This role requires deep experience in both React and Python. AI exposure is desired but not required. More than half the team are ex-founders, so early startup experience and a good sense of humor are great traits.
