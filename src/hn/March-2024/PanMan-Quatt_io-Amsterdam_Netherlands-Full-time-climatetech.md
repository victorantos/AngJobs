Quatt.io | Amsterdam, Netherlands | Full-time | Hybrid&#x2F;ONSITE | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quatt.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quatt.io</a> | climate tech

I&#x27;m head of Software at Quatt, a quickly growing startup building hybrid heatpumps to help fix climate change. Heating and cooling is 50% of all energy used in the EU, and heatpumps have a 10x higher return on investment for CO2 saved per Euro invested than electric cars. We&#x27;re building the most accessible and smartest heatpump on the market. Our product is live, being installed daily, and I really like the impact we&#x27;re having.
I&#x27;m currently looking for 2 roles for my department, as we believe having the best software will allow us to have the best product.

* Team Lead Internal Tools
* Test Automation Engineer

Now is a great time to join, as the software team is still small but growing quickly.
