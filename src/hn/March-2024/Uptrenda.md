Hey people, good luck to everyone currently looking for work. It&#x27;s an emotional roller coaster. But I do think the tech job market is much better now compared to how it was. If you haven&#x27;t looked for work in a while all of these things are normal:

- Complete radio silence for the first month, followed by a deluge of interest.

- Feeling depressed, hopeless, or under appreciated.

- Rejections (lots of rejections)

Try not to take it personally and keep going. You got this.
