Countfire - Senior Fullstack Developer - Remote (but must based in UK) - www.countfire.com

Countfire makes software for the construction industry. Our software is well loved because we try to design solutions that are a magnitude more efficient than existing tools.

We use all sorts of tech, but mostly MobX, React, Typescript, Python, Hasura and Postgres. Looking for people with a good understanding of React.

Previously based in London, now seeking remote devs across the UK.
