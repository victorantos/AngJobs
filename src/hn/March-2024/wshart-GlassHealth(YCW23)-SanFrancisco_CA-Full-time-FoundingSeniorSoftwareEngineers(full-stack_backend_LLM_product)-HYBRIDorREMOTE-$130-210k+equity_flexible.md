Glass Health (YC W23) | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | Founding Senior Software Engineers (full-stack, backend, LLM, product) | HYBRID or REMOTE | $130-210k + equity, flexible

We build a platform for AI-assisted medical diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Doctors spend twice as much time with computers as they do with patients; our product helps doctors make decisions and draft documentation in seconds. To date, tens of thousands of clinicians have used Glass to generate drafts of differential diagnoses and clinical plans.

We went through Y Combinator this year and recently announced a $5M seed round (led by Initialized), which included some of the most brilliant founders in healthtech: Tom Lee, founder of One Medical; Connor Landgraf, founder and CEO of Eko Health; and Heather Hasson and Trina Spear, the co-founders of FIGS. Weâ€™ve also been featured in leading clinical lectures like UCSF Grand Rounds and news outlets like NPR and TechCrunch.

Both hybrid and fully remote available. For hybrid: we work in person at an office in San Francisco two days a week. Remote is optional for the remaining days, although the office space is fully available at any time! Unfortunately, we are unable to offer visa sponsorship.

I (Graham) previously worked at Modern Fertility (YC S19) and our CEO&#x2F;my co-founder Dereck is a doctor who studied medicine at UCSF and Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital. Join us!

Tech Stack: Django, Typescript, React, Redux, Postgres
