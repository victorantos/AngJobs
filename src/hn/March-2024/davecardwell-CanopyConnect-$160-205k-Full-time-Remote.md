Canopy Connect | $160-205k | Full-time | Remote | US &amp; Canada only | Product Engineer
Canopy Connect is single-click insurance data sharing (like &quot;Plaid for insurance&quot;).

We serve over 3,500 companies (and growing rapidly!) including insurance agencies, lenders, insurtechs, fintechs, and insurance carriers to streamline acquiring verified insurance data from consumers and businesses.

We&#x27;re hiring Product Engineers. We&#x27;re a small, fully remote team based in the US and Canada. We present the best of both worlds - a nimble startup and small team (low strike price on equity and more ownership&#x2F;impact), yet derisked because of our capital efficiency.
