Hi, my name is Peter, and I lead the Web team at 10x Genomics. If you want to work on a modern tech stack, on the cutting-edge of biology, while doing unambiguous good in the world, check us out.

We make instruments and software that enable scientists to study biology at single-cell resolution. Our technology features in over 7,000 scientific publications (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;publications" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;publications</a>), and is used across the world by top research institutions, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies to study cancer, immunology, developmental biology, and more.

Our user-facing applications - which include the public website, a web-based analysis platform, visualization apps, instrument UIs, and more - have React&#x2F;Typescript frontends and Golang backends, with some Rust for algorithms. We&#x27;re hiring right now to accelerate our Web platform and e-commerce efforts.

As a public company with growing revenues, we offer full benefits, competitive compensation including bonuses and stock grants, and a Netflix-style vacation policy.
