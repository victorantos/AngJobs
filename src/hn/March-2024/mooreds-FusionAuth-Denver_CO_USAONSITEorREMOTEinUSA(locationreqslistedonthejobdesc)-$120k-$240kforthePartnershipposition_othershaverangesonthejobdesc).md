Our mission is to make authentication and authorization simple and secure for every developer building web and mobile applications. We want devs to stop worrying about auth and focus on building something awesome.

If you are passionate about technology and want to join a company moving the industry forward, FusionAuth might be a great fit for you. Our core software is commercial with a &quot;free as in beer&quot; version. We also open source much of our supporting infrastructure. We are profitable but raised a round recently to accelerate our growth (more on that here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusionauth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fusionauth-funding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusionauth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fusionauth-funding</a> ).

Technologies and standards that we use or implement: Modern Java, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, OAuth, SAML, OIDC.

I want to highlight the Manager&#x2F;Director of Partnerships and Alliances position in this post because this is a key hire for us. We already have a few channel sales through hyperscalers and consulting partners, but this hire will really define (and launch) the channel sales function, build the marketplace sales funnel, and manage referral, reseller, and technology partnerships. This position is remote friendly in the USA.
