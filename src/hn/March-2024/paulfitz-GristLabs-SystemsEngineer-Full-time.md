Grist Labs - Systems Engineer - Full-time - NYC OR REMOTE +&#x2F;- 3hrs - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getgrist.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getgrist.com</a>

We&#x27;re looking for someone to make our modern spreadsheet software run everywhere. To apply, there&#x27;s a puzzle. Just do:
   docker run -it gristlabs&#x2F;grist-twist
and poke around. If the words battery correct horse staple mean something to you, you might have an advantage.

The heart of the software you&#x27;ll be working with: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gristlabs&#x2F;grist-core&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gristlabs&#x2F;grist-core&#x2F;</a>
More information about job and company: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getgrist.com&#x2F;job-systems-engineer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getgrist.com&#x2F;job-systems-engineer&#x2F;</a>

The essential requirement for the job is comfort working with operating systems and containers, and having some back-end programming experience. People with a dev-ops background will do well. If you have strong open source experience, even better.

Have you seen people install your popular software in weird and wonderful places, and seen all the weird and wonderful problems that crop up? Ever wanted to really go all in on making an app or library that can go anywhere? If so, you&#x27;re the kind of person we want to talk to. Our software can already be used everywhere: as a commercial SaaS, or as part of a government office suite, running on servers owned by enterprises and citizen self-hosters, desktops, air-gapped installations, compiled to pure in-browser javascript, rippling like a dream through the etheric plane (well, not this last one yet). But it isn&#x27;t always easy, and that&#x27;s where you come in!
