Procedural question: The REMOTE thing is not specific enough.

I tentatively request suggestions (RFC) for a standard way of expressing <i>remoteness:</i>

<pre><code>  - remote in one country 
  - remote in region
  - remote by exact timezone
  - remote by timezone range (or official office hours)
  - mostly remote, with some country qualification
  - really, truly, totally remote
</code></pre>
<i>In country,</i> is because the company wants just one legal jurisdiction for employment, perhaps also for some filter on criminality&#x2F;identity&#x2F;banking.

<i>In region</i> is not really defined in the world, except EU has some common employment law, corporate&#x2F;banking harmonization, and small timezone spread.

Countries are not necessarily temporally <i>compact</i> in the sense of only 1 timezone. Obviously Russia, Canada, US... are extreme examples. Chile is well-behaved. But some places are split on daylight savings, so that is not strictly included in the criterion, there is just +-1hr in summer&#x2F;winter.

<i>Exact timezone</i> might allow various N-S combinations, such as London-Lisbon.

<i>Timezone range</i> might allow London-Cape Town, or any US and Mexico. It&#x27;s really overlapping office hours for core meeting schedule, independent of country.

<i>Mostly remote</i> might have some global freedom, but be limited to where the company has a legal entity for employment - or the opposite for contractors. Note that these may conflict: so you may not hire an &#x27;offshore&#x27; contractor in a country where you have a legal presence (e.g. US company hires contractor through a Singapore company, but the contractor actually lives in Myanmar, which may be on the blacklist - see below, yes it is - or say India, where the original hiring company has a legal presence).

<i>Totally remote</i> does not exist. There are legal and financial sanctions that exist from West-G7-G20-OECD against various other countries that are beyond-the-pale. The core subset of rejects are the obvious axis-of-evilly kinda places, but there are many excluded by a corrupt banking system, or cyberattack risk (assuming you ship laptop or have connectivity through local country ISP - surely not, that&#x27;s what VPNs are for, but try asking to live in China :) For example, N. Korea is obviously off-the-table, so is Vietnam, okay nice cheap place to live but I understand, however the Philippines as well (really?) yes, I assume mafia&#x2F;banking or something.
