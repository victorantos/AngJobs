Staff Security Engineer - FullStory - Atlanta or Remote (USA) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;</a>

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;8cf67d8a-053d-4de1-aca2-b3b41158c7af&#x2F;?ashby_jid=8cf67d8a-053d-4de1-aca2-b3b41158c7af&amp;utm_source=092d6dbxgV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;8cf67d8a-053d-4de1-ac...</a>

FullStory provides analytics and session replay for mobile apps and websites.

I&#x27;m an engineer on the mobile team, so I don&#x27;t know a ton about this role, but I do know that FullStory completed a SOC 2 Type 2,  ISO 27001 certification, and has a bunch of other compliance and security certifications on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trust.fullstory.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trust.fullstory.com&#x2F;</a> - we deal with a lot of data and we take it&#x27;s security seriously.

I&#x27;m not sure what the pay offered is, but I can say that as a Staff Software Engineer, I make a bit over $200k base + bonus + equity. All the usual benefits: healthcare, 401k matching, unlimited PTO (I take about 5 weeks a year), etc.
