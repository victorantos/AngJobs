Offsite.com - Remote - Full-time - Fully remote US-based company

Looking for a mid-level to senior fullstack TypeScript engineer. Experience Building Marketplaces Required.

Offsite ([www.offsite.com](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.offsite.com&#x2F;inquiry?utm=engineeringjd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.offsite.com&#x2F;inquiry?utm=engineeringjd</a>)) makes it easy to plan team retreats, offsites, and conferences.

Used by hundreds of top startups, Inc 5000s, nonprofits, and other organizations, Offsite is already a marketplace that has facilitated $10M+ in spend on offsites, with a user base growing 50% quarter-over-quarter, and a team that has hit or exceeded sales targets for 8 months in a row (and counting).

Offsite.com is VC-backed (raised $3.1M seed from Automattic, makers of WordPress, Forum Ventures, and 60+ angel investors), break-even (ie not burning lots of money), and growing.

The engineering team is building the platform and marketplace for planning, booking, and managing Offsites. We’re looking for the next engineer to help bring our marketplace to life (basically Airbnb for offsites).

Ideally you’re experienced building various aspects of a B2B or “prosumer” marketplace, and are looking to develop new products today as an individual contributor. Everyone on the engineering team is building the marketplace from the ground up, and shipping key features such as a Stripe integration to facilitate marketplace transactions, messaging, support for multiple vendors, attendee and vendor dashboards, etc.

We work with TypeScript across the stack, using NextJS, Node, and GraphQL.

The ideal candidate would have at least 2-4 years of experience, works collaboratively across the company including with non-technical roles, excited to travel to 2 annual Offsite offsites and wants to help develop a category-defining product and company.

The starting salary for this role is $100,000 - $150,000 USD (depending on experience), plus healthcare, a monthly Remote Work stipend, an annual Health and Wellness stipend, unlimited PTO, and the ability to work from anywhere. You will also be eligible for equity options in Offsite.
