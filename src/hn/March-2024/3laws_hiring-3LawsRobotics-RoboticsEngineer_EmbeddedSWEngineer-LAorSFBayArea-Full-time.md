New Startup in the Robotics Space Looking for Robotics and Embedded Software Engineers!

3Laws is an early stage startup working on developing an intelligent robotic e-stop for lowering the barrier to commercialization of safe autonomous systems. The company was founded with the backing of Caltech as a response to the traction our research in safety-critical control got with our industrial research partners at the time. We have since brought together a team of advisors, entrepreneurs, and engineers with a wealth of experience in taking new technologies like this one to market.
