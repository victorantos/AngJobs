Anvil (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anvil.works</a>) | Senior Developer | Cambridge, UK | ONSITE, VISA | Full-time&#x2F;part-time&#x2F;flexible

We make an open-source web framework, an online code editor, a GUI builder, and a PaaS hosting platform. Together, you can build and host a full-stack web application - and all you need is a little Python. (Yes, even the client-side code - we compile Python to JS and provide a GUI framework!)

We’re looking for an experienced all-rounder to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on the back-end. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but we&#x27;re looking for someone who isn&#x27;t afraid to jump into something you haven&#x27;t used before.

You’ll be working with other seriously good all-rounders, including the founders (relevant PhDs, kernel contributors, builders of backyard dancing fountains) and senior colleagues (eg: a former maths teacher who reverse-engineered our drag&#x27;n&#x27;drop editor to build more UI components), as well as our other developers and developer advocates. We&#x27;re bootstrapped and profitable, with a small, smart, friendly and diverse team.

Building dev tools is great! We&#x27;re solving problems we&#x27;ve experienced ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms have the most fun engineering problems.

We work hybrid (in the office Tue-Thu, wherever you like Mon&#x2F;Fri). If you have questions, I&#x27;m a founder and my email&#x27;s in my profile.
