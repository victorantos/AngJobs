AE Studio - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ae.studio&#x2F;join-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ae.studio&#x2F;join-us</a> -- Data Scientists - Full-Time - Los Angeles &#x2F; Brazil or REMOTE (US &#x2F; Brazilian work hours)

We are AE Studio, a bootstrapped software and data science consulting business. Our mission has always been to reroute our profits directly into building technologies that have the promise of dramatically enhancing human agency, like Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). Today, we are ~150 programmers, product designers, and ML engineers; we are profitable and growing. We also have a team of top neuroscientists and data scientists with significant experience in developing ML solutions for leading BCI companies, and we are now leveraging our technical experience and learnings in these domains to assemble an alignment team dedicated to exploring neglected alignment research directions that draw on our expertise in BCI, data science, and ML.

Weâ€™re looking for experienced (ideally mid to senior-level), product-focused data scientists with ML experience who are excited about working on a variety of client projects (spanning a variety of domains and technologies),  and advancing our research in BCI and alignment.
