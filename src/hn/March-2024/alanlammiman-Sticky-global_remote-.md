Sticky - Social Media&#x2F;Marketing&#x2F;Community Lead - global, remote -

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;zombie-games-more&#x2F;id1497044357" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;zombie-games-more&#x2F;id1497044357</a>

Sticky is an integrated mobile platform for games, communities, creating &amp; collecting &amp; trading virtual items. We aim to be what facebook might have become if it hadn&#x27;t killed its dev platform to become a walled-garden cash-cow. Or what web3 might be with more focus on user needs, less on blockchain technicalities, and without get-rich-quick schemes.

For further context - our initial approach to the above was to create the first iOS-native NFT marketplace (i.e. letting users trade NFTs with in-app-purchases). The web3 ecosystem was messy, but we believed it would mature into lots of great projects&#x2F;games&#x2F;clubs for our app to connect to. We have been rather disappointed on that front, so now that we are integrating games and communities into the app, we are starting with a roguelike zombie survival game we developed in-house as a proof of concept before any outside games. Our site still focuses on the former, the iOS app linked above already shows the latter. We are a 6 person remote team (4 devs, 1 designer, 1 lead), between Seed and Series A.

We are looking for someone to lead our Social Media, Community and Marketing efforts. Our own experience is in performance marketing for apps - there is a place for a bit of that here, but given what we are doing, marketing that is organic &amp; community &amp; mission-driven is much more important. Requirements: interest in the cause &amp; product + prior experience fostering powerful communities  + fluent English as demonstrated in CV + cover letter, portfolio or publications.

We are also interested in a Product Manager (or Designer with strong product skills) who would like to build this with us. Requirement: interest in the cause &amp; product + prior experience creating fun B2C mobile apps or games as demonstrated in portfolio.

Please email talent [at] getstic.ky

Questions and comments very welcome :)
