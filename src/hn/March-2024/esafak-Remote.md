Archipelago AI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archipelago-ai.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archipelago-ai.com</a>) | Infrastructure (SRE&#x2F;Platform) and Backend Engineer | Part&#x2F;Full-time | Remote

Our company is dedicated to improving distributed work through better communication tools. More productive, and more conducive to forming the social ties that we associate with face-to-face interaction.

We are hiring a part-time infra engineer to ensure our security, and increase our productivity. You&#x27;ll own traditional infra duties like observability, IaC, CI&#x2F;CD, Kubernetes, authn&#x2F;authz, backups, networking and security.

We also have a full-time opening for a backend engineer versed in distributed systems and message-oriented middleware, or at least pub&#x2F;sub. Knowledge of Kotlin and NATS a plus. You&#x27;ll get to dabble in machine learning too, if you want.

Send your resume to hiring@[domain] and indicate which position you are interested in, or message us at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;archipelago-ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;archipelago-ai&#x2F;</a>

We are only able to accommodate US citizens and GC holders at the moment; no H1B, C2C, OPT&#x2F;CPT. We look forward to relaxing this requirement in the future.
