Apsona | Full stack engineer | Remote US | $75 - $100 per hour, PTO | Contractor (Full-time hours) | apsona.com

At Apsona, we make tools on the Salesforce AppExchange that provide Salesforce admins and users with powerful and flexible reporting, document and email generation, data tools, and more.

What&#x27;s unique about us: we already have thousands of delighted customers, but we are a very small team looking to grow. So you get all the benefits of a startup and none of the risk. The jobs are very stable.

We&#x27;re looking for an experienced full-stack engineer to join our team. You would be the second full-time engineer in the US, so we are looking for someone senior who is comfortable wearing many hats.

Learn more at bit.ly&#x2F;ApsonaDeveloper. You can apply by emailing careers@apsona.com.
