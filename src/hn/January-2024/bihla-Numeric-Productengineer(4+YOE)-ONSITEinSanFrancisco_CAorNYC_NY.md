Numeric - Product engineer (4+ YOE) - ONSITE in San Francisco, CA or NYC, NY - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numeric.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numeric.io</a>

Come join us to build the modern accounting &amp; finance platform. Companies like Wealthfront, AngelList, Clearbit, and more depend on Numeric to collaborate &amp; automate their workflows, as well as to monitor, analyze, and share insights on their financial data.

Companies want up-to-date, accurate, useful financial data as easily and often as possible; good data enables good operations and decision-making. Today&#x27;s systems unfortunately do little to help, and accountants are relegated to fairly manual data entry and error checking. We&#x27;re tackling these foundational problems and we need great engineers.

We&#x27;re an early company with top-tier investors, wonderful customers, and large ambitions. We work in person and value high ownership and velocity.

Looking for product &amp; customer-focused engineers[1]; this will fit if you like to build quickly, contribute to product direction, and know your users.

Bonus points for startup experience and&#x2F;or full-stack experience with Typescript. 4+ YOE.
