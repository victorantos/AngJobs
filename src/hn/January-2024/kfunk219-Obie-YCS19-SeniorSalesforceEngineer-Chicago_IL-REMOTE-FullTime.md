Obie is looking for passionate, talented senior salesforce engineer to join us. The Salesforce Developer is a highly technical position, and will be responsible for leading the design and development of custom solutions that include application processing platforms for programs. The role is primarily back-end Salesforce development, however, the individual in this role must be able to perform front-end development duties as needed (minimum of 3 years of front-end developing experience).

We are a venture-backed technology company. Our early success is in large part due to our unwavering standards in hiring. We recognize that our product is only as good as the people building and promoting it. We look for individuals who find solutions by going through the cycle of ideation to implementation with curiosity, rigor and a highly analytical lens.

At Obie, we judge people based on the merit of their work. If you are passionate about what this role entails, are excited by solving real problems, and you want to help shape the future of commercial real estate, we want to hear from you.

We&#x27;re based in Chicago with remote employees across the US and Canada.

We welcome US&#x2F;Canadian based remote applicants, but be warned: we&#x27;ll try to persuade you to move to the City by the Lake.
