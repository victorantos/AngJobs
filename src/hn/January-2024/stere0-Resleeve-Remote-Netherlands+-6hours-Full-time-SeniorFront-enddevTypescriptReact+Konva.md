Resleeve | Remote | Netherlands +- 6 hours | Full-time | Senior Front-end dev Typescript React + Konva

We are on our way to transform how fashion designers develop their next fashion item and get a photoshoot from that item. Instead of going through multiple drafts, creating a dummy, and hiring a photographer and model, all can now be achieved through Resleeve Studio. We were founded one year ago and pivoted in September. We launched and have a steadily growing revenue.

We are a collaborative remote-first company with team members spread from Kazakstan to New York and Uganda. We will provide you with an environment where you will work with the CEO and the CTO (me, ex MLE leader at Bain &amp; Co and BCG) to develop new features for our studio and work with our end-users to address their business needs.

Sounds exciting? We are recruiting for multiple roles:
