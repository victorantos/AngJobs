Homebase Automation - Full-time or part-time - Remote (UTC-8 to UTC+2)

- Staff frontend developer (React, Typescript, XState, PixiJS)

Approximately $450b is spent annually on home improvement in the U.S. Weâ€™re tapping into this market by building tools that empower homeowners to manage the complexity of the renovation lifecycle. This market is vastly underserved, with existing offerings targeting industry professionals as opposed to homeowners. Our tools put everyday people back in charge of what is happening under their roof.

Our interview process aims to respect your time: async technical discussion with our CTO about past experiences and engineering philosophy, paid take-home coding exercise representative of our work, final conversation with CEO and offer.
