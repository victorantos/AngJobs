Valonâ€™s mission is to champion homeowners as the partner they trust with their home and future. Our ultimate goal is to guide homeowners through every step of their financial journey, no matter what life puts on their path. Mortgage servicing is a counter-cyclical business (which is part of the reason we started this company!) and gets paid a recurring revenue based on mortgage loans outstanding (which doesn&#x27;t really change even when mortgage originations slow). We  5x our loan count in 2023!
