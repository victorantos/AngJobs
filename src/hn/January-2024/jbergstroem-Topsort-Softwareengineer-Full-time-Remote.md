Topsort - Software engineer - Full-time - Remote

Topsort (topsort.com) is a leading retail media solution, enabling marketplaces and retailers to build out their own ad business with a strong emphasis on privacy - no third party cookies required.

We are a global, remote first company with diverse backgrounds and need to grow the engineering team in most areas but currently have a focus in finding engineers with experience in component and design systems (shadcn, aria, storybook, ..), react and don&#x27;t mind the occasional dive into other areas and other programming languages.

You are a good fit if: you&#x27;ve built and implemented design systems with reusable components in React, you are obsessed about performant frontends, you&#x27;re comfortable in working with Next.js (both pages and app router), you are proactive and like to take ownership, you have worked in full stack environments but have a specialization in frontend.

Our stack: Golang, Python, Typescript (Node.js, Bun), Rust, Postgres, Kafka, Snowflake, Clickhouse, Aws, ..

Feel free to send your CV&#x2F;github&#x2F;work examples (I&#x27;m the tech lead at Topsort) if you think this is for you! johan at topsort dot com.
