Symmetry investments | London OR remote (European timezone), VISA | Full time | Senior ReactJS developer

I&#x27;m Jacques. I&#x27;m a senior developer. I don&#x27;t work in HR, but I&#x27;m posting this because I really want to work with talented people.

Symmetry investments is a hedge fund that deals with a wide variety of financial products, but we mostly focus on fixed income. We&#x27;re building a new web team to build internal tooling. No finance experience necessary. We&#x27;re a relatively flat organization with minimal bureaucracy. You&#x27;ll be working with another senior ReactJS developer (myself) and a UI&#x2F;UX specialist. Since it&#x27;s a new team, there isn&#x27;t much legacy code. Everyone is friendly and it&#x27;s easy to propose new initiatives.

Relevant industry experience: TypeScript&#x2F;ReactJS experience: 4+ years

Other requirements: Must be living in a timezone between England and Hong Kong OR be willing to relocate to London.

In the cover letter section, please answer the following question: What is the most technically challenging thing you&#x27;ve implemented in ReactJS and why was it technically challenging? (4 sentences maximum. Avoid buzzwords. Don&#x27;t mention impact. It will be read by myself.)
