Digital Harbor Foundation - Machine Learning Engineer - REMOTE (US Only)

Digital Harbor Foundation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalharbor.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalharbor.org</a>) is a not-for-profit grant-funded organization dedicated to increasing access to empowering technologies in under-served communities. As part of that work, our Learning Engineering team provides technical support to the Learning Engineering Virtual Institute (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learning-engineering-virtual-institute.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learning-engineering-virtual-institute.org</a>). LEVI&#x27;s goal is to build software and systems that will double students&#x27; rate of progress in middle school math.  This means that LEVI teams both build products and do research to determine product efficacy - and we help with both.

We&#x27;re seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join our team. This person would serve as on-call support, helping university and ed-tech teams implement, scale, and test their digital learning products. We&#x27;re looking for someone who is a quick learner, is very collaborative, is familiar (or can quickly become familiar) with GCP&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;Azure, and who has some experience with machine learning, MLOps, and data science generally.  We are also looking for someone who understands the needs of both engineers and researchers, and can translate between the two groups.

This is a great role for someone interested in working with the top organizations and funders in the ed-tech space.  It&#x27;s also a great position if you&#x27;d like to use and evaluate LLMs in educational settings. The position is fully remote, but we have an in-person convening once a year. We also support travel to 1-2 conferences a year, with bonus points if you are presenting.
