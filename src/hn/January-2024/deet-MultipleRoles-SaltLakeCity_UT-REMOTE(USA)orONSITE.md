Avy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avy.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avy.ai</a>) - Multiple Roles - Salt Lake City, UT - REMOTE (USA) or ONSITE

We are an early-stage, well-funded, stealth startup making humans and computers work together more efficiently. Experienced team from Apple AIML, Bose, Amazon, and other great companies.

We&#x27;re hiring for:

- Generalist AI&#x2F;ML engineer (writing agent code, RAG, prompt engineering, etc)

- Senior Applied AI&#x2F;ML engineer (including LLM fine-tuning, search&#x2F;retrieval systems, and various vision and NLP tasks)

- Marketing (in the &quot;growth hacker&quot; spirit) -- if your dream is to launch the fastest-growing B2B SaaS product ever, we want to talk with you.

- MacOS (Swift, Objective-C, C&#x2F;C++, etc) at the Senior and Staff levels. iOS experience is OK.

We&#x27;re distributed but expect travel for regularly scheduled on-site, in-person work in SLC, with future presence in New York City.
