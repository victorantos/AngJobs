Skyways (YC 2017 batch) - Austin, TX or Pittsburgh, PA - Onsite - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyways.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyways.com</a>

At Skyways we believe fully autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles represent a unique opportunity to move things today but also people tomorrow in new, more efficient ways. With our very pragmatic approach to the problem we now signed national and international customers, institutional and soon commercial ones this year. We do release early, release often and we fly our own aircraft almost every day.

We are looking for a senior software engineer to lead the software and autonomy effort at Skyways. This role involves at least 50% coding, the other 50% being design, reviews, and leading the team from a technical standpoint. If you&#x27;re interested in a super high impact and hands on position at the intersection of backend, frontend, traditional software engineering, ML, robotics, embedded, cloud, apply or DM us on linked in.
