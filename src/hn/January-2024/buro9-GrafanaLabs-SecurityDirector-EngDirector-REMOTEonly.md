Grafana Labs | Backend &#x2F; Systems Engineers | Security Director | Eng Director | REMOTE only

Grafana, we make Grafana (visualisation), Loki (for logs), Mimir (for metrics), Tempo (for traces), Pyroscope (for profiles), OnCall, Application Observability and a lot more. Most of our work is open source as AGPL or Apache2. Most work is Go, JavaScript, but there&#x27;s also eBPF, C, Python, and Java in some areas.

We are looking for backend engineers to work on the distributed databases Mimir  and Loki. The Mimir role is within the Americas time zone as the on-call hours align to daylight hours, so we are global remote but hire to make on-call healthy and balanced. The Loki role is within EMEA timezones. Those are the roles in my area, and I&#x27;m writing the post :D but there are more roles open.

The Eng Director role is within EMEA timezones.

The Security Director role is US timezones, and for this specific role you must be a US citizen.

You can find more information about these and other roles on our website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;</a>
