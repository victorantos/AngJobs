Felt | Engineering Manager, App and Data | Oakland, CA or REMOTE (US timezones) | Full Time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com</a>

Felt is the best way to make maps on the internet. It&#x27;s surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. Climate change and the resulting natural disasters are forcing even more people to become map-makers, and Felt is here to meet that need. It&#x27;s the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I&#x27;m an early Uber engineer.

We are on the lookout for a hands-on engineering manager for our application and data teams. Our application team builds what our end-users experience; a lightning fast and easy-to-use mapping tool that works in the browser. We are primarily using Elixir &#x2F; Phoenix on the server side and have a spatially focused React on the frontend side. As an engineering manager, you&#x27;ll be working with folks who are experts in their field [2], release more than 15+ a day [3], and aren&#x27;t afraid to break new ground when necessary [4].

Our data team makes geospatial datasets a breeze to work with and we are currently building our next-generation of our data stack on AWS. The team you&#x27;ll be managing is full of expert engineers from Facebook, Carto, Mapbox, and Uber. You might have used their work in mapping already; such as Tippecanoe. We also recently announced our sponsorship of QGIS [5] and have some amazing stuff planned in the next couple of quarters.

We are well-funded and just raised our $15M Series A. You can read more about it our funding here [6], and our announcement here [6]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[7]

If you are an experienced manager, please reach out via hello@felt.com and mention HN.
