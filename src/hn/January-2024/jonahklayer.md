Layer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildwithlayer.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildwithlayer.com</a>) is hiring a full-stack and machine learning engineer. We just closed a $3M seed round (Drive Capital-led). Strong preference for ability to relocate to Columbus, OH where our team is based. Weâ€™re building a framework that helps companies build AI copilots to make their software easier for people to use.

Feel free to reach out to me directly at jonahk@buildwithlayer.com if you love to build and are interested in learning more about what we do. This is an opportunity to be on the ground floor of a company that is solving real problems in the LLM space.
