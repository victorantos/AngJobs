TalkJS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkjs.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkjs.com</a>) | REMOTE (Europe &#x2F; Middle East &#x2F; Africa)

TalkJS lets developers build a perfect chat feature in just a few minutes. We power communication in online marketplaces, community sites, multiplayer apps, trading platforms and so on. We&#x27;re product driven and we care tremendously about quality.

We&#x27;re headquartered in the Netherlands and our team is spread across the Central European Timezone +&#x2F;- 3h.

We&#x27;re particularly looking for:

<pre><code>    * Mobile SDK Developer (iOS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;React Native&#x2F;Flutter)
    * Full-stack Developer (TypeScript&#x2F;Elixir&#x2F;Postgres)
</code></pre>
If you enjoy crafting perfect libraries and APIs for other programmers to use, get in touch!

TalkJS touches millions of people and is growing quickly. We want to be the tool that every developer thinks of for building communication features, a bit like what Stripe is for payments. 80% of the company is product people, founders are a designer and a programmer.

Our strategy is to give great engineers the maximum amount of freedom, so they can ship fantastic SDKs, APIs and features. This means a lot of responsibility, a sane work&#x2F;life balance, no meetings, no red tape. We&#x27;re growing, profitable, and not dependent on venture funding. Sound good?
