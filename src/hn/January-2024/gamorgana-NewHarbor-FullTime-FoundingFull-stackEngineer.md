New Harbor | New York City - Hybrid&#x2F;Onsite | Full Time |  Founding Full-stack Engineer

We’re an early stage cybersecurity-as-a-service startup. Our product protects users from the most common attacks in a way that respects their productivity. Think what Gusto does for payroll, QuickBooks for accounting, and ZipRecruiter for hiring.

We are looking for a founding full-stack engineer with 4+ years of experience who’s excited to work alongside us to build out our automated + AI product and scale to additional customers. Cybersecurity experience is not required.

You will join a small team who’s lived this problem, shipped products to millions at Google, startups &amp; the government, and is looking to bring simplicity back to cybersecurity for the tens of thousands of organizations that need a simple off-the-shelf solution.
