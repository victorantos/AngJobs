Omnigres - Founding Engineer - SF Bay Area HQ - REMOTE

At Omnigres, our north star is to enable developers to laser-focus on business needs instead of fighting technological challenges.
We&#x27;re fighting the complexity and inefficiencies of contemporary stacks by removing them instead of hiding them.

At the core, we are turning Postgres into an Application Runtime. Why? Because we believe that code and data are inseparable in pretty much all of the line-of-business application systems. Turns out, when done this way, applications work a lot faster, require a lot less maintenance, and are simply easier to write.

Our foundation is open source and is available at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omnigres&#x2F;omnigres">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omnigres&#x2F;omnigres</a>

We&#x27;re backed by some great early-stage VCs and looking to onboard people who can move quickly, learn on the go, and maintain the focus on the goals. Another way to look at it is that we want to meet other pragmatic idealists.
