Vaayu | Remote (European Timezones) | Full-Time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaayu.tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaayu.tech&#x2F;</a>

At Vaayu, we are on a mission to fight climate change. E-commerce has a big climate impact so we are focusing our efforts on helping retailers measure and reduce their carbon emissions. Calculating carbon manually can take months and is very expensive. Our goal is to make carbon analytics easily accessible to every online retailer.

Our automated software is already serving sustainability leaders like Klarna, Wunderman Thompson, Armed Angels or Organic Basics, linking up with shop platforms to deliver the tools necessary for retailers to take charge of their environmental footprint.

We are a distributed company based in Berlin, with an international and diverse team throughout Europe. Last year we closed an $11.5 million seed funding round led by Atomico.

If you are an innovator, want to work at a purpose-driven startup, and would like to collaborate with us in shaping the culture of a growing team on a mission to make a positive impact on our planet, weâ€™d love to hear from you!

Our current stack includes: Golang, JavaScript, Python, Vue.js, D3.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, BigQuery, Kafka, Pub&#x2F;Sub, Google Cloud, Linux, Kubernetes, Docker and Terraform. We are also open to other technologies.

We&#x27;re currently looking for a Golang Software Engineer, more details: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;5f1d82c2teu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;5f1d82c2teu</a>
