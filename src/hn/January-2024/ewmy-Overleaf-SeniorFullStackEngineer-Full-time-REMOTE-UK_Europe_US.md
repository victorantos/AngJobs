Overleaf | Senior Full Stack Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE | UK, Europe, US

Overleaf (www.overleaf.com) builds modern collaborative authoring tools for scientists — like Google Docs for Science. We have over 14 million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language. It’s used by around 500,000 people each day and hosts over 100 million projects.

We’re looking for Senior Full Stack Engineers who are comfortable with backend and a bit of frontend, frontend and a bit of backend, or a balance of both.

Some reasons you’d enjoy working with us:

- Most of our code is open source, so you’ll often be working on open source.

- Remote is a first class citizen; all staff work remotely. We get everyone together 2–3 times each year for valuable face to face time.

- Working hours can be flexible to your needs. Core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time.

- You’ll be working alongside a cross-functional team, including designers, product managers and developers, to help Overleaf become the go-to place for scientific writing.
