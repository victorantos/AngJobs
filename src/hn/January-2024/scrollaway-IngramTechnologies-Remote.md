Ingram Technologies - Remote

Ingram (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ingram.tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ingram.tech&#x2F;</a>) is an AI lab based in Europe. We have a hybrid team with cells in Paris &amp; Brussels, and individuals scattered across 3 continents.

We pride ourselves in getting large companies to transition to AI in ethical, privacy-respecting ways.

We&#x27;re growing rapidly and looking to expand our team in early 2024.
