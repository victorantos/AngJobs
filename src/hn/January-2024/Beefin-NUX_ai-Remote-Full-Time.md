NUX.ai | Remote | Full-Time | Devops&#x2F;MLOps, Backend Engineer (FastAPI), Frontend Engineer (React)

Convert your AI workbooks into a reliable backend with one line of code. NUX contains everything you need to prototype, experiment and productionize AI applications.

We&#x27;re VC-backed and NYC based but remote first. We&#x27;re looking to solve the issue of engineers building cool projects in AI but not knowing how to productionize them. You must be passionate about building production AI systems.

We&#x27;re former AWS, Mongo and Invision engineers.
