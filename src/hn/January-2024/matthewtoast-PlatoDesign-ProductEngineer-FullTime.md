Plato Design - Product Engineer - Full Time - NYC &#x2F; Remote (USA)

We&#x27;re building iOS apps for second language acquisition. If you&#x27;re a full-stack product engineer who wants to use AI and classic NLP to crack the problem of second language acquisition for adults, let&#x27;s talk! This is an early stage startup inventing new kinds of tools, so comfort with trial and error, and the occasional pivot, is essential. If you join us you&#x27;ll spend 90% of your time writing code and report directly to the CTO. As for our tech stack, we build mostly in SwiftUI and TypeScript. We can offer competitive salary, full benefits, and flexible hours. If interested, email mtrost@platodesigninc.com and tell us about (A) why language learning interests you and (B) cool things you&#x27;ve built.
