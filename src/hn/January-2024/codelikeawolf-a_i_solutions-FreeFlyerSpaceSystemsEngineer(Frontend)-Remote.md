a.i. solutions - FreeFlyer Space Systems Engineer (Frontend) - Remote

a.i. solutions is looking to increase the size of our FreeFlyer support team by bringing on a well-spoken engineer passionate about space. Unlike most support teams, the selected engineer will not just be answering questions from our NASA, US Air Force, and commercial customers, they will be on the front lines of helping with every exciting and challenging aerospace design problem involving the FreeFlyer flight dynamics software inside the company.

The chosen candidate will be tasked with mastering the FreeFlyer software, representing the user experience in design meetings, and will be called upon to expertly address challenges posed by customers and our sales team using the tool. Additionally, they will need savvy customer-facing communication skills when traveling to customer sites in the post-pandemic world to instruct them in the optimal usage of the software. The FreeFlyer support team offers a dynamic experience with significant growth potential that may be the ideal fit for a diversely skilled engineer excited to contribute to the future of space. The successful candidate will demonstrate the ability to embrace the a.i. solutions mission and work to continually exceed the expectations of our customers.

We&#x27;re looking for someone with React or Svelte experience.

The only requirements are a Bachelorâ€™s degree in aerospace engineering, physics, mathematics, computer science, or related field and U.S. citizenship.
