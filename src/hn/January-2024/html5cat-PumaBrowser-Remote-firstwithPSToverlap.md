Puma Browser - Remote-first with PST overlap - Engineering &amp; Growth - $75-120k base &amp; 200k+ equity - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.puma.gg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.puma.gg</a>

Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma Browser. I&#x27;ve previously worked in developer relations at Cloudant (YC S08), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11), and explored Ai&#x2F;ML (computer vision for self-driving cars) before diving deep into crypto.

Our mission is making new crypto protocols and LLMs easy to discover and use on your mobile phone. Private by design.

We started with the idea of a privacy-first browser with built-in micropayments (via the Interledger Protocol) and have since added support for identity (HNS, ENS; Unstoppable Domains in testing) and storage (IPFS; Arweave in testing).

We just soft launched OpenAI and Anthropic integrations and looking into ways of running LLaMA-like open source models on device. Come help us prototype and build it.

We recently surpassed 750k downloads and are excited to grow our team. We’ve raised Angel and Seed venture rounds from some of the best builders in crypto and Ai: Protocol Labs, Hard Yaka, Shima Capital, Fenbushi, HashKey, Don Ho (Orange DAO, Quantstamp), Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake, Neeva, Greylock), Jason Warner (ex-GitHub CTO, VP Eng Heroku &amp; Canonical), Illia Polosukhin (NEAR Protocol) and many more.

• We value Optimism, Kindness, Curiosity, Speed and Grit.

• Two recurring weekly meetings to maximize state of flow: Monday all-hands, Friday Demos.

• Careful with growth and never had to do layoffs.

• Capital efficient with 3+ years of runway.

Open Roles: Ai&#x2F;ML Engineer, iOS &amp; macOS Engineer, Browser Extension Engineer, Head of Memes &amp; Growth; Internships: Eng, Design, Growth
