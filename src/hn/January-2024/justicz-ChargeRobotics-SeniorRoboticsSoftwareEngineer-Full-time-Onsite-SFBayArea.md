Charge Robotics | Senior Robotics Software Engineer | Full-time | Onsite | SF Bay Area

Hi HN! We’re a YC-backed startup building robots that build large-scale solar farms. We just got back from the first commercial deployment of our system on a real-world solar construction site (video + more details coming soon!).

It turns out that construction companies literally can&#x27;t build solar fast enough, so what we&#x27;re doing is a crucial part of switching the grid over to renewable generation. We&#x27;re looking to bring another talented software engineer onto our small team.

You’ll be a key contributor, helping bring our next generation of mobile solar factory to life. Your work will involve architecting, developing, and maintaining high-quality code and documentation for our fleet of fully-automated factories

Come work with us if you love:

* Fast-paced prototype development with software and hardware components

* Making a positive climate impact through your work

* Hacking on massive construction equipment!
