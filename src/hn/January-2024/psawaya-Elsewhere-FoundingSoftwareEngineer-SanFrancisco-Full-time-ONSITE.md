Elsewhere - Founding Software Engineer - San Francisco - Full-time - ONSITE

Ever wanted to build indie video games at a startup? Let&#x27;s talk.

Elsewhere is a San Francisco-based company building a new kind of multiplayer social video game, inspired by indie roguelike games like Hades, Dead Cells, and Risk of Rain 2. We&#x27;re backed by top Silicon Valley investors, and graduated from the first cohort of a16z&#x27;s SPEEDRUN program, which is kind of like YC for games.

Ideally, you:

* Have worked as a software engineer before, ideally on a small team.

* Have built and shipped games before, either professionally or on your own time.

* Have experience with a major game engine, such as Unity, Godot, or Unreal.

* Love games yourself, and have always wanted to work in the games industry.

Bonus points if you have experience with backend software development, especially as it pertains to authoritative server multiplayer games.

Your colleagues would include:

* an alum of Supergiant Games who worked on such titles as Pyre, Transistor, and yes, Hades

* a self-taught immersive artist who bootstrapped built a massive creative business on her own

* a repeat entrepreneur who previously cofounded a billion-dollar YC startup

We work in-person out of an office in San Francisco. Relocation assistance is available.
