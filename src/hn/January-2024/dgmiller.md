At Intuitive we design, develop, and manufacture robotic products designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients through minimally invasive surgery, most notably the da Vinci Surgical System.

I lead the software team in the Advanced Product Development group at Intuitive, where we use the cutting-edge technology of today to build the surgical robotics systems of the future. This role is ideal if love working close to the hardware on a technically interesting&#x2F;challenging embedded systems architecture project, and you value making the best possible product that will enhance clinical outcomes for millions of patients.

What to expect:

- Requirements gathering and collaborative embedded system architecture definition

- FPGA-based board bring up and debug

- RTOS virtualization configuration and performance tuning

- HAL-level driver design &amp; updates (e.g. QNX, Linux, FPGA interfaces, PCIe switch)

- Software toolchain integration

- Design and implementation of an instrumented velocity controller, integrated with FMU model

- Develop detailed architecture documentation with performance data
