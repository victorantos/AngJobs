Sidekick Money - Full REMOTE (UK) - Multiple Roles - Full-Time - ~ Â£100k + Stock options -  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidekickmoney.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidekickmoney.com</a>

We&#x27;re an early stage fintech startup working to bring elite wealth building and management facilities to a wider audience, that have up until now only been available to the top 0.1%, (think portfolio line of credit, investing into alternatives). Last year we were authorised by the FCA and subsequently rolled out the initial product to a few founding members just a few weeks ago. We&#x27;re now beginning to gather customer insights from this initial launch and are evolving the product rapidly. There&#x27;s a ton of product to be built and we&#x27;re looking for brilliant minds to build it with us.

We have multiple positions available:

<pre><code>  * Infrastructure Engineers (Terraform, AWS, Cloudflare)
  * Backend Engineers (Python, Temporal, DynamoDB, S3)
</code></pre>
We&#x27;re looking for people who are not afraid to jump into a very deep business domain and work in a highly regulated environment.
