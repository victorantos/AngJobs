Collaborative Drug Discovery | Engineering | Remote | Full-time

We provide a hosted scientific data management system that helps researchers organize, collaborate, and make discoveries faster. Our customers include pharmas, biotechs, and academic labs. We are profitable, loved by our customers[1], and growing.

Experience in biology or chemistry is a plus but by no means required. Our team is small enough that you will have a big impact, but established enough to foster strong engineering practices.
