Biological Software is one or more synthetic molecules that execute complex functions, specified from a program, in a biological system.

We are creating tools to develop increasingly powerful biological software for the rational design of novel, broadly accessible medicines and biotechnologies previously out of reach.

We are hiring for:

* Machine Learning Engineers, Machine Learning Researchers, Scientists, and Entrepreneurs

Our team is globally remote and we also have offices in Palo Alto and Berlin.
