Radiant - Full-time - Onsite (SF) - Software Engineer (Frontend)

Radiant is on a mission to accelerate AI adoption in the enterprise.

We&#x27;re looking for frontend developers with a proven track record of successfully owning and executing against meaningful outcomes in an end-to-end manner. We’re seeking highly motivated individuals who are strong generalists and comfortable flexing beyond core engineering responsibilities into other domains as needed.

As an early member of the Radiant team, you’ll play a key role in defining and establishing foundational aspects of our company, including the product and culture.

We’re hiring individuals in SF. We believe that we do our best work with regular face-to-face interactions and encourage a hybrid schedule.

If this sounds interesting, we’d love to hear from you.
