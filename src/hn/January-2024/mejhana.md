Hello there! I am a software engineer with 4 years of experience in ML, computer vision, and deep generative models. Most recently, I worked with generative models to enable the creation of 3D animations of characters following user-defined paths while performing specific tasks like walking or running. Prior to that, I developed new architectures for predicting energy consumption within the electric vehicle sector.

I am looking for a computer vision or machine learning engineering role. I&#x27;m open to work in either the UK or the US. If you&#x27;re interested in my experience, just drop me a message :)
