PlantingSpace | Full-time | Remote (EU time zone) with quarterly gatherings | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planting.space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planting.space</a>

We are building a system that can accurately represent knowledge and handle uncertainty, to enable the discovery of insights and solve problems based on explainable reasoning. We envision applications to automate analysis and speed up research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more.

We are continuously looking for strong software engineers who are up for a challenge and a steep learning curve. You’ll be exposed to cutting edge research in Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems, information theory, category theory, and more.

Specific skillsets we will be looking for throughout 2024:

- Backend production grade software engineers with experience in developing algorithms

- Bayesian software engineers and researchers

- NLP Engineers with state of the art LLM and up to date transformer model experience

- Infrastructure specialists to build a robust scalable system with machine learning deployments
