Phare Health - Software Engineer - ONSITE - LONDON - Full-time

We build AI tools for the &#x27;back-office&#x27; of healthcare, supporting hospitals to be more efficient and financially resilient. We are an early-stage venture-backed company, with a team split between London and NYC.

Looking for a junior to mid-level SWE (2-5 YoE) to work on cloud microservices, data pipelines, AI model serving, and data security. You will be supported and mentored by senior ex-Google engineers. Background in a high-growth SaaS company is a plus; health-tech experience is not mandatory but nice to have.
