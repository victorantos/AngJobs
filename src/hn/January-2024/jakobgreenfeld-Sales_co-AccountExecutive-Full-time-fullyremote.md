Sales.co | Account Executive | Full-time | fully remote

We&#x27;re a tech-enabled, data-driven lead generation agency that helps startups and SaaS companies through fully managed cold email campaigns + strategy. We are serious about automating all the boring stuff so our team can focus on tasks that require expertise and creativity. Cold email is lindy but at the same time the landscape is changing rapidly. We&#x27;re investing heavily into making sure we&#x27;re always ahead of the curve.

- As an account executive, you&#x27;re responsible for managing client relationships, develop their cold email strategy with us, implement learnings week over week.

- Experience with running cold email campaigns at scale, copywriting, and managing client relationships is a plus but not required.

- No micro management.

- Plenty of room to experiment and test your own ideas.

- We&#x27;re not looking for a cog in the machine but someone with an bias for action, who is able to think on their feet and work independently.
