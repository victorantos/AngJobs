Scope (scopeapp.io) | Senior Software Developer | Full-time | Python | Remote

We&#x27;re hiring 1-2 Senior Software Developers:

Scope is a platform that helps brands find and manage influencers. Works with tools like Klaviyo, Mixmax, Google Sheets, HubSpot, and Shopify.

We started Scope 2018 -6 years ago, never got in to YC (a couple of tries). Been profitable for the past 4 years, grown 90% word of mouth. Team about 10, spread over multiple countries. Customers in 50+ countries. No crazy ipo plans, humble, thoughtful and curious. North star from day 1, listening to customers &amp; building a great product.

Role: Senior Software Developer Stack: Python, Flask, GraphQL, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, AWS-services such as EC2, SQS, Lamda, RDS, Cloudwatch, S3 Frontend: React (TS &amp; GraphQL), Tailwind CSS

Who are we looking for?

You&#x27;re curious and responsible â€“ pragmatic over idealist. You enjoy helping peers but also love to get things done yourself. You&#x27;re looking for a contributor role rather than a manager role. P.S. At Scope, there&#x27;s no need for BS meetings; we have one meeting per week, a product catchup on Tuesdays that has been on the same time since we started.
