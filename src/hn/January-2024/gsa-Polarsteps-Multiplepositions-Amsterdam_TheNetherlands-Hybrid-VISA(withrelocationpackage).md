Polarsteps | Multiple positions | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Full-time (or 4 days&#x2F;week) | Hybrid | VISA (with relocation package) | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.polarsteps.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.polarsteps.com&#x2F;</a>

We&#x27;re an Amsterdam-based team of 50 (and counting) with 20+ nationalities amongst us â€“ a varied, skilled bunch of &quot;Citizens of The World&quot; with hundreds of thousands of kilometers under our travel belts. We also have something important in common (other than our very well-worn passports): We want to change the way people travel.

And that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re doing, with _the_ travel app to plan, track, and relive your journeys in a smart and beautiful way. Our product is at the core of everything that we do, and we always put our users first, so you will always have all the space you need to build things in the best possible way - there&#x27;s a reason why we have a 4.8 star user rating on both Play Store and App Store ;)

We have over 8 million users and with our user base doubling roughly every 12 months we are looking to expand our engineering team to be ready for what&#x27;s coming. More specifically:

- Senior Backend Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.polarsteps.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;senior-backend-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.polarsteps.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;senior-backend-engi...</a>

- Senior DevOps Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.polarsteps.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;senior-devops-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.polarsteps.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;senior-devops-engin...</a>

You can apply there or if you have any questions about the position or company, you can reach me at gagan@polarsteps.com
