Complete Sleep | Senior Frontend Engineer | Full-time | New York, NY | Hybrid (Onsite 3 Days a Week) | $150-170k DOE + equity&#x2F;benefits | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mycompletesleep.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mycompletesleep.com</a>

Complete Sleep is a VC-backed, seed-stage company that is changing the way sleep apnea is tested, diagnosed, and treated so that patients can quickly get the help they need. About 1 in 4 adults has sleep apnea, and 80% of those people haven&#x27;t even been diagnosed.

Our founding team is composed of early-stage veterans in each key area of our business. We care about our patients, the people we work with, and the people in our lives outside of work. Passion for our mission, having fun at work, and enjoying life outside of work are all important to us.

We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer with ~5+ years experience to lead our frontend stack, working closely with our technical CTO. Our stack is built with a Next.js 14 frontend and go backend. We&#x27;re hosted on AWS in Dockerized container and managed via Terraform. We have a stable, well-structured technical environment that is meant to empower engineers to build with quality, performance, and security in mind.

We&#x27;re not legacy healthcare, and we never plan to be. If we&#x27;re going to solve this problem, we have to build things well and transform the way people are treated. Come join us in helping people while building great technology!
