Veritably.ai | 100% Remote, anywhere | Founding engineers sought

Veritably is, as yet, a bunch of prototyping looking to become a company. The grand scheme is to become a general document validation&#x2F;verification automation pipeline. Think, ISO standards compliance.

We are currently a two person team working with VisionEncoder&#x2F;Decoder Models and traditional algorithms (mostly python) to assess the completeness and correctness of documents like ISO 26262 Hazard and Risk assessments.

We are looking for engineers with an interest in document processing, standards compliance, Functional Safety and the like to join us in solving some ugly real world problems. Let&#x27;s face it, modern companies tend to produce documentation in a fairly random mix of &#x27;looks about right&#x27; PDFs and excel (tm) spreadsheets. This is time consuming, tedious work that really could use the application of some intelligent machine processing.

We&#x27;re looking for partners, not employees. If your curious, mail: mark.washeim@veritably.ai
