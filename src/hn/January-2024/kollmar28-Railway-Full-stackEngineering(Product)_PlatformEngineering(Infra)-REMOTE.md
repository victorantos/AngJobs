Railway - Full-stack Engineering (Product), Platform Engineering (Infra) - REMOTE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;railway.app&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;railway.app&#x2F;careers</a>

Tired of trying to beat kube into shape? Does writing YAML to ship code fill you with utter dread? Dream of a future where deploying software is simple, and you don&#x27;t need an army of infrastructure engineers to build that perfect janky bash scriptâ„¢ to make life easy?

We&#x27;re Railway, and we think infrastructure can be better. So far we&#x27;ve built out a platform loved by hundreds of thousands of users who simply tell us &quot;Give me Postgres&quot;, &quot;Deploy this repo&quot;, and we make it happen

Fair warning! The problems are complex: home-rolled hypervisors, cut-above container orchestration, over&#x2F;under&#x2F;whateverlay networks, virtio device drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn&#x27;t suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build it and we&#x27;re looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun.

If that sounds like you, please apply at railway.app&#x2F;careers. We have a number of roles, but are prioritizing the following two roles:

+Full-stack Engineer

+Infrastructure Engineer

See you soon, and happy shipping.
