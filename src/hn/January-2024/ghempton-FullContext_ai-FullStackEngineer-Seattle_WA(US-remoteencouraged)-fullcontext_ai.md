FullContext.ai - FullStack Engineer - Seattle, WA (US-remote encouraged) - fullcontext.ai

FullContext.ai is an early stage startup that is building the first AI-Powered Buyer Copilot. This represents a transformative approach to buyer enablement that helps people understand complex software purchases without having to talk to salespeople. For companies, this helps scale out their sales and marketing efforts and to gain unique insights about potential customers and the market. From an engineering perspective, this means leveraging LLMs in conjunction with a unique set of content to create the closest thing to a live demo of a product without a human on the other side!

The current stack is Typescript, React, Apollo&#x2F;GraphQL, and Nest.js. Everything is built on top of AWS using modern tooling and automation (e.g. pushing a commit will trigger a deployment). This is a great opportunity for a hungry engineer to learn the latest AI technologies and work alongside a team of experienced founders and engineers. Our small team is primarily based out of Seattle, WA, but we work from home 4 out of 5 days and are open to remote team members.
