Sanctuary Computer | NYC OR REMOTE, VISA | Technical Studio Lead

As a Studio Lead at Sanctuary Computer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanctuary.computer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanctuary.computer</a>), you’ll partner with two other Studio Leads to support our project teams, define the strategy of the studio, and lead internal projects to help us achieve our vision. You’ll help cultivate a culture of intellectual curiosity and continuous improvement that empowers us to push the boundary of our technical projects year-over-year.

Based on the responsibilities of this role, we think the right candidate will be a decade or so into their career and will have prior experience in an Engineering Manager role. Maybe they&#x27;ll be a little burned out by Big Tech and intrigued by a worker-first company with profit share and an optional 4-day workweek.
