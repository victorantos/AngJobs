Navix - Senior Software Engineer (Backend or Full Stack) - Remote (U.S.-based), Full-Time

Navix is an early stage logistics startup using ML and automation to streamline freight invoice processing. We accelerate our customers&#x27; cash conversion cycle by working across the full spectrum of shippers, carriers, and intermediaries.

We&#x27;re looking for developers who can help us solve complex problems and take ownership of projects from end-to-end. As we grow, we&#x27;re increasingly focused on resiliency and observability, and are interested in candidates with distributed systems experience. We&#x27;re also working to build out developer-friendly public-facing APIs, and are building integrations to bridge our customers&#x27; data into our system. Our development team moves quickly - we&#x27;ve embraced a short CI&#x2F;CD cycle, and sometimes break (and fix!) things in production.

Our stack is primarily Microsoft-based (C#, .NET, SQL Server, Azure, Angular), but we&#x27;re more focused on finding the right person than a particular skillset. We&#x27;re building an asynchronous and writing-focused culture, and are looking for someone who can be a technical and cultural leader to the engineering team.
