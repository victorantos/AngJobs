Web1on1 | Senior JavaScript Engineer | Remote | Full-time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web1on1.chat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web1on1.chat</a>

Fully remote but tight-knit team operating a messaging platform for the Automotive industry in Europe. Car brands and dealers employ our &#x27;hybrid workforce&#x27; of agents and chatbots to connect to consumers in novel ways.

We run React on the front and Node.js on the back, with lots of chatbots running on Google cloud functions. If you join our team as a full-stack developer, you&#x27;ll help shape our product by building bots and enhancing conversational processes, and strengthening our platform API and SDK.

Requirements: At least 5 years of relevant software engineering experience. Can contribute across the full stack. Independent and autonomous. Clear and consistent communication.

We promise interesting work, lots of freedom and flexible hours. Interested? Reach out to me (the CTO) at peter.dv at web1on1.chat
