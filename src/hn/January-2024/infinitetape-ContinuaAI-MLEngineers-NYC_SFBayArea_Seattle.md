Continua AI - ML Engineers - NYC, SF Bay Area, Seattle - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai</a>

Stack: Python - C# - GCloud - HuggingFace

Continua was founded in April 2023 by a Distinguished Engineer from Google Research to reinvent how people interact with information, with services, and with each other.

We&#x27;re very early; after building several prototypes in our first few months, we’ve developed conviction about an MVP, and we’re building like mad to bring our ideas to users. This is an opportunity to join and help set the product direction of this brand-new company! As an ML engineer, you’d be working on new approaches for knowledge representation, multimodality, and personalization under computational resource constraints.

We’re backed by tier-1 VCs, and we’ve already assembled a team of six engineers with backgrounds at Google, Microsoft, Slack, SpaceX, CourseHero, and Stash.
We have a limited number of additional spots available on the team for engineers who are excited about building innovative products that leverage the latest advances in  Transformers &#x2F; Mamba, RLHF, LoRA&#x2F;QLoRA, at-edge (on-device) training and inference, privacy-first ML, and more. If that sounds like you, we would love to hear from you.

Our ideal candidate is someone who has ongoing projects or published papers in these areas. We all love what we’re working on, therefore if this is already your hobby, you’d fit right in. Are you curious how computers work, tenacious, love working in a community? Are you a competitive ML winner (e.g. Kaggle) or fast.ai enthusiast? Enjoy training local LLMs? If so, please apply via <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.continua.ai&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.continua.ai&#x2F;careers</a> and let&#x27;s embark on this exciting journey together!
