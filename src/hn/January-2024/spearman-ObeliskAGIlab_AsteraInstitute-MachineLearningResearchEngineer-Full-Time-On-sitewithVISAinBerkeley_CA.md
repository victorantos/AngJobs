Obelisk AGI lab, Astera Institute | Machine Learning Research Engineer | Full-Time | On-site with VISA in Berkeley, CA

General Intelligence laboratory that draws on neuroscience and brain architecture to create new models of adaptive intelligence. The Astera Institute is a non-profit dedicated to developing high leverage technologies that can lead to massive returns for humanity.

Visa: As a non-profit research institute, we are exempt from the H1B visa cap so we are willing and able to hire qualified applicants regardless of your nationality.

Compensation: We pay less than e.g., Meta. We pay more cash than the average early VC-backed startup, but there&#x27;s no equity, since we&#x27;re a non-profit.
