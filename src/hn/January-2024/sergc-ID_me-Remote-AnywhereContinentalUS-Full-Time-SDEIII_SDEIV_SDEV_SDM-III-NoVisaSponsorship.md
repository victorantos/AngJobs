ID.me - Remote - Anywhere Continental US - Full-Time - SDE III, SDE IV, SDE V, SDM-III - No Visa Sponsorship

ID.me simplifies how people securely prove and share their identity online. The company empowers people to control their data through a portable and trusted login, which means they donâ€™t need to create a new password when visiting sites that have the ID.me button.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital migration for many critical services. Those services require a trusted identity to safeguard against fraud and help ensure people are who they claim to be. With ID.me, login and identity credentials move with people, which can reduce the time and frustration of having to verify at multiple sites and set up multiple passwords.

ID.me is a credential service provider compliant with federal standards for digital identity verification.
