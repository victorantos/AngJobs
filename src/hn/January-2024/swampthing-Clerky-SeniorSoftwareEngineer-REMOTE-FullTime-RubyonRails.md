Clerky - Senior Software Engineer - REMOTE - Full Time - Ruby on Rails

Clerky is the most popular way for high-growth technology startups to form, and we&#x27;re also used by tons of top-tier startups for hiring and fundraising. We&#x27;re launching powerful enterprise-grade software to helping attorneys and companies collaborate. We&#x27;ve invested a lot in architecture, maintainability, and testing, giving us a significant advantage as we build out functionality that founders and attorneys can currently only dream of.

We could be a good fit for you if you&#x27;re interested in working at a startup (1) without the chaos of a move-fast-and-break-things environment, (2) that&#x27;s small but extremely productive, and (3) that&#x27;s profitable but has tremendous growth potential.
