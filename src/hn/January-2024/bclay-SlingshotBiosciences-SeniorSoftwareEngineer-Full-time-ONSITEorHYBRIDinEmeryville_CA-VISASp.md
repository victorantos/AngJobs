Slingshot Biosciences - Senior Software Engineer - Full-time - ONSITE or HYBRID in Emeryville, CA - VISA Sponsorship

Slingshot Biosciences is a biotech company focused on synthetic cell development. Synthetic cells can have a huge impact—improve the accuracy of biomedical instruments, lower the cost of drug development and diagnostics, and make healthcare more accessible around the world. We’ve raised a Series A round and the company is still small enough to know everyone.

I’m looking for a mission-driven senior software engineer to build out tools for processing and visualizing scientific data. An ideal candidate has worked on a small-to-medium web app before with modern tools. The stack is React, TypeScript, Django, and GCP—full-stack experience is a requirement to be considered for the role but experience with all of those specific tools is not necessary.

You will be a foundational part of the company, building tools scientists will rely on. You will need to come into the office at least once per week to work with scientific instruments and meet with collaborators, but you won’t need to be in daily.
