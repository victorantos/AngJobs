SingleStoreDB (formerly MemSQL) (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;singlestore.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;singlestore.com</a>) | India, Portugal | Full Time | Remote
SingleStoreDB is a database focused on high performance and hybrid workloads (HTAP). Our customers include half of the top 10 US banks, 2 of the top 3 US telcos, and 12% of the Fortune 100.

Our product is a distributed, relational database that handles both transactions and real-time analytics at scale. Querying is done through standard SQL drivers and syntax, leveraging a broad ecosystem of drivers and applications.

We have been building SingleStore since 2011, and building a database-as-a-service product involves a bunch of interesting technical challenges such as: * Compilers and code generation

* Distributed computing and fault tolerance

* UI and User Experience

* Integrations with connectors and third-party tools (e.g., Business Intelligence tools like Tableau)

* Infrastructure that scales to dozens of thousands of database clusters across GCP, Azure and AWS

We have the following positions open:

* Senior Platform Engineer (India)

* Partner Integration Engineer (Portugal, India)
