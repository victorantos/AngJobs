Minerva Project - Senior Full Stack Engineer - Full time - REMOTE (global, EU or Middle East preferred) - 120-205k USD + Equity

Minerva prepares students for leadership and innovation across all disciplines. We integrate advanced classroom technology with research-backed pedagogy and curriculum to help institutions of all types and sizes to improve learning outcomes for their students, including Minerva University, our accredited four-year undergraduate institution which has been ranked Ranked #1 Most Innovative University in the World.

We have a full-time, fully remote team of 12 engineers, with a few planned hours of overlap in the AM for the US west coast time zone. Salaries are based on role, not location, providing a great amount of flexibility for employees wishing to move&#x2F;travel. We believe in work life balance, flexible work arrangements, close collaboration, and start-to-finish ownership. Everyone is included in our planning process and gets a voice. Our stack is Django, React, and NodeJS on Kubernetes.

Youâ€™d be joining as a full-stack engineer helping to build the next generation of Minerva Forum, our online &amp; in-person classroom learning solution. While every engineer works on every part of the stack, there is ample opportunity for specialization, or to broaden your skill in areas new to you. For all roles, we value empathy, candor, substantive feedback, fast iteration loops, and openness to experimentation over a specific software development process.

We do our best to reach out to every applicant. Visit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;minerva-project.breezy.hr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;minerva-project.breezy.hr&#x2F;</a> to learn more and apply.
