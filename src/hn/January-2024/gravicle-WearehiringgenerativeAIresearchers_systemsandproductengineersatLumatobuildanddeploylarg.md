We are hiring generative AI researchers, systems and product engineers at Luma to build and deploy large multimodal video models. We are also hiring head of engineering, head of marketing and for creative roles.

We are a small group of researchers, engineers and designers, have raised $70 million so far, including Series B recently from a16z, and have 2 million users (and growing FAST). We most of all value strong engineering&#x2F;research skills, autonomy, and great communication. We have an office in Palo Alto, but also hire remote.
