Sourcetable is hiring a Staff level engineer (Python + React) to build a spreadsheet-based data platform.

We are an 8-person hybrid-remote team. Half the team is SF-bay-area, the other half are remote. Remote applicants must be US-based.

We have an Excel&#x2F;Sheets competitor coming to market, have raised a seed round, are an experienced team with prior success, plenty of hard engineering problems to solve, as well as some fun AI stuff cooking under the hood that we&#x27;re not ready to announce.

Culturally, we really like working with experienced people who are ex-founders and&#x2F;or early stage employees. It just seems to work better that way.

More info here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com&#x2F;jobs</a>
You can also email me (Eoin, founder) at Sourcetable.com

Have a great day!
