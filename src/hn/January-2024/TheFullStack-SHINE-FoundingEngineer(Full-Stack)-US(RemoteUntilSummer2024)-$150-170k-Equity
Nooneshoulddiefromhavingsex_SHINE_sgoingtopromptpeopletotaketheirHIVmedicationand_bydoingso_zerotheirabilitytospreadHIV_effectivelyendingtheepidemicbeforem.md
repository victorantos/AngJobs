SHINE | Founding Engineer (Full-Stack) | US (Remote Until Summer 2024) | $150-170k | Equity
No one should die from having sex. SHINE’s going to prompt people to take their HIV medication and, by doing so, zero their ability to spread HIV, effectively ending the epidemic before moving to many other diseases and extending millions, maybe billions, of lives.

This is the second company for our two Co-Founders, who have built together for the last 8 years, creating the most effective HIV testing organization in the US. One, our CEO, was recently sworn into President Biden’s HIV Council, and the other, our CMO, recently completed his medical residency at Harvard.

You’ll be our third teammate and first engineer. We’re early stage (finalizing our pre-seed round now), and you’ll have heavy impact on the technical roadmap of the product. We like to live in the intersection of helping people and having fun; love messing around, but are never messing around, and have a long track record of building industry newests and bests. We’re excited to build, learn, and grow together with a phenomenal new teammate. Here is our current technical stack:

- Frontend: React JS, Tailwind, TypeScript, Vite

- Backend: NestJS, Prisma ORM, Auth0, Docker

- Server&#x2F;DevOps: Ubuntu, NGINX, CI&#x2F;CD, Kubernetes (nice to have),

We are glad you found us! :)
