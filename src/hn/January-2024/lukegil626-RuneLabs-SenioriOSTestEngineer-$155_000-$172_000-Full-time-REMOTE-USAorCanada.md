We&#x27;re hiring a Senior iOS Test Engineer to work on StrivePD, a healthcare app that helps people with Parkinson&#x27;s manage their disease, and pharma companies develop therapies (the buzzword is &quot;Precision Neurology&quot;).

We want someone who can craft a high-level test strategy, while also getting into the weeds of validating day-to-day development.

Our workplace: Pay transparency; Work-life balance; Remote with a small office in SF (though most of the dev team is outside of SF).
