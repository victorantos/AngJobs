We&#x27;re a small team of repeat founders and seasoned operators on a big mission to simplify planet-positive investing and put power in the hands of impact investors at a scale never seen before. The next generation of tools we are building use AI to interact with the world of sustainability data (large language models like ChatGPT). This is a highly specialist crew with a decade or more of relevant experience in the domains of machine learning and climate finance.

Some of the companies we started, (e.g. Secondmind), scaled to 100+ people and millions in revenue, published extensively in key academic journals in machine learning, and won national awards. We also have extensive industry networks, published works, and numerous advisory and working group seats in climate and sustainable finance.

We&#x27;re looking for people to play a foundational role on this big mission:

- Mid-Senior Backend Engineer (Python)

- (Research) ML Engineer (LLMs)

- Others (opportunistic, including internships)

We have raised our pre-seed round from top European climate-focused investors (Pale Blue Dot &amp; Frontline Ventures) and we just did a private product launch at COP28 in December. We&#x27;ve always built high-performing teams where everyone is excited to come to work for the team and to make an impact on the mission. Further details are available on our Notion job page (link at the start) and our website!

I&#x27;m the CEO and co-founder â€” if interested, drop me an email (aleksi@) or email our jobs email (jobs@). It&#x27;ll come to me either way! :)
