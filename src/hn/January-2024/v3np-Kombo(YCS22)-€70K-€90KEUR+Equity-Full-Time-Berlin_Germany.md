Kombo (YC S22) - €70K - €90K EUR + Equity - Full-Time - Berlin, Germany - ONSITE
Kombo builds a unified API for HR, payroll and recruiting systems. We&#x27;re working with companies of all sizes - from Fortune 500 companies down to early stage startups - to help them integrate dozens of software vendors within a few days instead of months.

Reasons you might want to work at Kombo - Modern, yet robust tech stack (TypeScript, Prisma, tRPC, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes)

- Extremely high bar for talent - backgrounds from Oxford, Harvard, TUM, CODE; 50% of employees are ex-founders

- Grew from 4 to 14 people within a year, and looking to 2.5x next year as well

- Early enough to make a significant contribution and have the &#x27;early stage&#x27; startup&#x27; feeling; late enough to be significantly derisked (we are already profitable)

- Strong onsite culture in hip Berlin office

- Competitive salaries and equity compensation

We&#x27;re looking for senior engineers to join us in various positions and are actively hiring! :) We are into radical candor, shipping code fast and sometimes being a bit crazy.
