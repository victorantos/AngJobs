Monochrome - Backend Engineers - Full-Time - Motely remote but sometimes onsite (Tokyo&#x2F;Kanagawa in Japan) -

At Monochrome Inc., we are designing and developing next-generation smart homes. Our vision is to transform houses so we make the living experience sustainable and yet convenient. We have two product lines. 
One is Roof-1 which is a solar panel, and unlike the conventional solar panels, the color and texture of the module is well-designed so it’s hard to distinguish the roof and module. Architectural designers in Japan love that appearance, and we have high demand since last year.
Another product is Home-1 which is a built-in IoT system: automated lighting, curtains, heating and cooling, smart locks, distribution board, and more, all preconfigured to work out-of-the-box. Best of all, you’ll have seamless control of your home through our beautiful UI, which you can access through a touchscreen built into the house or through your phone.

We are seed-stage Tokyo startup (will have the series-A round soon) with a top-tier international team. If you’re passionate about making a big impact in smart homes, automation, or the environment, this is the place for you.
We’ll offer stock options for new hires.

We’re looking for people who can build systems to control and automate IoT system via bluetooth, WiFi, or wired connections. We usually use Golang and Python, but we’re very flexible and open to choose any technology if it makes sense to use. We use Debian as a central controller, so this position requires knowledge of Linux systems. It&#x27;s preferable if you have the basic knowledge&#x2F;skill of web development, such as RDS&#x2F;NoSQL and HTTP&#x2F;socket.io communications.

Some of our employees have relocated to Tokyo and the company can support relocation and VISA. 
Remote work is welcome in this company, and most developers are working remotely, but it’s necessary for this role to sometimes go onsite and check how devices work with your programs.

If you have any questions or wish to apply for the position, please send an email to so[at]monochrome.so with your inquiries or your resume. Thank you.
