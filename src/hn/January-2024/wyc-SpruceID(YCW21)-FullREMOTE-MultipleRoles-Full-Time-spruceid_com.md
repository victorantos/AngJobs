SpruceID (YC W21) - Full REMOTE - Multiple Roles - Full-Time - spruceid.com

Spruce lets users control their data across the web. We are creating the worldâ€™s best open source software for user-centric digital identity. Instead of users logging into platforms, we think platforms should request to access data vaults controlled by users.

We hire programmers who love technology and are committed to intellectual honesty, user privacy, and innovation. Our products are composed from a combination of industry-trusted frameworks, applied cryptography, new interoperable identity standards (W3C, ISO&#x2F;IEC, IETF, and OpenID), and custom backend libraries.

Select roles:

Senior Product Manager: Help drive the growth of a new product family which empowers government agencies and enterprises to manage the entire lifecycle of digital credentials for a wide range of use cases. This role will be responsible for developing product vision, roadmap, user stories, timelines, and implementation strategy.

Software Engineer, Android: Build software prototypes and product features from start to finish for Android and iOS, embedding our Rust core.
