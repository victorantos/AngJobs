Mechanic Advisor | Remote | Latin America | Full-time | Senior Platform Engineer - Kubernetes, AWS - LATAM

Mechanic Advisor offers a market-leading CRM ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steercrm.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steercrm.com</a> ) suite for automotive repair shops, complete with text messaging, email automation, direct mail integration, reputation management, appointment reminders, declined&#x2F;recommended services, and many other features.

We have a large, modern infrastructure but there&#x27;s a lot of growth, scaling, automating, new solutions and improvements to do.

You <i>must</i> have extensive, senior-level experience with:

- Kubernetes (EKS preferred) - you have, as primary contributor, created and operated multiple 24&#x2F;7, production, high-traffic, non-trivial k8s-based infrastructures

- AWS

- Terraform

- CI&#x2F;CD (Github Actions preferred)

- a modern programming language (Go preferred)

- working fully remotely in a startup environment

You must be located in Latin America and be a confident communicator.

The successful candidate will join our small Platform Engineering Team and get to work with a diverse suite of technologies, wear many hats or other job post cliches. It&#x27;s a very busy environment and you need to be comfortable with autonomous work, changing priorities, ad-hoc requests and owning the delivery.

This is a fully remote, no travel required position. We have very few meetings, we&#x27;re light on process, with mostly flat hierarchy.

If you&#x27;re a truly senior Platform Engineer please email your resume to senior_platform_engineer___remote_cde699be7us@kelp.greenhouse.io

Keywords: Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Go
