The construction industry, with its complex projects, workforce and operations, stands as one of the last frontiers of digital revolution. For decades, construction firms have grappled with the challenges of job costing, payments, accounting and regulatory hurdles, often using disjointed systems and manual processes. These inefficiencies not only affect the bottom line but also impede the industry&#x27;s evolution.

Our vision is not just to introduce another tool into this mix but to craft a holistic solution tailored specifically for constructionâ€”a unified platform driven by the unparalleled capabilities of generative AI.

Responsibilities:

* End-to-End Development: From ideation to deployment, be involved in every aspect of the platform&#x27;s development, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and reliability.

* AI Integration: Collaborate closely with team members to integrate generative AI functionalities and fine-tune the system&#x27;s adaptive learning capabilities. Generative AI sits at the core of our platform

* Stack Management: Develop and manage our AWS&#x2F;CDK infrastructure, Spring Boot&#x2F;Java backend, and React&#x2F;typescript frontend.

* Database Expertise: Oversee the integration and management of our Postgres databases, ensuring data integrity, security, and swift retrievals.

* Iterative Development: Adapt and evolve with our ever-changing product roadmap, implementing new features, and refining existing ones based on feedback and industry needs.

* Collaboration: Work cross-functionally with product managers, designers, and other engineers to ensure our platform remains cohesive and aligned with our overarching vision.

Requirements:

* Ideally 5+ years of experience in developing and deploying scalable platforms.
