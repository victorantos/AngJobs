Aerodome is revolutionizing public safety air support with cutting-edge drone technology. Our AI-driven operating system offers unparalleled, 24&#x2F;7 drone-as-first-response capabilities to public safety agencies worldwide.

We&#x27;re looking for Rust engineers to solve the interesting problems involved in aerial automation. You&#x27;ll work on real-time communication, video streaming (WebRTC), computer vision, distributed systems, aerial traffic awareness, and more, including state-of-the-art hardware like radars, docking stations, and new airframes.

We are well capitalized (repeat founders, top-tier investors) and are looking for engineers who want to join us on the ground floor (&lt;20 people in product engineering).

Our team is fully remote, but we&#x27;re looking for candidates in the US only. We&#x27;re also open to contract-to-hire arrangements. No visa sponsorship at this time.
