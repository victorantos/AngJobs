Count | Senior Software Engineer | REMOTE within UK&#x2F;Europe | Full-time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;count.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;count.co</a>

Count is like Jupyter, Tableau and Miro combined in one tool. Data teams at some of the world&#x27;s leading scale-ups use it for everything from iterating data models to performing deep dive analyses and telling impactful stories backed by data.

We&#x27;re a small team looking for experienced software engineers who are interested in tackling deep technical challenges in the data analytics space.

For the best possible user experience, we have developed various technologies in-house, including a custom WebGL rendering engine, our own data visualization library, and a reactive SQL&#x2F;Python notebook and database query framework.

Example projects: accelerating rendering using quadtree tiling, extending interactivity and customizability of visualizations, leveraging LLMs in data exploration, serverless framework for executing database queries at high concurrency.

Our tech stack: TypeScript, Python, Node, WebAssembly, WebGL, Apache Arrow, DuckDB, Kubernetes, React.
