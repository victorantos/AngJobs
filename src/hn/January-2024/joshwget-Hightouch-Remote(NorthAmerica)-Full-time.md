Hightouch -Remote (North America)-Full-time - Frontend &amp; Backend Engineers

Some background on Hightouch - our mission is to help companies leverage their customer data to grow. We started with the problem of “Reverse ETL” or helping companies sync data from their data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake, Databricks, etc.) to 200+ SaaS tools (Salesforce, Marketo, Facebook Ads, etc.) without coding. Since then, we’ve evolved into a suite of tools around the warehouse (identity resolution, data enrichment, event streaming, etc.). We’ve raised a Series B and scaled to $15m+ ARR in 3 years with 500+ customers including Fortune 500 co’s like Spotify, the NBA, PetSmart, etc.

We are hiring for:
