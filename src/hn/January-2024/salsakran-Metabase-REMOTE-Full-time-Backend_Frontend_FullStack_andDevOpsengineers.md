Metabase - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metabase.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metabase.com</a> - REMOTE - Full-time - Backend, Frontend, Full Stack, and DevOps engineers

Metabase is open source analytics software that lets anyone in your company rummage around in the databases you have. It connects to a number of databases &#x2F; data warehouses (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, Postgres, MySQL, etc).

People rather like the product (metabase.com&#x2F;love). We&#x27;re a remote team full of people who care about user experience, making complicated things as simple as possible and building things. We have a deeply pragmatic engineering culture and value building things that people actually use vs whatever closes a deal or makes for a good press release.

Tech stack: Clojure, Typescript, React, Redux, AWS

Roles: Engineering Managers, Data Analysts, Frontend&#x2F;DevOps&#x2F;Backend Engineering, Success Engineers, and more.
