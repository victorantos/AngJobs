WattCarbon | Full Time | REMOTE (US) | Data Engineer (Python) | $130k-$145k + equity

WattCarbon has launched the first clean energy market aimed at rapidly scaling distributed energy technology, including rooftop solar &amp; storage, electrification, and demand response. Our buildings are responsible for 40% of US and global emissions. By scaling distributed clean energy, we can eliminate these emissions today. We partner with climate-driven companies &amp; organizations, directing funding towards these technologies to lower costs, accelerate deployment, and promote energy equity across the US.

We are a seed stage startup backed by some of the most respected climate investors on the planet (True Ventures, Jetstream, Village Global, Looking Glass, Keiki Capital, Greensoil PropTech Ventures, and others); you would be the fourth engineer and eighth team member. We are open to any applicant who lives in the US - you should be comfortable working in a fully distributed, remote-first company.

Data Engineer: We are looking for someone to help with the development of the ETL pipeline for the ingestion of electricity meter data and an array of other diverse datasets used in the measurement and verification of decarbonization programs. We are looking for help building out a pipeline that ingests and computes models using hourly meter data on the scale of millions of meters. Our ideal applicant is a python-first programmer who is also experienced in pandas. Work will also entail supporting data science related to measurement and verification. Previous experience with energy data is a plus.

We generally subscribe to the idea that Marx was correct about the alienation of labor and we organize ourselves purposefully to provide flexibility around family commitments, ensure opportunities for substantive input into business decisions, and prioritize personal growth. We are committed to a more inclusive approach to employment in tech through benefits and paid leave policies that are compatible with a diversity of personal and family situations through flexible work hours.
