Dear community! 
We are looking for Lisp developers to include in our projects in #RatherLabs. I know that between all of us we can get the ball rolling and it will surely reach whoever is actively searching.

This is a decentralized exchange (DEX) project that allows users to trade and earn with Bitcoin without relying on central points of failure, replacing malicious intermediaries with PSBTs, Atomic Swaps, layer 2 smart contracts, sBTC and decentralized liquidity pools - unlocking the full potential of Bitcoin. 
The requirements we are assessing are as follows: 
- Clarity
- Lisp + Python or Lisp only
- Typescript

Those who are interested can contact me via:
mail: mayra@ratherlabs.com

Thank you and good luck in your projects!
