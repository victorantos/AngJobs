Our World In Data (YC W19) | Senior Full Stack Engineer | Full-Time | Remote

At Our World In Data (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org</a>), our mission is to make the world&#x27;s biggest problems understandable, so that we can take effective action on them. We publish research and data on crucial topics like poverty, disease, hunger, inequality, war and climate change.

We want to improve several aspects of our site in the coming years, with a particular focus this year on making it easier to author and share smaller formats than our long articles, and creating a more unified way to explore our most complex data sources. Our tech stack is a Jamstack site built using Typescript, React, MySQL and Cloudflare services with a Python based data pipeline on the data side.

We are a remote-first team that operates on EU timezones. As a team, we&#x27;re also passionate, talented, and driven to do work that makes a difference.
