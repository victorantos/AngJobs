National Journal | Django&#x2F;Python Web Developer | Washington, DC | Full-time | FULLY REMOTE or HYBRID OPTION (3 days&#x2F;week onsite) | $100K+ | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationaljournal.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationaljournal.com</a>

National Journal helps government affairs professionals stay informed about key movements in people, politics, and policy using journalism, tools, and in­tel­li­gence. Our digital platform is built around a rich set of election and campaign finance data, demographic information, profiles of policymakers, editable slides, government directories, and our decades of non-partisan journalism. Election years are huge for our members (and for us) and 2024 is going to be busy and exciting.

Tech Stack: We use a Python 3&#x2F;Django back-end with a Vue.js&#x2F;TypeScript front-end (for our newest tools) and traditional Django views for our more established resources. Our devs are full-stack or front-end specialists and our projects are most often back-end focused (Python&#x2F;Django). Other technologies in our world include Elasticsearch, Docker, Azure, Postgres, Jenkins, Pandas, and Less. We follow a frequent release cycle that lets us bring enhancements to our users in a matter of days.

We&#x27;re a small team with good people, solid work-life balance, and interesting problems to solve. Apply or read more at:
