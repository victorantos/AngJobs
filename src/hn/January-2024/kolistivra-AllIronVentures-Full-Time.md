All Iron Ventures | Tech Lead&#x2F;Senior Full-Stack Engineer | REMOTE (Europe &#x2F; Middle East &#x2F; Africa) with 2 days each month in Spain | Full-Time

All Iron is a European early stage venture capital firm based in Bilbao. With ~€300M under management, we invest in Seed and Series A startups across Europe. So far, we have invested in 50+ companies including success stories like JobandTalent, Seedtag, TuLotero or Preply amongst others and our graduation rates place us in the industry’s top quartile.

Venture investing is no longer a domestic and (only) relationship-based business. Modernising how venture firms work is a key competitive advantage, that here at All Iron sits at the core of how we do things. We are building our very own tool, Pareto, which is becoming the most relevant platform for the investment team’s day to day. In the last twelve months, Pareto has allowed us to gain a competitive advantage in a very competitive market by both saving time and identifying interesting companies ahead of our peers.

If you are passionate about building product to significantly improve how we run our day to day, using large amounts of data (to identify interesting companies to potentially invest in) and want to join an entrepreneurial firm, you will not be disappointed!

What are we looking for:

* 3+ years experience as a Data Engineer or Full-stack Engineer

* Someone who is a self-starter, scrappy, and pragmatic

* Experience in Google cloud, Django, JavaScript &#x2F; TypeScript with React, SQL and Spark

* Experience as a tech lead or an Engineering manager is a plus: we have an external team of engineers whom you’ll be working closely with

* Experience working at a small startup and&#x2F;or as a solo engineer is a plus

* Ability to travel to Bilbao (Spain) ~2 days each month is a must
