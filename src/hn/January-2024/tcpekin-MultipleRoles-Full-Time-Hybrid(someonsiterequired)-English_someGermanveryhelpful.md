Carl Zeiss SMT&#x2F;SMS - Jena&#x2F;Oberkochen&#x2F;Rossdorf &amp; remote, Germany - Multiple Roles - Full-Time - Hybrid (some onsite required) - English, some German very helpful - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zeiss.de&#x2F;semiconductor-manufacturing-technology&#x2F;home.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zeiss.de&#x2F;semiconductor-manufacturing-technology&#x2F;...</a>

Zeiss SMT is the leader in extreme engineering optics for semiconductor manufacturing. We come up every so often on HN as leaders in EUV optics manufacturing for ASML scanners. SMS is a branch of SMT concerned with standalone tooling for quality assurance and defect inspection in semiconductor fabs (tools like the AIMS EUV or PROVE systems, for example). We bring complete solutions to the hypercompetitive market that is the semiconductor industry. The scale is vast – the work you can be involved in ranges from simulations at the nanometer to how to ship tools via using Boeing 747(s).

Software (and extremely diligent&#x2F;precise engineering… honestly it blows my mind regularly) underpins everything we do and spans the same vastness of scale. We (Zeiss SMT, but also SMS where I work) are hiring in pretty much every IT field as we modernize systems, upgrade legacy code, and build cutting-edge new tools and platforms to remain at the front of the field. Specifically interesting to HN (I think) is my team, which works on developing extremely fast physics simulation and data processing code utilizing classical algorithms, machine learning, and _AI_, all on premise. We also build and maintain the hardware (HPC clusters) to enable these developments.

Desirable skills
Python (scientific, HPC, ML, physics simulation), image analysis (big, big data processing, very fast), CUDA, C++, HPC architecture design&#x2F;on premise rack configuration, HPC admin, DevOps infrastructure (physical as well as CI&#x2F;CD), GPGPU programming, FPGA programming, QA engineering, Kubernetes

I can post some job links tomorrow, but if you have questions please either comment or reach out to me at thomas dot pekin at zeiss dot com. I’ve been working here for a year and it’s a lot of fun.
