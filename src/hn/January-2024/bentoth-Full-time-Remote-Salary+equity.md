Molin AI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;molin.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;molin.ai</a>) - Full-time - Remote - UK &amp; Europe - Salary + equity

Startup = growth -&gt; we are growing 7%+ every week.

Today, Molin is a conversational AI chatbot designed specifically for ecommerce businesses. Molin cuts shops’ customer support volume by 70% and also increases their sales.

In the last few months, we built an app that can create high-quality AI chatbots instantly from just the shop’s URL. The chatbots are powered by LLMs and can also take actions on demand, such as collecting emails from leads or canceling orders.

Our short-term goal is to build the best AI that can manage the entire sales and support system of ecommerce businesses using multiple mediums and channels.

We just closed our pre-seed round and well-funded for the next 16 months. We are 7 people today and remote first.

We are looking to grow the team with a senior software engineer who has extensive web experience and knows a thing or two about LLMs.

If you are interested or just want to chat, contact me at ben at molin dot ai.  I&#x27;m also down to grab a coffee if you&#x27;re currently in London.
