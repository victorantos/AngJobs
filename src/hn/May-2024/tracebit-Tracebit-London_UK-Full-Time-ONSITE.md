Tracebit | London, UK | Full-Time | ONSITE

Founding Engineer | £70-100k + equity

Tracebit is on a mission to reduce the global mean time to detect and contain security incidents from months to minutes. 
The two founders are building on their experience at Tessian to vastly improve an organisation’s cloud security (and beyond). On the back of a successful seed fundraise, we are looking to hire the first 5 engineers to join our founding team.

You&#x27;ll be responsible for:

<pre><code>  * Working across the entire tech stack (C#, .NET Core 8, Terraform, HTMX)
  * Contributing to a scalable and secure architecture
  * Working closely with the CTO and a team of exceptional engineers
</code></pre>
You&#x27;re a great fit if you:

<pre><code>  * Have experience shipping software at scale
  * Enjoy working in a fast-paced, early-stage startup environment
  * A love of getting things done and having fun
</code></pre>
Bonus points for:

<pre><code>  * Experience in cloud security, ideally at a Product focused company and&#x2F;or working with at least 1 of the public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
</code></pre>
