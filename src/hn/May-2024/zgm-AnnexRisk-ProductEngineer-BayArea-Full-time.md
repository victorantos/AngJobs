Annex Risk - Product Engineer - Bay Area - Full-time

The cost of homeowners insurance, especially in natural catastrophe heavy areas, has skyrocketed in recent years. Annex Risk is solving this problem with better digital infrastructure for executing the transaction. Our platform enables insurance agents to quote and bind policies within 90 seconds vs. the current multi-day phone&#x2F;email&#x2F;fax-based transaction that is the status quo.

We recently closed our seed round, are growing 30-100% month over month, and we&#x27;re looking for a full-stack product engineer to be our first engineering hire. The ideal candidate has experience designing and shipping product features end-to-end in a fast-paced environment.

What will you get to build?

- Extensions to our core platform to integrate with additional carrier partners

- Improvements to our agent portal and API infrastructure

- A consumer portal to allow insureds to access their docs, make payments, and request policy changes

Our tech stack is primarily Scala (Finatra + Finagle!), Javascript (React + Retool), and Temporal.
