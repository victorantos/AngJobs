We are the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, at the University of Oxford, led by Professor Ben Goldacre (of “Bad Science” fame). We built OpenSAFELY, a revolutionary open source platform for secure clinical research. Conceived at the start of the COVID-19 crisis, it is used to produce ground-breaking research using a huge corpus of patient data which is not available anywhere else in the world.

We’re hiring for software developers at all levels, as well as tech lead and product management roles.

Tools we use include Python (and Django), Javascript (and React), Docker, Postgres, SQLite and HTMX. Our entire platform is open-source:
