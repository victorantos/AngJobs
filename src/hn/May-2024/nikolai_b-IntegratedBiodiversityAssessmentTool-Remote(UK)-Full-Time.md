The Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) is an partnership of top conservation charities &#x2F; NGOs (IUCN, UN Environment Program) that have the gold standard of biodiversity datasets.   IBAT then uses the datasets, mixed with the best conservation science, to help companies understand&#x2F;reduce their impact on nature and they help fund conservation, it&#x27;s a win-win.
