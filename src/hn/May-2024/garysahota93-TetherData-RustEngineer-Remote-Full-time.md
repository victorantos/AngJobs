Tether Data (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetherdata.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetherdata.io&#x2F;</a>) is a no-code data movement &#x2F; ETL platform built for operations leaders in Go-To-Market orgs (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, etc).

We are looking for a skilled Rust engineer to join our team. Our entire platform is built on a service-oriented architecture (in Rust), but we are looking for someone with the following experience:

- Non-US preferred (ideally Central or South America, but US, EU &amp; Asia is okay)

- ~5+ years of experience (ideally can share examples of Rust projects)

- Comfortable working with a fully distributed team (we&#x27;re all over North &amp; South America)

- Experience with any sort of ETL&#x2F;Data products or GTM applications is preferred, but not required
