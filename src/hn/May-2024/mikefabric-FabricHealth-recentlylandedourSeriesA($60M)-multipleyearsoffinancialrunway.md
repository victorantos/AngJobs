Fabric Health - recently landed our Series A ($60M) - multiple years of financial runway

Site Reliability Engineers (Remote US) - Kubernetes &#x2F; Terraform, building secure and scalable infra and tooling | Ideally Computer Science track, not IT&#x2F;SysAd track

Staff Backend&#x2F;Fullstack (Hybrid NYC) strong Python or Node required | Must have at least 7 years of software engineering experience| MongoDB is a plus

Rather than Patients and Providers struggling with fragmented experiences and antiquated tech&#x2F;processes, Fabric delivers a seamless approach to care delivery through a hybrid end-to-end experience (from onset across navigation, intake, triage, treatment, and workflow automation and beyond). We are already live with ~70 healthcare systems and growing a ton!

Fabric offers competitive base &#x2F; bonus &#x2F; equity, excellent benefits as well Fabric has at least 3-4 years of financial runway (just received a $60M Series A led by General Catalyst &#x2F; Google Ventures &#x2F; Thrive Capital) *Fabric has an excellent engineering-first culture and is led by a team of medical experts leaning on great software engineering practices to build the best systems for everyone touching healthcare systems
