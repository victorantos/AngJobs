Accounting Manipulation &amp; Impact Washing Detection AI – CTO Co-Founder

I’m currently building an accounting manipulation and impact washing detection AI platform. This will be used by investors (banks and asset managers), auditors, legal advisors and corporates to support them with their analysis and abilities to manage risk and generate alpha.

We are searching for a co-founder to join us as a Chief Technology Officer. 
Ideally he&#x2F;she would be familiar with machine learning algorithms and data handling techniques, as well as having programming and NLP skills and software engineering principles.

Our Chief Product Officer is a veteran in the forensic accounting and finance world, and I have built and exited financial services businesses in the past.

If you’d be interested in joining us or know anyone else that may be interested please let me know.
