Antithesis is a completely new approach to testing and debugging. Our platform continuously searches your software for problems, within a simulated environment where every problem can be perfectly reproduced, enabling efficient debugging of the most complex issues.

This year is very exciting as we are actively productizing some unpolished areas and releasing new features every month.
