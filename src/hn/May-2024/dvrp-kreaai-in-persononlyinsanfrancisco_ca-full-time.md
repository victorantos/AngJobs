i&#x27;m diego, cofounder and cto at krea.

we are building a professional tool that lets creatives use ai.

we are hiring exceptional software engineers who also have taste and an appreciation for beauty. we&#x27;re focusing on building a delightful interface for creative ai and that&#x27;s why we need you. our team is tiny (7 incl. founders), but we work tirelessly; we are all programming most of the time.

no ai experience required—since we already have folks who know their NNs—but it&#x27;s a nice bonus.

happy to share more financial details, but pls first send a high-quality application to my email: d at krea dot ai.
