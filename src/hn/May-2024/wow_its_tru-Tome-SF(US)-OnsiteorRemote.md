Tome revolutionizes contract understanding using LLMs fine-tuned on contract domain knowledge. For users, we decode complex contracts into simple reports, so everyone can understand their rights and make informed decisions. We are a team of 8, with a 4.5 person engineering team, backed by top VC firms, and we&#x27;re poised to transform the $400B legal industry.

Join us as a Senior Full Stack Engineer to build out our core product UI, our AI backend, and our RLHF internal tooling. We have tons of legal problems (the good kind), tons of AI problems (also the good kind), and most interesting, the intersection between the two. We&#x27;re working on graph visualizations of legal information - come help!

Ideal candidate: has worked in a startup, or independently led projects; 5+ years of frontend development experience; Experience with complex data visualizations; and bonus points if you like writing full end-to-end tests, improving CI pipelines, or implementing pretty color gradients.

<i>Tech Stack:</i>

- Next.js (all-in on the Vercel ecosystem), Python, Postgres, AWS

Benefits: early-stage startup growth opportunities; competitive pay and comprehensive benefits; use of a collection of 10,000,000 board games; home office stipend; use of the company jet* (*when acquired)

We are committed to diversity and encourage applications from underrepresented groups.
