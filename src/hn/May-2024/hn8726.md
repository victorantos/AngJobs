I applied a while ago, the application form was pretty long and detailed, and I received only a &quot;sorry you didn&#x27;t get in&quot; email, no details or anything. I may just not be worth even a chat with recruiter, although (obviously) I consider myself a good candidate. Is there any cooldown period for when it&#x27;s OK to apply again? Can I re-apply without filling in the whole form again (I didn&#x27;t get a copy)?

Btw you also post similar roles on every whoishiring thread as well as other avenues regularly. It looks like roles stay unfilled for months â€” is that it, there&#x27;s turnaround or the team is just growing constantly and you actually hire continuously?
