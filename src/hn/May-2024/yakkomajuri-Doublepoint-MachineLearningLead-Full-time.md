Doublepoint - Helsinki &#x2F; Remote - Machine Learning Lead - Full-time

We&#x27;re creating cutting edge gesture detection algorithms for smartwatches and have recently started looking for an experienced ML Engineer to lead our ML team.

We currently have a tap model (think Apple double tap) that is world-class, will be distributing our pinch-and-hold model later this year, and want someone who will lead the development of these models.

Our team moves fast and this role will be quite dynamic. You will lead but also be hands-on.

The ideal person will have worked with signal processing, and more specifically live time series classification from an embedded sensor stream.

For a demo of a bit of our tech, check out WowMouse[1], an app for smartwatches that lets you control devices like computers and tablets with your hand rather than a mouse (over Bluetooth). It shows only a subset of what we can do but already has tens of thousands of users.
