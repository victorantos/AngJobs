Zabit - Staff software engineer - Full-time - Remote (Hungary or California)

Zabit is a small startup building messaging applications that pair human workers with AI to enable affordable and accessible behavioral health outcomes, such as habit formation and cessation.

Looking to bring on a staff-level, full-stack-but-backend-leaning software engineer who loves Postgres, Kubernetes and node, but is able to pitch in on frontend (React &#x2F; React Native) too.

Please send your resume and github to hello@zabit.com
