Hatchet (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hatchet.run">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hatchet.run</a>) - New York City (IN-PERSON) - Full-time

We&#x27;re hiring a founding engineer to help us with development on our open-source, distributed task queue: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hatchet-dev&#x2F;hatchet">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hatchet-dev&#x2F;hatchet</a>.

We recently launched on HN, you can check out our launch here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136</a>. We&#x27;re two second-time YC founders in this for the long haul and we are just wrapping up the YC W24 batch.

As a founding engineer, you&#x27;ll be responsible for contributing across the entire codebase. We&#x27;ll compensate accordingly and with high equity. It&#x27;s currently just the two founders + a part-time contractor. We&#x27;re all technical and contribute code.

Stack: Typescript&#x2F;React, Go and PostgreSQL.

To apply, email alexander [at] hatchet [dot] run, and include the following:

1. Tell us about something impressive you&#x27;ve built.

2. Ask a question or write a comment about the state of the project. For example: a file that stood out to you in the codebase, a Github issue or discussion that piqued your interest, a general comment on distributed systems&#x2F;task queues, or why our code is bad and how you could improve it.
