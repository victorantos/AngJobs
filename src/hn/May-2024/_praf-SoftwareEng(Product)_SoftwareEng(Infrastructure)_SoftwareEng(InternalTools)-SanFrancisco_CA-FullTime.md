Column is the first nationally chartered bank built from the ground up for developers. We provide an API first, modern banking experience for our customers, replacing the bloated middleware and legacy software that currently powers most financial companies.

Started by the co-founder of Plaid, Column has a team of 8 experienced engineers and is currently processing hundreds of billions in payments annually, supporting some of the largest and most sophisticated fintech companies. We are currently hiring our first full-stack product engineer (React, Go) to build delightful banking UX. We are also hiring an experienced infra engineer (Go, Kubernetes, AWS) to help scale our systems. Finally, we have a new role open for a junior engineer to work on full-stack internal tooling (JS, Go) with lots of opportunities for growth. We all work on high impact, independently driven projects - writing code for regulated financial infrastructure at scale.
