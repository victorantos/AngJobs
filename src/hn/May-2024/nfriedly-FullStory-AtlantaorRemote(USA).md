FullStory | Atlanta or Remote (USA) | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;</a>

FullStory provides analytics and session replay for mobile apps and websites. We have a couple of engineering roles open:

* Software Engineer, Data Engine - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72ca46a7-6cfa-48ca-9e8e-579b6e6c914c&#x2F;?ashby_jid=72ca46a7-6cfa-48ca-9e8e-579b6e6c914c&amp;utm_source=092d6dbxgV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72ca46a7-6cfa-48ca-9e...</a>

* Senior Software Engineer, Enterprise Enablement - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;55f71333-decb-4c56-be5e-d5c02feb8c7b&#x2F;?ashby_jid=55f71333-decb-4c56-be5e-d5c02feb8c7b&amp;utm_source=092d6dbxgV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;55f71333-decb-4c56-be...</a>

* And a number of other roles including sales, marketing, product design, and legal. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a> for the full list and some general info.

The engineering roles might include working with Go (Golang), Typescript, React, GCP, Kubernettes, gRPC, Solr, and BigTable.

I&#x27;m not sure what the pay range for any of these roles is, but I can say that as a Staff Software Engineer on the mobile team, I make a bit over $200k base in addition to bonus and equity. All the usual benefits: healthcare, 401k matching, unlimited PTO (I take about 5 weeks a year), etc.

Feel free to reply here or email nathan@[company site] if you have any questions. (To apply, please submit your info on the website.)
