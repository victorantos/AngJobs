Val Town | Founding Engineers | ONSITE (Brooklyn) | Full-time | $150k &amp; 0.5-2% equity

We believe everybody should be able to code. Our product is as if Github Gists could run or AWS Lambda were fun. On Val Town, you can write, collaborate, and deploy code. Users make websites, HTTP endoints, crons, and email handlers. Our userbase is small but passionate, and growing quickly.

We just raised $5.5m from Accel, Tom Preston-Werner, Guillermo Rauch, and a bunch of other amazing angels. The dream is to hire 2-3 incredibly talented senior folks here in Brooklyn over the next 6 months. We have hard and interesting engineering, design and infra challenges to solve. We are a small team (currently 4) that take pride in our craft, think deeply, and ship often.
