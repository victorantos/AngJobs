Lokad is a bootstrapped profitable software company - 60 employees and growing fast - that specializes on predictive supply chain optimization. We are based in France, but the majority of our clients are outside France.

Supply chains remain wasteful and poorly resilient to tail risks (as demonstrated by present day situation). Weâ€™re talking about roughly 15% of the worldwide economy: supply chains are vast, and double-digit improvements remain possible. We want to put supply chains on AI autopilot, and deliver above-human performance while doing so.

Technologies used: C#, F#, Typescript, .NET Core, Linux
