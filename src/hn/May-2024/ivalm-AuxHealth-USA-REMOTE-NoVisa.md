We want every patient to have a doctor best friend: who tells them what their symptoms mean and where to go, who listens in on their critical appointments and explains the meaning of notes, and who gathers support from the community.

An end-to-end generative AI solution allows us to do that. As the first step, we have recently launched an LLM-powered symptom checker, MDandMe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdme.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdme.ai</a>). In about three months, more than 30 thousand people used MDandMe to get help with their medical problems. Their feedback has been outstanding and you can read more in our blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auxhealth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;intro-mdme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auxhealth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;intro-mdme</a>
