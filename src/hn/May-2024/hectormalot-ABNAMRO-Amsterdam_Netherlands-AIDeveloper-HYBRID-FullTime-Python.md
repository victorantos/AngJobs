ABN AMRO - Amsterdam, Netherlands - AI Developer - HYBRID - Full Time - Python

We&#x27;re looking for experienced people who want to help with our GenAI program. Roles range from project management to engineering to data heavy work, although there is less hard data science where LLMs are involved. We’re part of Strategy &amp; Innovation and we work on new products and new technology roll-outs across the bank. GenAI roll-out is one of our primary responsibilities.

We’re looking for people with a few years of work experience. This may also be in a different field, entrepreneurship or for example consulting. If you’d be comfortable taking 1-2  
juniors under your wing you’re in the right ballpark.

Please note that we&#x27;re not sponsoring visa&#x27;s for applicants outside of the EU.

Mention HN when reaching out. My email is in my profile.
