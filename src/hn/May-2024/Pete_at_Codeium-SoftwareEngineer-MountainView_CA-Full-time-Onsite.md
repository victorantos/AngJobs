We&#x27;re working on AI tools for developers (autocomplete, chat, and more unannounced things). We train our own LLMs from scratch and have over 1M downloads across our surfaces. We have many paying enterprise customers and have raised a total of $93M from Kleiner Perkins, Greenoaks, and Founders Fund. We&#x27;ve recently earned a spot of Forbes&#x27; AI 50 list, feel free check it out here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;lists&#x2F;ai50&#x2F;?sh=369a14ca290f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;lists&#x2F;ai50&#x2F;?sh=369a14ca290f</a>
