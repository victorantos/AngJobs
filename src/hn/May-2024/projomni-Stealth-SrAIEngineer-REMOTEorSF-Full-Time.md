Stealth | Sr AI Engineer | REMOTE or SF | Full-Time

Hey all - we&#x27;re a stealth startup founded by a serial entrepreneur with a successful exit &amp; raised a seed round from top Silicon Valley VCs. We&#x27;re on a mission to fix healthcare staffing shortages with AI.

We&#x27;re looking for an AI superbuilder who&#x27;s comfortable getting things done across the whole tech stack, with emphasis on backend. Practical experience with developing AI native apps leveraging ChatGPT, Claude or other LLMs is a must.

We&#x27;re open to bringing on a founding engineer, offering significant equity.

We use Python, NestJS, React, NextJS, Typescript, Kubernetes, Airflow and advanced machine learning systems.
