Houston Astros|Houston,Texas| Baseball Research Analyst|Full-Time|ONSITE

The Astros are looking for a new analyst to join our R&amp;D team. We deal with every aspect of the game, from supporting coaches developing minor league players to determining where a left fielder should stand given a certain batter&#x2F;pitcher matchup. We have mountains of data, and we have an organization that is willing to listen to the analysts and try things out. If you&#x27;re interested in feeding terabytes of data into powerful machines and leveraging your considerable cleverness, education, and domain knowledge to make a 3&quot; ball go faster- we want to hear from you.

We&#x27;re a generally Bayesian group, and so we&#x27;re looking for someone who has experience with some Bayesian tools. On the python side we use quite a bit of numpyro (and we love JAX) and there are some RStan models floating around too. Really we want someone who thinks it&#x27;s fun to stay at the cutting edge. We have a ton of data, we care about out of sample prediction, and I haven’t seen a p-value since I started working here (which is a good thing).

I found this job on a HackerNews Who’s Hiring post 8 seasons ago and I have really loved it ever since. There is freedom here to explore new ideas and technology. There is organizational buy in- If you can make a case for a course of action, you might see the team try it out on TV that night. I have 2 World Series rings with my name on them and my kids love coming to work (if I stuff them full of cotton candy). You don&#x27;t have any game time duties, but you do get free tickets.

Knowing about and loving baseball is not a requirement, but it would be a plus. Don&#x27;t let that keep you from reaching out. If you want to apply or just ask any questions, feel free to shoot me an email (rferguson at astros dotcom)
