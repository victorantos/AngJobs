Stanford University IT | Stanford, CA (next to Palo Alto) or Redwood City, CA | Full-time | Three positions | ONSITE (2 positions) or HYBRID&#x2F;REMOTE (1 position)

Stanford University IT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uit.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uit.stanford.edu</a>) provides a large number of IT-related services.  We provide contract desktop support for labs and departments.  We run the campus&#x27; academic&#x2F;administrative, residential, research, and related networks.  We provide Stanford&#x27;s analog and VoIP telephone service, along with related services (operator services, code calls, IR menus, call recording).  We provide Stanford Login (SAML&#x2F;OIDC), the Stanford Directory (LDAP), Active Directory, RADIUS, O365 &amp; Google &amp; Zoom integration, email routing (SMTP&#x2F;Proofpoint), Kerberos, cloud integration, and more.

Here are 3 positions to consider:

• DevOps Engineer: This is a HYBRID or REMOTE position.  If you choose to be HYBRID, you&#x27;ll be based in our Redwood City campus.  You&#x27;ll be part of the Authentication and Collaboration (ACS) group: From the list of services I mentioned at the top, the ACS group handles everything from &quot;Stanford Login&quot; to &quot;and more&quot;.  You&#x27;ll find a good amount of Perl (our preferred language from back in the day), but also a lot of Python and k8s (either on-prem k8s or GKE, with a bit of EKS).

• Data Center Engineer (2 positions): You&#x27;ll either be based at our primary research data center in Menlo Park (on the SLAC campus), or our enterprise data center (on the Stanford campus).  The Menlo Park position only focuses on our research data center, but has broader responsibilities: It includes everything from racking and cabling to maintaining and troubleshooting power distribution (415v Starline bus), UPS (spinning-mass), generators, VFDs, air handlers, chillers, PLCs, and the like. The Stanford position focuses just on facilities (not racking&#x2F;cabling), but has a more facilities to care for on campus.

If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site (except in Menlo Park). There is some on-call around the holidays. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation). All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards</a>.
