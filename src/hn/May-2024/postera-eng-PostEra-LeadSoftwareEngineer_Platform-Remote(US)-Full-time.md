My team at PostEra is looking for a Lead Software Engineer, Platform, to help us scale ML-powered drug discovery! We&#x27;re a team of scientists, ML researchers, and engineers who apply ML models and techniques to find new, more effective therapies for patients. We&#x27;re looking for a hands-on engineering lead to foster and grow our engineering culture, while also building and scaling our platform and microservices. We expect this role&#x27;s responsibilities to straddle ML, engineering, and infrastructure. We&#x27;re 100% remote and meet up ~3 times a year for face-to-face work.

Stack: Python, (a bit of) Rust, TypeScript (React), Terraform, AWS
