Zoo.dev is hiring a Senior Frontend Software Engineer with a core focus on 3D web application performance.

Zoo&#x27;s mission is to revolutionize the CAD industry by developing the world&#x27;s most advanced hardware design infrastructure and tools. Mechanical CAD is in the dark ages, and hardware demands have outpaced todayâ€™s hardware design infrastructure. The industry is due for a refresh, and we&#x27;re laying the foundation for a modern hardware design toolkit so that you can create new design tools never before possible. We were founded and incubated by Embedded Ventures in 2021, and we&#x27;re a fully remote team.

This person will play a crucial role in the development and enhancement of our novel open-source CAD modeling app, a next-gen hardware design application that allows users with advanced modeling capability. This is a &quot;back of the frontend&quot; role to ensure the performance and optimization of the app as we scale (tech stack: React, Typescript, Wasm, CodeMirror, XState).
