Pivot Health, a Healthcare.com Company | Remote, USA | Full-time | Software Engineering Manager - Insurtech Platform Team

Pivot Health is seeking an experienced Software Engineering Manager to lead our Insurtech Platform Team. At Pivot Health, we work with partners across the healthcare and insurance industries to craft products for people who don’t fit in a box. Through our network of agents and our direct-to-consumer website, we sell specialized individual health insurance plans and other products for people who are not a good fit for traditional employer-sponsored group plans or government-sponsored plans.

As the manager of the Insurtech Platform Team, you will lead a remote, multi-national team of software engineers to develop a new platform that will serve as the foundation of Pivot Health’s digital distribution in the future. Reporting to Pivot Health’s Vice President of Technology, you will work with engineering leadership at Pivot and Healthcare.com to shape the company’s technology strategy and create a culture of high quality, high performance, and high expectations. You will be accountable for the successful delivery of your team’s commitments and will work closely with stakeholders to keep them apprised of progress and risks.

You will be managing a team working on greenfield projects using a modern tech stack that includes React, Next.js, GraphQL, Hasura, Spring Boot, and Kubernetes. This is a new but already high-performing team in a fast-paced, results-oriented culture.

Apply using the link below. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at bmcnellis@healthcare.com. Candidates should be located and eligible to work in the US.
