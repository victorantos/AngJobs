I thought California required job listings to provide pay ranges.

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1162" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtm...</a>

&gt;3) An employer with 15 or more employees shall include the pay scale for a position in any job posting.

&gt;5) An employer with 15 or more employees that engages a third party to announce, post, publish, or otherwise make known a job posting shall provide the pay scale to the third party. The third party shall include the pay scale in the job posting.

Edit:  wow, so many California&#x2F;New York City&#x2F;Washington&#x2F;Colorado job listings that are omitting the legally required pay ranges

Edit 2:  Also see #29 and #34 below:
