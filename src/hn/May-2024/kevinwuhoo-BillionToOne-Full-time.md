BillionToOne - Menlo Park, CA; hybrid or remote (US only) - Full-time

BillionToOne (YC S17) is ranked at the top 5% of Y Combinator companies with $300M+ in funding from top VC firms. We have developed a DNA molecular counter that increases cfDNA diagnostic resolution by over 1,000x. Our first product, Unity, is the first and only non-invasive prenatal test that can directly screen an unborn baby and assess its risk for: common and severe recessive gene disorders; chromosomal abnormalities; fetal sex; and fetal antigens from a single tube of blood from the pregnant mother. This greatly improves the quality of care and is on its path to becoming the next standard-of-care.

Our software stack includes Python&#x2F;Django, React&#x2F;Typescript, Terraform, AWS, and many other standard tools. We&#x27;re a small, but nimble software team that prioritizes rapid iteration and continuous feedback to evolve our product. As a biotech company, we inherently need to always work cross functionally. If you enjoy this style of work, please reach out!

We&#x27;re hiring software engineers, a director of bioinformatics, and many other roles. You can email me directly at kwu@billiontoone.com with your resume or apply through the links below.
