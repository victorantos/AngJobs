Y Combinator | Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE | Full-time

You&#x27;re reading HN, why not come build software at Y Combinator itself! We are a small independent team of experienced engineers who try to make being funded by YC a great experience for founders. If the idea of designing software to help startups and the YC group partners sounds interesting to you, please reach out!

We work in Ruby on Rails, with a React&#x2F;Typescript frontend. We move quickly and autonomously, and while we&#x27;re not exactly doing rocket science (although we fund it), we&#x27;re always experimenting with ways to make the YC batch better.

YC has excellent compensation and benefits (see more in the formal job description below). The team and the work life balance are great. About half of us are former founders and many of us are parents. And if you’re curious about startups (and possibly starting one someday), this job gives you amazing access to interact with YC’s programs, partners, and founders.

Please drop me a line if you&#x27;re interested: casey@ycombinator.com
