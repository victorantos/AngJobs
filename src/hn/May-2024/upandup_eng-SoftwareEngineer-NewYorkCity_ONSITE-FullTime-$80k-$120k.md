Up&amp;Up | Software Engineer | New York City, ONSITE | Full Time | $80k - $120k

Up&amp;Up is a Series B real estate tech startup backed by Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures. Our program helps tenants build wealth while they rent with us, by allowing them to share in their homeâ€™s rental profits and price appreciation. You can read more about us at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upandup.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upandup.co</a>.

Software engineers at Up&amp;Up own problems from end to end - all the way from product ideation to technical implementation. We are looking for a new hire who wants to grow quickly and help us drive critical parts of the business forward with technology, acting as their own product manager, designer, and engineer.

We are targeting entry-level folks (0 - 2 year of professional experience), but welcome any applicants who are interested in working at a startup and having full ownership over business processes. Send your resume to engineering@upandup.co to get started!

Unfortunately, we are currently unable to accept applicants who need visa sponsorship.
