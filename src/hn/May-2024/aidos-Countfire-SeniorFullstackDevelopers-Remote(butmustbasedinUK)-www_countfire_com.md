Countfire | Senior Fullstack Developers | Remote (but must based in UK) | www.countfire.com

Countfire makes software for the construction industry. Our software is well loved because we try to design solutions that are a magnitude more efficient than existing tools.

We use all sorts of tech, but mostly MobX, React, Typescript, Python, Hasura, Postgres, Terraform, and AWS.

We have a great loyal customer base and lots of exciting ideas that need bringing to life.

Previously based in London, now seeking remote devs across the UK.
