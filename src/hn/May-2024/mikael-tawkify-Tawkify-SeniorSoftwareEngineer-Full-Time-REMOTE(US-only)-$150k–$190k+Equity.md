Tawkify | Senior Software Engineer | Full-Time | REMOTE (US-only) | $150k–$190k + Equity

About us: Tawkify is a personalized matchmaking service that blends technology and human expertise to foster genuine relationships beyond traditional dating apps.

Challenges: Recent advances in LLMs create opportunities for us to (i) supercharge the tools used by our matchmakers, and (ii) create innovative new products. We&#x27;re expanding our engineering team to take advantage of those opportunities.

Stack: AWS, mostly Typescript (front and back), MySQL and Elasticsearch. We also have a react-native app close to first release, and maintain some legacy PHP.

Role: We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Software Engineer who can not only code features and fix bugs, but also design architecture to lay the foundation for others&#x27; work.
