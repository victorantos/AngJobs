bellsong.net - Chief of Staff - First Employee - Remote - east coast hours - $60-$80k - 45 days vacation&#x2F;year

Bellsong is an early stage business exploring opportunities related to therapy. This is an opportunity to join early, work alongside an experienced founder (that’s me!) and grow with the organization.

We’re motivated by a few key questions:

* Is there an alternative to the high-growth startup model that centers customers and employees rather than outside stakeholders?

* Therapy changes lives. How do we honor and promote this practice?

* Therapists are superheroes. How can we support and uplift them?

We’re looking for a generalist. Your work will span three major areas:

* Operations: you’ll keep projects organized and on-track. In a chaotic startup, you’ll be a force for order.

* Writing: from emails and blog posts, to therapist profiles—you will use language to tell stories and convince others.

* Grit: this is a role where you’ll take out the proverbial trash. You will own all of the sometimes tedious administrative work.
