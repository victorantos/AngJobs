Touchpoint is transforming the restaurant industry for brands, staff, and guests.

Included natively in our platform are an in-store POS, mobile ordering app, gift card and payment processing, the most successful loyalty system in the industry, direct marketing, data analytics, and business intelligence.

Our backend primarily utilizes PHP, complemented by C and Python, and operates on FreeBSD, although some ETL servers are containerized on Linux. Our frontend clients, compatible across platforms, are developed in TypeScript with the Quasar&#x2F;Vue framework. We leverage cutting-edge technologies including ClickHouse, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, most of which is deployed&#x2F;orchestrated by SST&#x2F;CDK. Weâ€™re on the lookout for detail-oriented developers eager to join our team as we continue to grow through innovation and maturation of our platform, services, and products. Our streamlined company structure ensures every team member&#x27;s work directly influences our platform, underscoring the importance of each contribution.
