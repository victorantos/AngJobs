Autokroma.com - C &#x2F; C++, or Web (Deno, Full Stack) - Full time - Freelancing - Lisbon hybrid remote

We do audiovideo software (video editing, visual effects) and work remotely. We always need more engineers to expand our products and create new ones. I&#x27;m the CEO interviewing and I&#x27;m especially looking for self motivated individuals, who are good at remote text communication and able to organize and manage the work themselves.

Send me an email, the first part of the email is &quot;contact&quot; and after the @ it&#x27;s the domain name. Tell me your story, what you&#x27;re looking for in your life now, previous bad work experiences you&#x27;d like to void and good work experiences that inspire you for the future ! Thanks for reading me
