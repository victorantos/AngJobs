MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite

We&#x27;re building autonomous on-site construction robots at Monumental, starting with bricklaying.

I&#x27;m part of the software team, but this week I have been on-site in Amsterdam building the walls of a new canal. Does that sound exciting to you? You should apply!

We have built a product and technology that works, deployed it in real-life construction sites with excited pilot customers, and raised funding from some of the best in the world. We&#x27;re still a small and nimble team of ~20 and are hiring mechanical engineers and multiple software engineering roles (product, controls, and machine vision).

Our stack includes: Rust, TypeScript, Nix&#x2F;NixOS, Python.
