TileDB, Inc. | Full-Time | REMOTE | USA, Greece&#x2F;EU | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiledb.com&#x2F;</a>

TileDB has recently announced a $34 million Series B fund-raise and is actively hiring for engineers across a range of roles (SRE, backend&#x2F;distributed systems, database internals, and more). You will have the opportunity to work on innovative technology that creates impact for challenging problems in genomics, geospatial, machine learning, distributed systems, and many other areas.

TileDB Cloud is the modern database, allowing developers and scientists to capture, analyze, and share any data with any tool. We build on a broad foundation of open source, maintaining the TileDB storage engine, libraries for genomics (single-cell and population), geospatial (raster, point clouds, and more), a TileDB visualization engine extending Babylon.js, and much more ([github.com&#x2F;TileDB-Inc&#x2F;TileDB](<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TileDB-Inc&#x2F;TileDB">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TileDB-Inc&#x2F;TileDB</a>))

With TileDB, all data — tables, genomics, images, videos, location, time-series — is captured as multi-dimensional arrays. To supercharge this data, TileDB Cloud implements a serverless infrastructure delivering query execution, access control, data and code sharing, and distributed computing at global scale — eliminating cluster management, minimizing TCO, and promoting scientific collaboration and reproducibility.
