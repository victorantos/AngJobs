Scientific American - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;</a> - Full-Time - NYC or DC, &quot;flexible hybrid&quot;

*Scientific American*, yes, the legendary science magazine, is looking for its next Director of DevOps. We’re in the midst of a huge renovation job—we spent the last year replacing the entire failing legacy tech stack and building out the team. Next up: transforming the business into a modern digital media company with a big focus on audience growth and engagement. This person will also work closely with the data team on a variety of greenfield efforts that at least I think are pretty cool.

This is a hands-on leadership role. Brand new stack is AWS ECS GHA Fastly Postgres Redis and BigQuery. The main apps are a monorepo of Django and Node&#x2F;Express, and there’s some Lambdas on the side.
