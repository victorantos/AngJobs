We develop the RoboticScope a robotically, digital surgical microscope. We are searching for a software developer for the RoboticScope. You would be responsible for developing new features for the device including image processing on GPUs (Vulkan, Cuda, Wayland + KMS&#x2F;DRM), control of the robotic system, user interfaces (Qt + skia) and for everything that supports running the software on the device (Ubuntu, NixOS, deployment system). We work on Linux and use C++, Rust and Python.

If you are interested in high-performance, low-level native development, contact me: talents@bhs-technologies.com
