Notable Health is Hiring forward Deployed engineers.

We&#x27;re on a mission to simplify and optimize healthcare for humanity. Most of healthcare is digitized, but it hasn&#x27;t really changed. Humans still toil away at mundane, administrative tasks. Therefore, we&#x27;re turning manual work queues into fully automated workflows.
