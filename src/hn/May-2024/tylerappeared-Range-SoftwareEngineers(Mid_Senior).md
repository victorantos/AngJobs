Range is a Series A wealth management start-up looking to level-up the financial services industry.

It&#x27;s currently a small-but-mighty team of 10 engineers, ~40 people company-wide. Our tech stack is modern. You&#x27;ll learn TypeScript, GraphQL, React, AWS and have opportunities to bring in new-to-the-company technologies &#x2F; open source projects &#x2F; SaaS offerings.

There is SO much work to do. Every hour you put in contributes to the goal of building the future of wealth management. (You also get a free Range membership for life!)

Range HQ is in Tyson Corners, VA. We support fully remote for senior level positions.

If you have any questions, I&#x27;m be happy to set up 30 minutes to chat. (Current Range SWE, ex-Amazon, ex-Coupang, ex-Convoy).
