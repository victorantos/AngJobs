Stealth startup | ML Engineer (edge inferencing) | Bay Area or LA (hybrid) | Full-time

We&#x27;re a stealth startup building something unbelievably ambitious in the AI space that blends AI and gaming tech - co-founders are Andy Gavin [1] (co-founder of video game developer Naughty Dog) and myself (VP @ Microsoft, Credit Karma, previously Google and Naughty Dog). Venture-backed by top investors including First Round Capital and Battery. Get in on the ground floor and work directly alongside a living legend and a dream team of world-class talent.

We&#x27;re looking for someone who has deep experience with CoreML and optimizing model inferencing for mobile usage (e.g. ANE on iOS).

If interested, reach out to me at: scott@persona-ai.ai
