We&#x27;re on the lookout for a *Senior Front End Engineer* to join our growing tech team and be a part of our inspiring journey:

The front ends are being developed cross-platform in TypeScript using React Native for mobile in combination with React Native for Web and Next.JS for web. The backend consists of a mix of a few open-source components in different languages (currently mostly TypeScript &amp; Python). We use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as a cloud provider and Terraform for provisioning our services.

At holi, our team truly values a workplace where we can openly communicate and connect, using language that includes everyone. We appreciate the different perspectives that team members bring, and we create an atmosphere where new ideas are welcome. Learning is a continuous journey, and we&#x27;re all about sharing knowledge and making decisions together. We&#x27;re a close-knit team, helping and supporting each other while keeping things simple and practical rather than seeking perfection. We have zero tolerance for toxic or egoistic behavior, as we prioritize collaboration and positivity. Our main focus is on making a positive impact and prioritizing people over profits.
