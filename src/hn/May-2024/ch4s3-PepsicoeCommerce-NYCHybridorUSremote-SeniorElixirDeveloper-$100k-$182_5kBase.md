We’re taking on bigger and more ambitious projects this year and our team is looking for a highly motivated self-starter to help us achieve an ambitious set of goals. This is a cross functional role where you will work with business stakeholders, coach junior developers, take on difficult technical tasks, and collaborate with product and design.

We&#x27;re working with Elixir, Phoenix, LiveView, Postgres, Snowflake, Apache Druid, and some related technologies.

Feel free to reach out to me here or at chase[dot]gilliam[at]pepsico.com.
