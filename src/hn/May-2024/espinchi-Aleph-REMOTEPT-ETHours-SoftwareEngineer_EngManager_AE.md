Aleph | REMOTE PT - ET Hours | Software Engineer, Eng Manager, AE | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getaleph.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getaleph.com</a>

Aleph is redefining the world of Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A). We operate in a well-defined software category with a multi-billion TAM yet a lack of a clear winner. We’re here to change that, and our early results speak for themselves.

We’re backed by top VCs (Bain Capital Ventures, Khosla Ventures, YC, Picus Capital), and work with customers like Webflow, Turo, Notion, Zapier, and others.

What we’ve built so far is the most seamless way to centralize all of a company&#x27;s financial data – think expenses from Quickbooks or Netsuite, pipeline forecasts from Salesforce – and bring it into the tools finance teams are already using. But the vision goes way beyond that. We’re building the source of truth for a business’ data, and ultimately the platform businesses use to make better decisions.

We’re way ahead of schedule due to our unique approach, with pretty much no churn, and rapid growth despite no marketing spend to date.
