[planlab.ai](<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;planlab.ai" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;planlab.ai</a>) is a VC-backed startup building automated planning for infrastructure construction projects. Project overruns cost global economy over $580bn each year, because planning is broken: tech invented in 1950s cannot manage modern complexity. We are creating a tool that overhauls the way planning is done by creating structural models of how projects work, rather than capturing what humans think the plan should be.
