Lanai | Founding Engineers (Backend, Full-stack, Data&#x2F;Machine Learning)| Full-time | San Francisco Bay Area (2 days in-office) | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlanai.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlanai.com&#x2F;</a>
AI has the potential to change how we do our work forever - but with anything new comes unforeseen challenges. Our goal at Lanai (“Lean into AI”) is to ensure that every company is protected against AI risks as they take advantage of new technology to reach their full potential. Lanai surfaces usage of Generative AI by employees, identifies the best apps and models for each use case, and protects against sensitive data loss. As AI grows, so will we - we’re just getting started.

Lanai was founded in early 2023 by Steve Herrod (former CTO of VMware) and the talented team at Juxtapose. We’ve raised significant capital (more to share soon!) and are officially hiring for our engineering team. We’re an AI-first company, and are looking for team members who are excited to harness the best of AI to help us build a product and culture where our team and customers can work on the leading edge. We’re leveraging the most modern development tools and practices to ensure a productive and fun environment where everyone is inspired to do their best work. We are working with a modern, cloud-native stack with a focus on AWS, EKS, ReactJS, NestJS, GraphQL, Postgres, Hashicorp Vault, Python, Golang, and AWS Sagemaker.
