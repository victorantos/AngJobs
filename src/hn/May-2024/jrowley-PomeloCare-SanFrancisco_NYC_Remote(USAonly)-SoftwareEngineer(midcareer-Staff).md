Pomelo Care | San Francisco, NYC, Remote (USA only) | Software Engineer (mid career - Staff)

Pomelo Care is a multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, engineers and problem solvers who are passionate about improving care for moms and babies. As an early member of our engineering team, you will have the opportunity to shape the product, codebase, and culture at Pomelo for years to come.

On any given day, you may:

- Write clean, elegant code to build new features and keep our platform humming

- Design new systems to enable Pomelo&#x27;s clinical team to deliver personalized care to an expanding patient population

- Build a great mobile experience so pregnant women and new parents feel they have a support team in their pocket

Tools we use:

- GCP, Kotlin, Typescript, React, React Native, Terraform, Spanner DB, Big Query, DuckDB, Dagster, DBT, K8s

Personally, I&#x27;ve never had so much fun and learned so much at work. This team is the best so I recommend applying if you&#x27;re looking to learn a lot and make a big impact in an important space.
