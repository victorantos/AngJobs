Astranis (YC W16) - San Francisco, CA - Full-Time - Interns - On-site - US Citizen or Green Card

Astranis is on a mission to bridge the digital divide by connecting the four billion people worldwide who currently lack internet access. We&#x27;re doing this by building the next generation of smaller, more cost-effective spacecraft to bring the world online.

As a team, we’ve launched two satellites into orbit,  signed ten commercial deals worth over $1 billion in revenue, raised over $500 million from top global investors, and recruited a team of over 300 world-class engineers.

Our satellites, which operate from geostationary orbit (GEO), weigh only 400 kg and utilize a proprietary software-defined radio payload. Each satellite can connect over two million people, and we’re very excited for the impact we’ll soon have in the Philippines, Peru, Mexico, and more!

Backed by substantial funding and a passionate, collaborative team, we offer a rewarding work environment where you&#x27;ll learn and make a significant impact, no matter where you are in your career.
