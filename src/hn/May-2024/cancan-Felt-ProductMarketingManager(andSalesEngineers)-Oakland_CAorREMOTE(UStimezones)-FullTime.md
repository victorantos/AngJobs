Felt | Product Marketing Manager (and Sales Engineers) | Oakland, CA or REMOTE (US timezones) | Full Time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com</a>

Felt is the best way to make maps and work with geospatial data on the internet. It&#x27;s surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. We are taking on an industry that&#x27;s been stagnant for more than 30 years, but is essential to the workings of practically every company.

Felt is the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I&#x27;m an early Uber engineer.

We are looking for a product marketing manager who will put our platform in the front the eyes of the right people. The ideal PMM will have worked for a technical product and knows how to talk about it, have worked on launches (we do a lot! [2]]) and is comfortable in a start-up environment.

We are well-funded and organized. You can read more about it our funding here [3], and our announcement here [4]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[5]

If you are an experienced PMM or a Sales Engineer, please reach out via hello@felt.com and mention HN.
