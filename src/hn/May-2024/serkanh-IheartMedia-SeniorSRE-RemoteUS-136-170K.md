The Senior Site Reliability Engineer will be responsible for leading a talented team of SREs&#x2F;DevOps Engineers across a wide variety of Cloud Services. He&#x2F;She will be our leader as we move toward a platform &#x2F; systems architecture and infrastructure that is highly automated, fully instrumented, self-scaling, self-healing and loosely coupled. Must be a go-getter with efficient multi-tasking abilities along with efficient people management skills.

The infrastructure is entirely hosted on AWS, utilizing a variety of services. Core functionalities leverage AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and IoT Core for serverless computing, API management, and IoT device connectivity, respectively. The environment also incorporates multiple Kubernetes clusters, managed through both Amazon EKS and Kops. Infra is provisioned with CDK (typescript) so experience on it is highly desirable.
