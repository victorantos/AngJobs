Overleaf | Senior Full Stack Engineer | Full-time | REMOTE | UK, Germany, Spain, Romania

Overleaf (www.overleaf.com) builds modern collaborative authoring tools for scientists — like Google Docs for Science. We have over 16 million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language. It’s used by around 600,000 people each day and hosts over 100 million projects.

We’re looking for Senior Full-Stack JS Engineers who are comfortable with backend and a bit of frontend, frontend and a bit of backend, or a balance of both.

Some reasons you’d enjoy working with us:

- You’ll be working alongside a cross-functional team, including designers, product managers and developers, to help Overleaf become the go-to place for scientific writing.

- Much of our code is open source, so you’ll often be working on open source.

- Remote is a first class citizen; all staff work remotely. We get everyone together 2–3 times each year for valuable face-to-face time.

- Working hours can be flexible to your needs. Core hours are 1400-1700 UK time.
