Stainless | Generalist Engineers, First AE | NYC ONSITE | Full-time

(We were on hn recently: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40146505">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40146505</a>)

Stainless is building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs. Our first product is SDKs as a service. When you `npm install openai` or `pip install openai`, for example, you’re downloading code that we generated. (I built the codegen system at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)

Next, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right. We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection&#x2F;expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.

We’re ~2y old, ~10 people, have strong revenue (could choose to be profitable), and great customers (including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare). We’re backed by Sequoia.

As one of our first ten engineers, you’ll get autonomy to build great products, skilled peers, opportunity for tremendous impact, competitive salary, and a very competitive ownership stake.

We’re looking for exceptionally productive, thoughtful, tasteful, and kind people with a passion for making software development better for everyone.
