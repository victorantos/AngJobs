<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stileeducation.com&#x2F;au&#x2F;who-we-are&#x2F;engineering-at-stile&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stileeducation.com&#x2F;au&#x2F;who-we-are&#x2F;engineering-at-stil...</a>

We&#x27;re a small, high-performing, diverse, tight-knit team with a mission to radically improve mainstream science education at schools. By creating the best science lessons in the world, coupled with intuitive tools that allow teachers to take advantage of the latest pedagogies, weâ€™ve already helped millions of students in Australia get excited about science.

45% of Australian science students in years 7-10 (and an increasing number of US students) use Stile; come and help us grow our impact even further!

We&#x27;re looking for a bunch of new roles right now:

<pre><code>  - Head of Product Engineering
  - Product Engineering Team Lead
  - Head of IT
  - Full Stack Senior&#x2F;Staff Engineer</code></pre>
