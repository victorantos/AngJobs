Spruce - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spruce.eco" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spruce.eco</a> - Full Stack Developer - London&#x2F;Bristol based - Hybrid (UK only) - Full Time

We’re on the hunt for a phenomenal Full Stack Developer who’s pumped to help drive the transition away from fossil fuel heating in homes.

We need to replace every gas and oil boiler with a heat pump if we’re to reach Net Zero by 2050. But the current installation process is slow, manual, and inefficient; creating a shortage of installers, driving up costs, and frustrating homeowners.

We&#x27;re fixing this. We’re building an operating system for heat pump installers, helping to speed up their inefficient processes, boosting their profitability, and ultimately attracting new installers to the market.

We’re currently a team of 6, split between London and Bristol. We like to spend at least 1 day each week working together in-person.

We’ve made exceptionally quick progress over the past few months, but we’re only just scratching the surface of the opportunity ahead.
