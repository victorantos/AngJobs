We are a small Health Tech &#x2F; AI automation start-up growing 3x YoY (we just raised our Series A round!) and looking to expand our platform team.

Our core platform consists of a front-end app, back-end API, SDK, and some DevEx tooling. The tech stack consists of AWS, Typescript, NextJS, React, Python, and the Serverless Framework.
