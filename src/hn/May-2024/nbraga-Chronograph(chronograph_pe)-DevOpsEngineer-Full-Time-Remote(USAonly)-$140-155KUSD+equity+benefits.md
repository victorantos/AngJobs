Chronograph (chronograph.pe) | DevOps Engineer | Full-Time | Remote (USA only) | $140-155K USD + equity + benefits

Chronograph was founded to bring next-generation technology to private capital markets. Through our suite of cloud-based analytics and data management solutions, we help many of the world’s largest and most sophisticated venture capital, private equity, and credit funds understand their investment performance in unprecedented detail.

We are looking for a candidate with a generalist background in software development that has spent 3-5+ years specializing in DevOps&#x2F;SRE&#x2F;Platform Engineering. You’d be joining a small cross-functional team and have the chance to make critical contributions toward scaling our growing engineering team and business.

Our ideal candidate has a passion for automating ops, troubleshooting infrastructure, and creating first-class developer experiences. On top of that, fluency with the following (or similar) tools&#x2F;technologies might indicate a good fit: Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Docker.

Note that while this is a remote position, every employee is expected to join us onsite in NYC for “team week” which occurs 3x per year.
