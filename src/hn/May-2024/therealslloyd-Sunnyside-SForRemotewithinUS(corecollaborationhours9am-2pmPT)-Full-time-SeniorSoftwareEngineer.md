Sunnyside | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sunnyside.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sunnyside.co</a> | SF or Remote within US (core collaboration hours 9am-2pm PT) | Full-time | Senior Software Engineer

I am looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our team here at Sunnyside to help us craft an exceptional product experience for our growing community of mindful drinkers. Unlike virtually every other service in the alcohol health space, we focus on moderation and mindfulness rather than all-or-nothing sobriety. We help our customers improve their overall health and wellness without having to give up alcohol entirely.

Our ideal candidate is a backend-leaning full stack engineer who would be excited to own and deliver features end-to-end. TypeScript or JavaScript experience strongly preferred. NestJS on the server and React &#x2F; React Native for web and mobile clients. We are remote friendly, and those of us in the Bay Area work together in-person in SF a few days each week.

Apply here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view&#x2F;3774112895&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view&#x2F;3774112895&#x2F;</a> or email me directly steve [at] sunnyside [dot] co
