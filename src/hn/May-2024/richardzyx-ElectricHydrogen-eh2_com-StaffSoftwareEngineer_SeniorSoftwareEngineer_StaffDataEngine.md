Electric Hydrogen builds the world&#x27;s most powerful electrolyzer at 100MW using modular &amp; integrated design to radically lower the cost of green hydrogen production and increase global adoption. We just raised $380M in Series C financing, claiming the title of the first $1B green hydrogen start-up as recently covered by WSJ and TechCrunch.

The digital team works on everything from R&amp;D to manufacturing and field services. Our 100MW plant has thousands of sensors sampling at 1hz - 5khz or more, requiring robust data processing, visualization, analytics &amp; data science infrastructure. We deploy to some of the most remote regions on the planet with a product that needs to work reliably for decades, creating a unique challenge for networking, data ingestion &amp; software development. Moreover, our Gigafactory and R&amp;D labs are constantly collecting data for continuous improvements &amp; scientific discoveries, all requiring different features &amp; architecture to support and scale.

Benefits include competitive salary, ISO, 401K with match, and more.
