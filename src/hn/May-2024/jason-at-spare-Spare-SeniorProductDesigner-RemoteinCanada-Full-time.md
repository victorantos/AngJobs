Spare | Senior Product Designer | Remote in Canada | Full-time | <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparelabs.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparelabs.com</a>

Spare makes tools for transit agencies to run on-demand and accessible transit services.

We&#x27;re looking for a senior-level designer to help build the core tools transit agencies use - interfaces for scheduling rides, managing digital wallets, reporting on service data, and much more. You’ll also get to work on totally new AI products - so far, we’ve launched AI Voice to help riders book more easily over the phone, AI Scan to automate data entry, and AI-powered natural language search.
