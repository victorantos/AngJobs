Monad Labs - NYC Preferred &amp; Remote

Monad Labs raised $225M last month in series A funding to scale our team in bringing the Monad blockchain to production this year.

Founded by Jump Trading alums, Monad Labs is a 30-person tech startup using low-latency programming, compiler optimization, and multithreaded computing to build an ultra-high-performance smart contract platform. The work entails building an optimal stack-based VM that supports multithreaded computation, as well as developing and implementing an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm enabling a network of nodes to come to consensus.

We are hiring for the following roles, blockchain experience not required:
