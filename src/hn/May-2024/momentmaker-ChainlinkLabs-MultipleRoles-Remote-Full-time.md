Our Principles

At Chainlink Labs, we’re committed to the key operating principles of ownership, focus, and open dialogue. We practice complete ownership, where everyone goes the extra mile to own outcomes into success. We understand that unflinching focus is a superpower and is how we channel our activity into technological achievements for the benefit of our entire ecosystem. We embrace open dialogue and critical feedback to arrive at an accurate and truthful picture of reality that promotes both personal and organizational growth.

These roles are location agnostic anywhere in the world, but we ask that you overlap some working hours with Eastern Standard Time (EST).

We are a fully distributed team and have the tools and benefits to support you in your remote work environment.
