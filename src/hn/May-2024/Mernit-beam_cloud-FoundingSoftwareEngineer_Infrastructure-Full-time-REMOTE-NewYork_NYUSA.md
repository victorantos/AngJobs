beam.cloud - Founding Software Engineer, Infrastructure - Full-time - REMOTE - New York, NY USA

Beam is building a cloud runtime for running remote containers on GPUs. We’re used by thousands of developers for powering their generative AI apps, including companies like Coca-Cola, and we’re backed by great investors like YC and Tiger.

We’re building gnarly low-level distributed systems. You’ll have a major impact on the product and ship features directly to users. If working on a new Pythonic cloud runtime sound exciting, you might really like it here.
