Agentio - Senior Software Engineer - Full time - New York - NYC (5 days in office)

Agentio is the first ad platform for creator content, starting with YouTube. We make it as easy and efficient for brands to buy creator led ad reads as they can buy ads on Meta or Google. For creators, we enable monetization of up to 100% of their content with brands they love enabling them to 2x-5x their earnings. This enables smaller creators to work on their content full time and larger creators to expand their team and invest more in their content.

Join our early engineering team to help build the next great marketing channel and help creators live off and fund their work.
