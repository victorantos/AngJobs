Espresso AI is hiring founding engineers to automate performance engineering, starting with Snowflake data warehouses. Our team worked on ML and performance engineering in Google Search and Google Cloud, and we&#x27;re applying our expertise to build the world&#x27;s first neural optimizer.

We&#x27;re well-funded with paying users, but early enough for you to have significant ownership and impact. Reach out to me directly: ben@espresso.ai.
