Zep is building the long-term memory layer for the LLM application stack. With a fast growing open source community and recently launched cloud service, we&#x27;re seeking a developer relations engineer to accelerate adoption among developers and help shape our roadmap.

In this highly visible role, you&#x27;ll engage with the developer community across multiple channels - writing technical content, delivering presentations, creating sample apps&#x2F;demos, and fielding inquiries. Working directly with our founder + engineering team, you&#x27;ll help steer our product strategy.

Zep is funded by Y Combinator, Engineering Capital, and angels such as Guillermo Rauch (Vercel).
