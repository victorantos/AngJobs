Keeper (YC W19) | Full Stack Engineer | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepertax.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepertax.com&#x2F;</a> | Full-time | REMOTE

I&#x27;m Matt, CTO at Keeper. I&#x27;m hiring mission-driven product engineers who want to help freelancers with their taxes.

Taxes are a perennial, stressful problem. The IRS treats freelancers as businesses, meaning there is a lot of opportunity for business deductions, but also a lot of complexity that would normally be handled by an accountant. Our mission is to provide a human-in-the-loop AI system that provides the quality of an accountant at the cost of self-serve software.
