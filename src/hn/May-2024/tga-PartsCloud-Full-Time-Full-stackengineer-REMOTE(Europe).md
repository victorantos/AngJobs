PartsCloud | Full-Time | Full-stack engineer | REMOTE (Europe) | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;partscloud.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;partscloud.com</a>

PartsCloud connects industrial machine manufacturers with a global network of specialized logistics service providers and enables spare parts to be sent to customers worldwide within hours. This is a game changer for industrial SMEs that got stuck in the last century with their after-sales business.

We are looking for a full-stack engineer to focus on developing the customer and internal web apps (Django, server-side&#x2F;HTMX heavy, some JavaScript), and work together with the data team on the core platform. You should have experience with developing and running web applications in production.

Please apply with a brief cover letter mentioning you are coming from HN or feel free to message me directly with any questions.
