Privy - Onsite NYC (Preferred) or Remote (US&#x2F;Canada) - Hybrid Product&#x2F;Eng, Frontend, Fullstack, Backend Roles - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;privy.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;privy.io</a>

Hi, I&#x27;m Asta, CTO at the digital identity startup Privy. We build an authentication and cryptographic key management SDK that hundreds of companies integrate in order to onboard users (5M+ in the last 8 months alone) onto products built with blockchain infra and distributed systems.

We believe that when users own cryptographic keys, we shift the status quo so that users control more of their data and assets online. Privacy is fundamentally about ownership and revocation. User experience is our North Star, because users won&#x27;t compromise on UX.

We&#x27;re a small, high-ownership team building a product with real usage (&gt;2M MAUs, massive transaction volume) that developers love. We&#x27;ve raised $26M from Sequoia &amp; Paradigm. We ship constantly - multiple production releases per week.
