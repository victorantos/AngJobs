Livv Health - Remote - Europe timezone - Full stack engineer - Typescript, React Native, React

We&#x27;re building a global AI-driven health record. The premise is straightforward: the future of healthcare depends on continuous, data-informed care, with patient-owned health records at its core. It&#x27;s a significant shift, aiming to empower individuals over their health data.

The app works by letting you scan, upload, email health records to us and we analyse, and organise it and help you share it with your doctor. We help doctors work efficiently with the data.

We are a passionate team and we are looking for people who have a personal interest in patient owned health data. Startup experience a plus.
