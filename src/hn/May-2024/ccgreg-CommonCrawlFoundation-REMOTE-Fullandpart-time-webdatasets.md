Common Crawl Foundation - REMOTE - Full and part-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commoncrawl.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commoncrawl.org&#x2F;</a> - web datasets

I&#x27;m the CTO at the Common Crawl Foundation, which has a 17 year old, 8 petabyte crawl &amp; archive of the web. Our open dataset has been cited in nearly 10,000 research papers, and is the most-used dataset in the AWS Open Data program. Our organization is also very active in the open source community.

We are expanding our engineering team. We&#x27;re looking for someone who is:

* Excited about our non-profit, open data mission

* Proficient with Python, and hopefully also some Java

* Proficient at cloud systems such as Spark&#x2F;PySpark

* Willing to learn the rest: crawling parsing indexing etc.
