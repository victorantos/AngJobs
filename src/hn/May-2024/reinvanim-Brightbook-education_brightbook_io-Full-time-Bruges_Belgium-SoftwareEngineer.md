Brightbook | education.brightbook.io | Full-time | Bruges, Belgium | Software Engineer | onsite&#x2F;remote

* Who are we? *

Brightbook is a publishing platform for educational content, consisting of an in-house editor and interactive learning environment. It caters to schools as well as universities and learning and development professionals. It is built in the historic city of Bruges by a small and dedicated team that aims to provide both instructors and students with better tools and ways to experience their course material.For our engineering team we are looking to hire one or more software engineers, both junior and senior, to help develop the software side of our platform. We are growing at an ever increasing speed which provides us with numerous interesting challenges to tackle and opportunities to make a meaningful difference.

* What are we looking for? *

We are looking for talented developers who have at least some experience with React and its ecosystem (Typescript, Plate, Vite, …) but are not afraid to do some work in the backend as well (Ruby&#x2F;Rails in our case). As a rule, we put more value in mindset and attitude than experience with a specific stack. So if you have worked with other web technologies, such as Svelte or Vue, we’d still love to talk. It is important to note, however, that, since we are working in the Flemish educational market, we do expect you to speak Dutch or are in the process of learning Dutch.
Beyond that, we’d just love to have a chat to paint a broader picture and listen to what you can bring to the table!

* What do we offer? *

It goes without saying that you’d receive a competitive salary and all the social benefits you’d expect from a developer position. Beyond that, we offer a mix of remote work and working from our office in the city center of Bruges. We will also supply you with any development material you may need (Macbook, software, …). If you have any strong desires, we’d love to hear them as well. We really are invested in finding the right fit and making sure you enjoy working for our company for a long while!
