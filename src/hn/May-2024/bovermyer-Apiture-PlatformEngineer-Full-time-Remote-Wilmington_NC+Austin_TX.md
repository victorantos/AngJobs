Apiture | Platform Engineer | Full-time | Remote | Wilmington, NC + Austin, TX

Apiture is a fintech that runs consumer-facing banking for client banks and credit unions. Web banking, mobile banking, etc. We&#x27;ve existed since 2018, with a component added later that has existed since the late 90s.

I run one of the platform engineering teams. We&#x27;re working on the usual devops suspects, but also a new internal developer platform and developer experience. The platform engineering department has become the unofficial developer experience champion, and we have a reputation for innovation and leadership within Apiture.

We need someone who can handle supporting stable legacy systems alongside modernizing others. We write Go, Node.js, and Python code to automate things, and use Terraform and a bit of Cloudformation for infrastructure code. We&#x27;re an AWS shop, with a healthy mix of EC2 servers, SaaS components, and Docker&#x2F;K8s.
