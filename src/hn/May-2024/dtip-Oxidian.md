Oxidian - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxidian.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxidian.com</a> - Remote (UK&#x2F;EEA)

We build software for governments. We&#x27;re doing to government software services what challenger banks did to banking.

Our clients are mainly governmental research institutions - we&#x27;re building tools for scientists to process &amp; visualise data, HPC data processing libraries, plus web apps to make people&#x27;s working lives easier.

Currently hiring Python devs, Typescript&#x2F;React devs, and a freelance user researcher.
