Solar Monkey - Frontend Engineer - Remote or On-site - The Netherlands - The Hague - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.solarmonkey.nl&#x2F;o&#x2F;frontend-engineer-editors?utm_campaign=2024-04-Frontend&amp;utm_source=HackerNews&amp;utm_medium=blogpost" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.solarmonkey.nl&#x2F;o&#x2F;frontend-engineer-editors?utm_...</a>

At Solar Monkey (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarmonkey.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarmonkey.io&#x2F;</a>), our goal is to enable solar to be the world’s leading power supply, and we accomplish that with software that makes solar power systems more affordable, secure and reliable. We do so in a very open and warm environment, where everybody can have his or her say on company values, structure, and policies.

We are well funded and expanding, and currently looking for a full time front-end-focused developer to boost our team. While we&#x27;re versatile in full-stack, we&#x27;re on the lookout for someone who&#x27;s all about frontend finesse.

Our front end is written in React &amp; Redux, so hopefully, that excites you! However, our application isn’t too straightforward. It includes an advanced solar panel editor, built with HTML5 Canvas and overlayed on a Leaflet map that shows high-resolution aerial photographs. We even correct for view angle distortions in those photos!
