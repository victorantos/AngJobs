Scientific American | Senior Python Engineer | NYC or Washington, DC, flexible hybrid

Scientific American—yes, the storied science magazine—is in the midst of a massive renovation job. We recently launched our new article page—it&#x27;s slick and twice as fast—and have all sorts of interesting plans in the works for 2024.

There&#x27;s a lot to build, and I&#x27;m looking for another Senior Python Engineer to help make it happen.

Our brand new stack is Python&#x2F;Django + Express&#x2F;Vite&#x2F;React + AWS + Github Actions.
