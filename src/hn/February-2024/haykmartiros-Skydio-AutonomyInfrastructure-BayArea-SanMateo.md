Skydio - Autonomy Infrastructure | Bay Area - San Mateo | Python &amp; C++

Skydio is the leading US drone company and the world leader in aerial autonomy. Our mission is to make the world more productive, creative, and safe with autonomous flight. Today tens of thousands of our robots are flown at scale to inspect critical infrastructure and provide life-saving intelligence, and we have one of the best robotics teams on the planet in support of these goals.

Our X10 drone features NVIDIA Orin and Qualcomm 865 processors with 85 TOPS of compute capability, along with onboard 360 trinocular camera coverage. We develop real-time 3D reconstruction and semantic AI so that our robot can understand the world around it and make intelligent decisions.

Weâ€™re looking for infrastructure engineers and a director for our autonomy team who love making code for flying robots and for making our engineering team more productive. Experience with Python and C++, performance optimization, systems infrastructure, first-principles thinking, 3D visualization, communication and logging. full-stack web apps, and build systems all welcome. Very strong software engineering and computer science fundamentals required.

I lead the autonomy team and you can reach me at { hayk at skydio dot com }.
