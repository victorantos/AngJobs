Jamsocket - Senior Rust Engineer - NYC, on-site

Jamsocket is a platform for deploying WebSocket applications at scale. Think of it as AWS Lambda, but for WebSockets. We start ephemeral processes on demand, and keep them alive for as long as there is a connection to them.

This type of architecture was pioneered by Figma. We want to make accessible to every product dev team. Our core infrastructure is open-sourced as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plane.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plane.dev</a>.

Weâ€™re hiring a senior systems engineer. Responsibilities will include contributing to Plane, helping to build out our ambitious managed platform roadmap, and participating in on-call rotation.

We are a seed-stage startup backed by Y Combinator and other investors.
