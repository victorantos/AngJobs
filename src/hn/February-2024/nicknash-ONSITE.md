Asymptota.com (Sofia&#x2F;Dubai) - ONSITE

We are a next generation quant trading firm. We aim to be at the leading edge of automation and believe we have an excellent opportunity to challenge more established, larger, less automated incumbents.

We are well capitalised, very successful and looking for developers, traders and quants. It’s ok if you want to straddle those roles.

We’re especially seeking excellent engineers with good low-level knowledge and deep general software engineering experience.

This is a real chance to join a top tier HFT firm and have a huge impact.
We think the best work is done in person so relocation to Dubai or Sofia is required.
