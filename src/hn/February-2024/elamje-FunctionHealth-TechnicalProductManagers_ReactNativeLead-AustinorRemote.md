Function Health | Technical Product Managers, React Native Lead | Austin or Remote | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;functionhealth.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;functionhealth.com</a>

We are the fastest growing health membership in the US right now.

We&#x27;re on a wild ride of insane growth from basically $0 to tens of millions in revenue over the last year. Beyond revenue, we went from a few hundred subscribing members to tens of thousands. All of that and we&#x27;re still in Beta.

Our team is intense and strong. I&#x27;m hiring TPMs to join my team as the driving force of our engineering and product org. You&#x27;ll work across eng, design, marketing, and operations and be the glue that ties all of our pillars together.

Our roadmap has amazing applications of AI, wearables, health data, and more. I struggle to think of a product more interesting or impactful to work on.....and you&#x27;d be joining at the perfect time to scale it all up with us. It&#x27;s not easy, but you&#x27;ll understand how special the team is after you give us a shout.
