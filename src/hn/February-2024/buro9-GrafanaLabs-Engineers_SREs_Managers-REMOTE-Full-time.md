Grafana Labs - Engineers, SREs, Managers - REMOTE - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;careers&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;</a>

We make that dashboard thing you&#x27;ve all seen... we also make and operate massively scalable distributed databases for various telemetry, do lots of OSS things (+1K Github repos!), and having become the leader at observability in general we&#x27;re now focusing on things like application observability, correlating data &#x2F; exemplars, and creating new and easier ways to explore observability data... also, those huge massively distributed databases :)

We have been hiring constantly, and mostly struggle to keep our Greenhouse page up to date.

In my team alone (I&#x27;m VP, Engineering for the databases Mimir, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope) I need 2 EMs (1 in Europe, 1 in the USA&#x2F;Canada or Europe), an SRE in the USA&#x2F;Canada, an SRE in Europe, an Engineer for Mimir in the US&#x2F;Canada, and a couple of EU engineers for Loki. Those are just my team, but lots of teams are hiring. Additionally we will continually open roles throughout the year.

Grafana team really would like a Principal Engineer who knows distributed systems and databases built on object storage... we have lots of expertise here throughout the company, we just need more people who can ramp up fast :D

The greenhouse page works, but if you don&#x27;t see something I&#x27;ve mentioned feel free to email (in profile).
