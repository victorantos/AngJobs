OrbStack - Founding Engineer - US&#x2F;Europe REMOTE - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orbstack.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orbstack.dev</a>

OrbStack is making Docker containers &amp; development environments delightful. Our app replaces Docker Desktop and makes containers faster, lighter, and easier to work with. It&#x27;s the tool of choice for PlanetScale, Replicate, and other hot companies.

Containers should be a joy to use, not something you have to put up with. Let&#x27;s build the future of dev envs.

As a founding engineer, you&#x27;ll mainly work on breaking high-level ideas down into tough systems problems, solving them, and taking ownership of projects.
