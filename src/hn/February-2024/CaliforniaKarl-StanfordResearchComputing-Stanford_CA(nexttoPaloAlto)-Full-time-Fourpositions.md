Stanford Research Computing - Stanford, CA (next to Palo Alto) - Full-time - Four positions - HYBRID&#x2F;ONSITE

Stanford Research Computing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu</a>) is a collaboration between University IT and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. We operate HPC environments for researchers, we do one-time consultations on projects (from software and pipelines, to data management, to physical building design and fit-out), and we provide contract support for individual Labs, Departments, and Schools.

We have four open positions:

• GPU Cluster System Admin: We&#x27;re looking to get an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD for researchers to use. Besides running the system, you&#x27;ll help users scope their jobs to maximize utilization. You should already know CUDA; integration with HPC; and ideally one or more of AI&#x2F;ML software and frameworks, deep learning, and LLM training.

• Cloud Engineer: Most of our researchers use Google Cloud, but it can be difficult to manage, from admin and cost standpoints.  Your job would be to help researchers deal with it all! You should already know Linux sysadmin stuff, as well as methods for doing compute in the cloud (from Compute Engine to k8s). GCP-wise, knowing BigQuery would be helpful.

• Data Center Engineer: You&#x27;ll be based full-time at our primary research data center in Menlo Park (on the SLAC campus). This position includes everything from racking and cabling to maintaining and troubleshooting power distribution (415v Starline bus), UPS (spinning-mass), generators, VFDs, air handlers, chillers, PLCs, and the like.

• Data Center Director: Our current Data Center Manager is getting ready to retire!  We want to have a replacement hired in advance of that, to ensure a smooth transition.  You&#x27;ll manage two Data Center Engineers, work with Stanford Facilities folks, and possibly oversee construction of a future research data center.

The data center positions are onsite; the others are hybrid. If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site (except at the data center). There is some on-call around the holidays. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation).  All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards</a>.
