Sanctuary Computer | Senior Fullstack Developer | Hybrid (Remote and&#x2F;or NYC) | Full-time

At Sanctuary Computer(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanctuary.computer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanctuary.computer&#x2F;</a>) — we’re building a different type of technology shop. Based in NYC’s Chinatown (and remote), the way we approach building things is more like a restaurant than a traditional agency, with an emphasis in providing our clients with an outspoken sense of comfort and hospitality.

- Helping us to scope and estimate development work on client projects

- Drafting technical architecture plans for implementation

- Communicating directly with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline

- Owning the success of the project with a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline

- Supporting more junior team members through code review and advising

- Contributing to projects as an individual contributor and lead
