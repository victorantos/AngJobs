gordianrobotics.com | Pittsburgh, PA | ONSITE | Senior Perception and Computer Vision Engineer | Full-time $120k-220k + equity

Gordian:

We&#x27;re a team of former autonomous vehicle engineers reinventing real-time inventory management for retailers. It&#x27;s 2024 and retailers still struggle with keeping track of inventory on shelves and conducting restocking, which severely hurts their bottom line. Our approach is the first of its kind - we&#x27;re solving this problem without physical robots or fixed cameras.

We&#x27;re looking to hire senior perception and computer vision engineers to join our growing team as we finish refining our product.

Reach out to me at michael@gordianrobotics.com introducing yourself, and please include a resume!
