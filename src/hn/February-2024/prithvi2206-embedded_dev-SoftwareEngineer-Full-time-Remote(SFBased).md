embedded.dev | Software Engineer | Full-time | Remote (SF Based) | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;embedded.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;embedded.dev</a>

Vertical SaaS is a trillion dollar market, and SaaS businesses see their revenue increase on average 40% (sometimes &gt;200%) when adding financial services products. Unfortunately, because of the high complexity of launching financial products, only the largest companies can put in the investment needed to reap those rewards. We&#x27;re offering pre-built, white-labeled financial applications that enable SaaS platforms to integrate financial services products easily, without having to invest material development or operations resources.

As we look toward launching with our first customers in the second half of 2024, weâ€™re building out a founding team to work with us as we reach each milestone along the way.

We&#x27;re hiring founding Software Engineers (entry-level to senior+) to join our team. To apply, send an email to jobs@embedded.dev introducing yourself, and learn more at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;embedded.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;embedded.dev</a>
