Thrive is a leading behavior change technology company founded by Arianna Huffington in 2016 with the mission to redefine productivity through well-being.

We help individuals and organizations improve well-being, performance and mental resilience with small, science-backed steps and AI-powered behavior change. Thrive has been adopted by employees at more than 125 organizations in over 140 countries, from frontline and call center workers to executives at multinational companies.

At Thrive, we know that employee well-being isn’t a benefit, it’s a strategy for success. That’s why everything we do is built on the belief that we do better work when we take better care of ourselves.
