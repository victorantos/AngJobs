HEAVY.AI - SQL Analyst&#x2F;Wrangler - Part-time or Full-time - Remote

HEAVY.AI builds a GPU-accelerated analytics platform that allows users to interactively query and visualize billions of records of data in milliseconds.

We’re looking for someone who really knows SQL. If you can decipher schemas, figure out what’s wrong with SQL statements and correct them, as well as generate queries in response to user questions, we&#x27;d love to talk to you.

The work would initially be on contract, but could lead to full-time employment. Geospatial analytics, data science background, and Python programming skills would be very useful to have as well, but are not absolute requirements.

If interested please reach out to pey.silvester@heavy[dot]ai.
