Mightier is a video game platform that uses biofeedback to help kids&#x27; mental health. Our intervention is clinically validated, with efficacy on par or greater than current treatments (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mightier.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mightier.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;</a>). Currently we are integrating with the healthcare system to provide access via normal healthcare channels (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketplace.org&#x2F;shows&#x2F;marketplace-tech&#x2F;in-one-state-a-video-gaming-app-for-kids-well-being-is-now-covered-by-medicaid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketplace.org&#x2F;shows&#x2F;marketplace-tech&#x2F;in-one-st...</a>).

It only works if kids use it! We are hiring a software engineer to help our game team. Our software is built in C# using the Unity game engine. We pay close attention to our kids to stay close to who we are making this for. We pay close attention to our parents and clinicians to keep it grounded in the real world. Our ideal candidate has shipped at least one title.
