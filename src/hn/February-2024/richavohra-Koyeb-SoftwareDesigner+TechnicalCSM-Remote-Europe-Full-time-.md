Koyeb | Software Designer + Technical CSM  | Remote - Europe | Full-time |

At Koyeb, we make developersâ€™ lives easier with the fastest way to deploy applications globally. The Koyeb Serverless Platform is completely managed: we take code, build it into containers, and run it inside of MicroVMs distributed across multiple continents.

Software Designer:  We are looking for our first Software Designer to help us shape the features we build for our users. This starts from the big picture of how the features operate together as a system, to fine-tuned UI details, all with the goal to create a friction-free developer experience.

Technical Customer Success Manager:  We are looking for our first customer success manager to help our professional customers deploy on the platform and adopt advanced features. This job is focused on helping our users, who are developers, adopt the product and quickly deploy their production applications on the Koyeb platform.
