SpotHero | ONSITE (Hybrid-schedule) in Chicago or Toronto | Full Time

SpotHero is the leading marketplace for parking reservations. We help drivers easily reserve parking for commuting, events, or any reason they are out and about.

We have multiple open roles! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spothero.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spothero.com&#x2F;careers</a>

We&#x27;re hiring for:

- Multiple backend engineers roles in Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Postgres and&#x2F;or JVM language&#x2F;Postgres

- Senior Business Analyst - SQL and modeling expertise

- Senior Data Engineer - data modeling &#x2F; pipelines &#x2F; infrastructure

- Senior &#x2F; Staff Data Scientist - experienced production-focused data scientist

We prefer to hire in our hub cities for locality but our approach to onsite is flexibility first and most of our time is WFH. Feel free to apply online or reach out to me at tom dot janofsky at Spothero dot com.
