With Atlas, founders can start a company in a few clicks, from anywhere in the world. We believe that startups are one of the most effective ways to solve the world’s problems, and we want to give founders a running start. Atlas helps founders incorporate and set up their company, get discounts for the internet’s best tools, and automate operations while feeling ambitious, smart, and assured. Our goal is to create more startups that get to product-market fit, fast.

Atlas is a small but mighty team within Stripe that moves fast to make things better for founders. In the past year, we’ve automated 83(b) election filing, helped founders purchase their shares in a single click - no cash needed, and enabled founders to open a bank account and use Stripe payments even faster. We currently help around 15% of US startups incorporate their companies.
