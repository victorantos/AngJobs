Are you actually hiring? I applied for one of these exact roles not long ago and interviewed, but received a generic rejection about how you found another, better, candidate. I use your product and really like it, seemed like we had a good vibe and my skillset exactly aligned with the JD.

I&#x27;ve asked others who&#x27;ve applied for these roles and the story seems the same. I&#x27;d hate to have my time, your time, or another candidate&#x27;s time wasted.
