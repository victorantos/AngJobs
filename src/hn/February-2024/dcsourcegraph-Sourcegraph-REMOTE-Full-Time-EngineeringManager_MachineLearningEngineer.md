Sourcegraph | REMOTE | Full-Time | Engineering Manager, Machine Learning Engineer, Software Engineer, Developer Advocate, Enterprise Product Manager, Technical Advisor | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcegraph.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcegraph.com</a>

Sourcegraph is a code AI platform that makes it easy to read, write, and fix codeâ€“even in big, complex codebases.

We are building Cody, an AI coding assistant that uses code search and code intelligence to help devs quickly understand what&#x27;s happening in code and generate new code that matches the best practices in your codebase. Cody supports AI-enabled autocompletion, fixing bugs, refactoring, test generation, code explanation, and answering high-level questions. You can read Steve Yegge&#x27;s (our Head of Eng - Cody) post on why Cody&#x27;s code context engine differentiates it from the fast-moving field of AI dev tools: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cheating-is-all-you-need" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cheating-is-all-you-need</a>.
