With a focus on Data Science, I am actively seeking remote work opportunities. My educational background includes Master&#x27;s studies in Statistics and Operation Research, providing a strong foundation in Pure Mathematics, Data Structures, Algorithms, Probability and Statistics, Operation Research, Optimization, Cryptography, and Image Processing.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have undertaken advanced courses in Python, R, C++, VBA, and SQL database. These technical skills have been applied in real-world scenarios for Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and effective Database Administration. I have successfully implemented these competencies in various projects, showcasing their practical utility and contributing to meaningful outcomes.

Beyond technical expertise, my proficiency in IT tools such as Excel and Power BI enhances my ability to address data-driven challenges effectively. I am eager to bring my analytical skills and practical experience to a dynamic role that leverages data for informed decision-making. If you have any opportunities aligning with my skill set, please feel free to reach out.
