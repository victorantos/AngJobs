Corbalt | Software Engineer | Remote | Full Time or Contract

Corbalt is a small group of technologists working to build better software infrastructure for government. We were part of the tech team that came in to help fix healthcare.gov and were inspired by how much everyone cared and worked hard to fix the site (from tech team members, to government contractors, and government employees), and how much progress we all made in a short time.

As weâ€™ve continued to work with the government we focus on opportunities where we can build simple, scalable solutions to help support important government missions like helping people get health insurance (healthcare.gov) and helping ensure healthcare for vulnerable populations (Medicaid). We use innovative technology to create software infrastructure that&#x27;s easy to use and develop applications that focus on addressing users&#x27; core needs.

We&#x27;re a small team with experience at Google, Palantir, Bell Labs, Microsoft, and Silicon Valley startups. We work remotely by default and are spread across states. We look to hire technologists who are passionate about improving public services, love working as a part of a team, enjoy consulting with clients to develop creative solutions to complex problems, and are committed to fostering a kind work environment.
