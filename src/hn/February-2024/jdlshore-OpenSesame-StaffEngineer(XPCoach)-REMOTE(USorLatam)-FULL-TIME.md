OpenSesame - Staff Engineer (XP Coach) - REMOTE (US or Latam) - FULL-TIME - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensesame.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensesame.com</a>

We&#x27;re an eLearning marketplace and late-stage startup. We have about 65 engineers that are going all in on Extreme Programming (XP) and Fluid Scaling Technology (FaST). We need multiple Staff Engineers with experience in XP practices—such as test-driven development, continuous deployment, and evolutionary design—who will help improve the skills of engineers across the organization.

You&#x27;ll act as a hands-on player-coach who leads by example to teach and mentor the engineers you work with. You&#x27;ll come up to speed quickly in an unfamiliar codebase, identify challenges, and coach team members in addressing them. You&#x27;ll work as a leader in a team of Staff and Principal engineers to spread XP skills throughout the organization, as well as working with me (VP Eng) to define skill development strategy.

We primarily work in TypeScript &#x2F; Node &#x2F; React, but we also have a large PHP &#x2F; Drupal legacy codebase that you&#x27;ll be helping us retire.

If you apply for this job and have extensive XP experience, send me an email (address in profile) explaining your background so I can give your interview priority.
