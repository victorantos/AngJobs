Engineering Manager | Multi-Blockchain Protocol | 100% Remote (UK &amp; EU)

I am working with a market leading financial trading firm who are building a brand new multi-blockchain protocol and are looking for an Engineering Manager to help do so.

There is a small team of around 10 Engineers, and a small Open Source community behind this project.

They are really looking for someone who knows how to build and engage with communities of Developers, and understands Open Source.

Blockchain and Web3 experience is highly desirable but not essential.

Please reach out to me to have a brief chat and find out some more info:
