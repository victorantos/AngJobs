Loft Orbital Solutions - Various Positions - San Francisco, CA; Golden, CO; Toulouse, FR - ONSITE

Loft Orbital builds &quot;shareable&quot; satellites, providing a fast &amp; simple path to orbit for organizations that require access to space. Powered by our hardware &amp; software products, we operate satellites, fly customer payloads onboard, and handle entire missions from end to end - significantly reducing the lead-time and risk of a traditional space mission.

Our standard interface enables us to fly multiple customer payloads on the same satellite, with capabilities such as earth imagery, weather &amp; climate &#x2F;science data collection, IoT connectivity, in-orbit demonstrations, and national security missions. Our customers trust us to manage their space infrastructure, so they can focus on what matters most to them: operating their mission and collecting their data.

At Loft, you&#x27;ll be given the autonomy and ownership to solve significant challenges, but with a close-knit and supportive team at your back. We believe that diversity and community are the foundation of an open culture. We are committed to hiring the best people regardless of background and make their time at Loft the most fulfilling period of their career.

We&#x27;ve launched three satellites so far, with more on the way! Our next satellite, YAM-6, is pioneering virtual missions, allowing customers to load applications on the satellite and utilize the sensors on board to test and validate their algorithms.
