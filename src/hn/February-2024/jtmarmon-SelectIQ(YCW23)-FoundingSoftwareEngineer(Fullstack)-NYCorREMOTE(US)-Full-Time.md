SelectIQ (YC W23) | Founding Software Engineer (Fullstack) | NYC or REMOTE (US) | Full-Time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selectiq.ai&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selectiq.ai&#x2F;</a>

SelectIQ works with clinical trial sites and their referring physicians to automate the patient referral process, massively speeding up enrollment.

Bringing new drugs to market is primarily rate limited on the speed of clinical trials, which are themselves bottlenecked by patient recruitment. 80% of clinical trials donâ€™t meet their recruitment timeline, and being behind on recruitment can cost pharma companies millions of dollars per day.

We&#x27;re looking to bring on our first engineering hire to help us build out the platform and build an amazing culture.
