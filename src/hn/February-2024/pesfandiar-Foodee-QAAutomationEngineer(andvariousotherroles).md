Foodee - QA Automation Engineer (and various other roles)- Full Time, REMOTE (BC&#x2F;ON in Canada only)

We connect high-quality, locally owned and operated restaurants to offices via catering and meal plans. Office managers love how we simplify the process, independent restaurants love how we bring them new business during their off hours, and employees love ordering food a few days a week and receiving it labelled and ready to eat!

Our dev group is growing fast and we&#x27;re hiring for multiple roles. We&#x27;re specifically interested in a Senior QA Automation Engineer [1] with experience at medium to large tech companies. If you care about the quality of software products that contribute to communities positively, we&#x27;d love to hear from you!
