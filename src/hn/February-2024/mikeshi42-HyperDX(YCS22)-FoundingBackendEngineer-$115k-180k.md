HyperDX (YC S22) | Founding Backend Engineer | Hybrid SF&#x2F;San Mateo | $115k - 180k

We&#x27;re building an open source, dev friendly observability tool (think Datadog, but something developers actually love to use and companies can actually afford).

We&#x27;re in the intersection of needing to build rock solid infrastructure ingesting TBs of data, searching it incredibly quickly and scalably, and layering on top a buttery smooth DX from our language-specific SDKs, APIs and web app.

We&#x27;re super early and hiring our first founding engineer. We already have a cloud product customers pay for and love, loads of runway regardless of the wider economy, 5k+ Github stars, and tons of hard technical problems.

The vast majority of our work is open source, so you can get a sense of what you&#x27;d be working with here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hyperdxio&#x2F;hyperdx">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hyperdxio&#x2F;hyperdx</a>

I&#x27;m Mike, one of the cofounders. If you love shipping quickly and want to help us build from the ground up an open source developer tool (that devs won&#x27;t hate when they&#x27;re on-call), let me know! mike [at] hyperdx.io
