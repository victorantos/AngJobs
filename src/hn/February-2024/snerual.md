Schoolyear (Remote CESTÂ±1) - we&#x27;re a fast-growing start-up based in The Netherlands. Our aim is to simplify IT for educators, allowing them to focus on what truly matters: teaching.

We&#x27;re looking for a backend engineer that loves to work in a small, fast-pace. We&#x27;re looking for a new team mate that likes the challenge of building rock solid infrastructure, and also likes to build products that people like to use. At this role you can combine the two.
In our team we believe &quot;boring&quot; infrastructure is better infrastructure.

We&#x27;re a tight team (11, 6 engineers) working from all over Europe, all with our own core skills. We work in 8 week development cycles (6 sprint, 2 cooldown) and we have strong technical leadership. We meet up 4 times a year in a team mate&#x27;s city for an on-site week.
