Continua was founded in April 2023 by a Distinguished Engineer from Google Research to reinvent how people interact with information, with services, and with each other.

We&#x27;re very early; after building several prototypes in our first few months, we’ve developed conviction about an MVP, and we’re building like mad to bring our ideas to users. This is an opportunity to join and help set the product and technical direction of this brand-new company! ML engineers at Continua work on new approaches for knowledge representation, multimodality, and personalization under computational resource constraints. Systems engineers at Continua work on a wide variety of secure and reliable backend services and data pipelines to power our products.

We’re backed by tier-1 VCs, and we’ve already assembled a team of six engineers with backgrounds at Google, Microsoft, Slack, SpaceX, CourseHero, and Stash. We have a limited number of additional spots available on the team for engineers who are excited about building innovative products that leverage the latest advances in ML.

If you are passionate about building innovative new products, and you’re eager to work in a dynamic startup environment, we would love to hear from you.
