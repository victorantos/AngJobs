What sucked the last time you rented a house or flat? Come and fix it.

OpenRent is a force for good in an industry tarnished by rip-off agencies. Enabled by an unrelenting focus on technology, we now let more properties than any agency in the UK. In the last 12m we let over £50 billion worth of property, to over 6 million registered users, without ever charging any admin fees.

You&#x27;ll be working on solving every aspect of the rental journey, from machine learning models to predict the right price of a property, to building the future of property management, all to help tenants find their dream home, and landlords their ideal tenant.

We&#x27;re VC backed, profitable, and have plenty of ambition to maintain our fast growth in this absolutely massive market.
