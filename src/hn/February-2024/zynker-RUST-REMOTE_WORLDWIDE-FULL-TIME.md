RUST | REMOTE, WORLDWIDE | FULL-TIME

Zynk is building a totally new, all-platform file transfer application that is going to do things right - and will be a breath of fresh air in this crazy world of colossal cloud-powered inefficiency (HN Launch pending).

We&#x27;re a Rust only shop, hiring a REMOTE Rust developer.

If you&#x27;re fascinated by efficiency, performance, stability, reliability, doing things right, as well as pushing the boundaries of what modern hardware and networking can do, this may be for you.

If you&#x27;re not afraid of creating a custom solution that answers the very narrow needs of a task, and and doing it the best way possible, this may be for you.

If you ever thought or pondered about if this insane, bloated cluster of cr*p can be replaced by a single modern machine running some custom code or carefully picked components, this may be for you.

If KISS means something to you and you love the CLI, this may be for you.

If you appreciate what Rust can do for you and the entire lifecycle from dev to robust product, this may be for you.

If you&#x27;ve reached the end of this post, this may be for you.

We&#x27;re easy, flexible, non bureaucratic and we don&#x27;t waste time on unnecessary things.

Ignore the website, we&#x27;re in stealth mode. Apply at: m at zynk.it
