Tether Data - Front End Engineer - Remote - Full-time

Tether Data (tetherdata.io) is a no-code data movement &#x2F; ETL platform built for operations leaders in Go-To-Market orgs (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, etc).

We are looking for our first frontend hire that can own our web client. Our entire platform is built on a micro-services architecture (with the backend being mainly Rust), but we are looking for someone with the following experience:

- ~10+ years of experience building frontend web apps (ideally can share examples)

- Comfortable working with a fully distributed team (we&#x27;re all over North &amp; South America)

- Experience with any sort of ETL&#x2F;Data products or GTM applications is preferred, but not required
