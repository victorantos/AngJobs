ReciPal (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recipal.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recipal.com</a>) | Founding Rails&#x2F;Full Stack Software Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time

We are hiring a full-time engineer who can hopefully be a technical stakeholder and business partner.

ReciPal is a profitable, growing, bootstrapped, and (have always been a) fully remote company (based in New York) with just about 4 full-time employees. We make simple software for food businesses - nutrition analysis and labeling, costing, and inventory management.

You&#x27;d be working directly with me, solo founder, and our senior engineer and hopefully take on a growing role over time to potentially lead engineering and become a business partner. It&#x27;s a very low key work environment, but independent and plenty of responsibility and ownership for the right person.

Stack includes Rails 7, JavaScript, Postgres, Heroku.
