DevOps Engineer - Robotics
Atlanta, GA  Full-Time
Greenzie is hiring a DevOps Engineer on our Robotics team to further our mission to free humans from repetitive outdoor labor. We’re accepting applications on an on-going basis, with flexible start dates, but ideally we’d have someone tomorrow if we could.

JOB DESCRIPTION
As a Robotics DevOps Engineer you will ensure building, testing, and deploying is a smooth and stable process, so that robotics engineers can focus on robotics development. You will:

* Collaborate with robotics engineers and customers to manage code releases and deployments
* Manage, analyze, and toss out (and save a little bit) of the massive amount of data we collect
* Develop software, build pipelines, scripts, and documentation to improve the way we build, deploy, and test
* Code-review, pair-program, and problem solve with teammates

This position will also involve daily stand-up meetings, weekly team meetings, high level architecture meetings, retrospectives, and long term strategic road-map planning. And the best thing is, we’re a startup and we need your help in continuing to build a great company: if you want to be involved in other areas of the company, it&#x27;s up to you. From customer discovery to sales and marketing, the field is wide open for you to participate and help us fulfill our mission.

Important: this position is focused on helping the robotics team test and deploy code to our fleet of robotic mowers, not assisting the web platform team on a traditional web application stack.

ABOUT YOU
As a candidate you already:

* Have DevOps experience deploying things into production
Have experience with Linux (Ubuntu LTS preferred), Docker, CircleCI, and more
* Are familiar with debian package management and best practices
* Have programmed in Python or similar Object Oriented languages
* Know Git, Bash and your way around a terminal
* Desire to free humans from hard, manual labor

As a bonus, you may already have experience:

* Working in the robotics industry or knowledge of ROS
* Working with ARM-based systems and cross-compilation
* Have working knowledge of VPNs, certificates, and other security tools
* Building test infrastructure or automated test frameworks
* Familiarity with AWS tools

You may have a Computer Science or direct engineering degree. You may not. That’s not necessarily top of mind for us: we value what you can do, not just how you learned to do it. Solid code and strong experience is just as valuable to us.

We have big goals, but try to zoom out on high-level initiatives when appropriate to get day to day work,  week to week planning, and big quarterly projects done.  
You can expect an on-boarding process involving safety training (we’re big on safety), some mindful “brain dumps,” and space and time to learn and figure out how to work best. We seek to provide feedback quickly and often, we praise publicly, and deliver critical feedback privately. You can expect to be given meaningful work, to take ownership of features, processes, and to deliver working code and product. We are in this for the long haul. We need your help.
