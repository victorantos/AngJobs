CentML [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;centml.ai]|" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;centml.ai]|</a> VP Engineering | Full-time | US (San Francisco &#x2F; Bay Area), Canada (Toronto)

CentML is on a mission on making modern ML affordable for everyone. Our origin and expertise is in machine learning systems space meaning we know a lot about computer architecture, compilers and ML frameworks. Our big insight is that there is a significant opportunity for system level performance tuning of the workloads so that we can alleviate the current GPU shortage by allowing to utilize mid-tier GPUs (i.e. A10 instead of A100s for inference) without sacrificing on performance.

- We closed a $27M Seed round in Sept 2023 from Gradient Ventures, TR Ventures, Nvidia and Microsoft Azure AI VP Misha Bilenko.

- Our team is 40 people (including contractors &amp; Interns), we plan to be around 60-70 people by the end of 2024
