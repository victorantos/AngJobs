Topsort - Frontend Engineer - Full-time - Globally Remote
Dive into the future of retail media at Topsort (topsort.com). We’re at the forefront, revolutionizing media monetization solutions with a commitment to privacy - a world without third-party cookies.

As a globally dispersed- remote-first team, we celebrate diversity in all its forms. We’re on the lookout for frontend engineers who bring a variety of experience in component and design systems (like shadcn, aria, storybook), are fluent in React, and are open to exploring new languages and technical realms.

You’re the ideal fit if: you’ve built and implemented design systems with reusable components in React, you are passionate about creating high-performance frontends, you’re comfortable in working with Next.js (both pages and app router), you are proactive and like to take ownership, you have worked in full stack environments but have a specialization in frontend.

Our stack: Golang, Python, Typescript (Node.js, Bun), Rust, Postgres, Kafka, Snowflake, Clickhouse, Aws, and more.

Feel free to send your CV&#x2F;GitHub&#x2F;work examples (I’m leading HR at Topsort) if you think this is for you! Apply directly at HR at topsort dot com
