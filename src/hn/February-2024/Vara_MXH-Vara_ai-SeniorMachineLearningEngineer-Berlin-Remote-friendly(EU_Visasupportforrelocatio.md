Vara.ai - Senior Machine Learning Engineer - Berlin - Remote-friendly (EU, Visa support for relocation)

About Vara: Our vision is to find every deadly breast cancer early. We build AI models for breast cancer detection and enable breast cancer screening for underserved public healthcare systems.

The machine learning team at Vara researches, develops and productionizes high-performance AI models for breast cancer detection from mammography images. This requires solving a multi-view perception problem with an emphasis on AI safety to meet very high performance requirements. Building on prior work to recognise trustworthy predictions [1], Vara has built a system that surpasses the metrics of individual radiologists via human-AI collaboration [2], and recognises cancers missed by humans enabling earlier detection [3]. With large-scale, prospective testing of the impact on screening system metrics [4], Vara is the established market leader in one of the most advanced public screening systems in the world and has deployed more than a million AI-assisted radiology reads. Despite clinical metrics being improved by AI in today&#x27;s clinical practice already, we aim for perfection and continue to work towards fundamental solutions of AI for healthcare without drawing boundaries between research and engineering.

Role: As a Senior ML Engineer, you&#x27;ll be involved in all engineering and research aspects that push the boundary of what is possible in AI for breast cancer screening. You&#x27;ll collaborate interdisciplinary, ensuring our AI genuinely improves patient outcomes in all environments.

Exemplary responsibilities:
Research, develop and ship AI models for detecting breast cancer, pushing beyond the published SOTA.
Merge medical insights with AI to tailor our models for global needs.
Validate AI efficacy across diverse datasets, ensuring robust performance.
Develop methods for automated monitoring of models in production. 
Work with a talented team towards breakthroughs in healthcare AI.

Qualifications:
Master or PhD in Computer Science&#x2F;Physics&#x2F;Maths or equivalent practical experience, with a focus on AI&#x2F;ML.
Proven track record of applying ML successfully, ideally to medical images.
Profound knowledge of deep learning (especially CNNs and Transformers).
Experience with real world, large scale datasets.
Fluent engineering (Python, PyTorch&#x2F;TensorFlow&#x2F;Jax, GCP&#x2F;AWS&#x2F;Azure, software development best practices)
Passion for good scientific practice, blending clean formal thinking with engineering.

Offer:
Competitive compensation and benefits.
Work from our stunning office at the Merantix AI Campus Berlin or remotely depending on your needs. 
Integration into the thriving AI startup and ML community via paper reading groups, weekly lunches, and events at the AI Campus as well as conferences.

We are a driven group of researchers and developers who believe in what we create and are committed to its success. In order to make a tangible difference in applied AI and healthcare more accessible globally, we strive for outstanding quality and visionary ideas. We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. The strongest candidates are often humble and we value collaboration over competition. Come work with us!
