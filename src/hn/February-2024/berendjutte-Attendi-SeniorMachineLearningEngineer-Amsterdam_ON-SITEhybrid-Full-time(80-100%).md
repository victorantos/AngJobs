Attendi | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Amsterdam, ON-SITE hybrid | Full-time (80-100%)

Healthcare professionals have to spend too much time on administrative tasks, when they should be spending that time delivering great care. Attendi allows healthcare professionals to report with their voice. This saves them precious time and removes the screen between client and caregiver, allowing more personal and effective care to be given. We provide an extraordinary work environment: getting paid well to work with smart people on things that directly have a positive impact on society.

Healthcare professionals perform all their administrative tasks in electronic health record (EHR) systems. Attendi (voice) enables EHR vendors&#x27; applications by developing speech-to-text and textual understanding APIs.

As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer, you will play a key role in applying the latest research findings to our unique datasets, focusing on the end-to-end development and deployment of AI models. This includes writing production-grade inference code and overseeing the entire lifecycle of these models, from design to deployment.

We are a small startup team with fewer than ten members, which means no bullshit, moving fast, and getting a generous slice of equity. We&#x27;re post product-market fit, profitable, and on the cusp of scaling up in the Dutch market.
