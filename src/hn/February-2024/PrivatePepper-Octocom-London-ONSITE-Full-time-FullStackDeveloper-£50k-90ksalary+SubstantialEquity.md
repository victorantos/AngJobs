Octocom | London | ONSITE | Full-time | Full Stack Developer | £50k-90k salary + Substantial Equity

We’re an early stage startup building a solution to streamline the online shopping experience, guiding customers to their ideal product choice using conversational agents. Essentially, our vision is to replicate the experience of in-store expert shopping advisors, but online.

We’ve launched our product and already have paying clients. So far we are growing substantially fast (4x revenue from past quarter) and our biggest bottleneck is product development speed.

We are looking for a generalist that is capable of quickly building web apps, integrations, scrapers, and algorithms. Additionally, interest&#x2F;experience in LLM applications AND&#x2F;OR information retrieval systems is preferred, yet not required. We don’t have a strict requirement for experience or education; candidates will be judged on merit (speed, skills, intelligence). Stack: TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL.
