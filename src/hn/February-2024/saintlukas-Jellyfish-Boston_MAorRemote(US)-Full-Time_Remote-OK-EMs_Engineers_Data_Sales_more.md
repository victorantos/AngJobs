Jellyfish was started in 2017 as a team of three with one big idea: engineering is the core of modern business, so letâ€™s create and manage it that way!  With the help of our customers, we have built the first Engineering Management Platform (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jellyfish.co&#x2F;product&#x2F;what-is-engineering-management" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jellyfish.co&#x2F;product&#x2F;what-is-engineering-management</a>), providing visibility into engineering organizations, their work, and how they operate. We enable leaders to align engineering decisions with business initiatives and deliver the right software efficiently and on time.

We believe that it takes a diverse team to build the best company we can. Jellyfish welcomes people from all backgrounds and especially encourages applications from members of groups underrepresented in the software industry.
