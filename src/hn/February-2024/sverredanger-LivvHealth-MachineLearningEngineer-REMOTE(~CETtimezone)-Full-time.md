Livv Health | Machine Learning Engineer | REMOTE (~CET timezone) | Full-time

We&#x27;re building a global AI-driven health record. The premise is straightforward: the future of healthcare depends on continuous, data-informed care, with patient-owned health records at its core. It&#x27;s a significant shift, aiming to empower individuals over their health data.

We&#x27;re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join us. This is a fully remote role, ideally within the CET timezone. You&#x27;ll be developing our health record analysis and preventative health models. Your work will directly contribute to how we process, explore, and visualize data, with the larger goal of redefining patient care.

We think you&#x27;ll need experience with LLMs, building models, and data processing pipeline.

Half our team is in Oslo, the rest are across Europe.
If you&#x27;re interested in a role that combines technical challenge with a clear societal benefit, I&#x27;d like to hear from you. You can contact me at sverre at livv.health.
