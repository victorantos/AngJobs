Numeric - Product engineer (4+ YOE) - ONSITE in San Francisco, CA or NYC, NY - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numeric.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numeric.io</a>

Come join us to build the modern accounting &amp; finance platform. Companies like Wealthfront, AngelList, Clearbit, and more depend on Numeric to collaborate &amp; automate their workflows, as well as to monitor, analyze, and share insights on their financial data.

Our mission is to solve the data issues that sit at the root of companies&#x27; problems when it comes to finance and accounting. Companies want up-to-date, accurate, useful financial data as easily and often as possible; good data enables good operations and decision-making. Today&#x27;s systems unfortunately do little to help, and accountants are relegated to fairly manual data entry and error checking. We&#x27;re tackling these foundational problems and we need great engineers.

Looking for product &amp; customer-focused engineers[1]; this will fit if you like to build quickly, contribute to product direction, and know your users.

Bonus points for startup experience and&#x2F;or full-stack experience with Typescript. 4+ YOE.
