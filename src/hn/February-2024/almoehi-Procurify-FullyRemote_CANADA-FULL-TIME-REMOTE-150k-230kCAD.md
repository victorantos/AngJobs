We’re assembling a small but mighty team to build and own the data platform that’s going to be the backbone of the business&#x27; strategic shift towards automation and data-driven products in the procure-to-pay industry. You’ll get the opportunity to work on the largest technology initiative since the company&#x27;s founding about 10y ago. An opportunity with massive impact, visibility and full buy-in from the senior leadership and executives.

Our mission is to enable our gang of 40+ product engineers to deliver data-driven products and features.

Profile (roughly):

- great personality

- solid engineering skills with Python and pyspark &#x2F; deltalake

- data architecture and data modelling

- CI&#x2F;CD, testing and quality tests for data pipelines

- experience with databricks and its recent products highly desired (deltalake, autoloader, unity catalog, structured streaming, DLT, DAB, ...)

Some highlights:

- 4-day work week (every Friday off)

- Well funded as we just raised 50m in series C

- Excellent senior leadership with a human-centric culture

- Great business momentum and growth trajectory
