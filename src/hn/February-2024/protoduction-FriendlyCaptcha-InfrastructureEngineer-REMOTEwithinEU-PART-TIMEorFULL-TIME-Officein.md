Friendly Captcha - Infrastructure Engineer - REMOTE within EU - PART-TIME or FULL-TIME - Office in Munich, Germany - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;friendlycaptcha.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;friendlycaptcha.com</a>

At Friendly Captcha we do one thing and we do it well: we protect websites from malicious actors and bots.

We provide privacy-friendly and accessible anti-bot solutions that don’t annoy users with tasks like clicking fire hydrants. We make the internet a bit better every day by winning over customers currently using Google reCAPTCHA.

We’re a fast-growing, profitable, fully bootstrapped company. Our revenue mostly comes from medium to large European enterprise and governments.

A great fit would be someone pragmatic, who prefers to keep things simple (perhaps boring is the right word?). Good knowledge of modern DevOps&#x2F;SRE practices is expected (IaC, GitOps, etc...).

Our engineering team is fully remote across Europe, we meet up once per quarter or so. You can work either 4 or 5 days per week, fully remote or (partially) from our Munich office. Please note that we ONLY consider candidates located within the EU.
