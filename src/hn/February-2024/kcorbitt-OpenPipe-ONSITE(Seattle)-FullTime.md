OpenPipe | ONSITE (Seattle) | Full Time

Hi HN! I&#x27;m Kyle, the founder of OpenPipe, which you might recognize from some of our recent HN threads:

- Mistral 7B Fine-Tune Optimized <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38712802">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38712802</a>

- Is AI the next crypto? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38193978">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38193978</a>

- Fine-tune your own Llama 2 to replace GPT-3.5&#x2F;5 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37484135">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37484135</a>

This is a unique opportunity to be hire #2 at a fast-growing startup that already has significant revenue and exploding demand. If you&#x27;re interested please email me at kyle@openpipe.ai. You don&#x27;t need to have any experience developing AI systems to apply, although this is a fantastic role for someone who wants to develop those skills. You do need experience with full-stack development (NextJS experience is a plus).

Our ideal candidate is a self-starter who&#x27;s excited to own big pieces of the product vision and comfortable operating with uncertainty.

Our stack:

- Typescript+NextJS for the user-facing app

- Python+Ray for model training and inference code

- Postgres for the DB
