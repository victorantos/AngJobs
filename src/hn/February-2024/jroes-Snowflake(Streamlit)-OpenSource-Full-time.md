We&#x27;re hiring in many engineering roles on the Streamlit team, and many neighboring teams at Snowflake. At highest priority, I&#x27;m looking for an Engineering Manager to lead our Streamlit Open Source team. Streamlit is a popular open-source project that&#x27;s changing the way people visualize data and build interactive apps. We&#x27;re seeking someone who loves UI&#x2F;UX + Data, a background in managing full-stack teams, and a drive to innovate in the open-source space.

Our ideal candidate has 3+ years of experience in leadership roles, a startup mentality, and high energy to champion Streamlit. This is a really special role for us. Proficiency in Python and React is a plus, along with experience in data science or interactive visualization tools.
