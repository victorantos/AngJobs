We are a high-growth, product-focused manufacturer, bringing high-value medical devices to market using a proprietary Additive Manufacturing technology called Resin Infused Powder Lithography (RIPL).

We are seeking an experienced Full Stack Web Developer to contribute to the development of internal and customer facing web applications.

We make very very small metal parts using an entirely in-house-developed hardware and software stack. You&#x27;d be the third software engineer in a close-knit, interdisciplinary team.

We are flexible on our tech stack but right now it&#x27;s a mix of Python, JS, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, and Flask running on on-prem machines. If you have experience&#x2F;interest in 3D rendering, CAD, computational geometry, and industrial automation, that&#x27;s a plus. Closer to the industrial automation and 3D processing side its a mix of Python, C++, C, and Rust.

If you really enjoy having a physical result to look at and being close to your users. This might be a good fit for you.

Please email careers@triolabs.com with your resume, any links to your portfolio &#x2F; code, and a short cover letter explaining your relevant experience.
