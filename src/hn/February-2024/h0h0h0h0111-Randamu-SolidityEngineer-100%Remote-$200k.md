Randamu - Solidity Engineer - 100% Remote - $200k

Randamu is a well-funded startup building novel network infrastructure using threshold cryptography.
We steward the drand open source project¹, a randomness beacon that serves hundreds of millions of requests per month.

We&#x27;re seeking a solidity engineer to help us integrate our randomness beacon into more blockchain ecosystems (drand is currently a core part of Filecoin), as well as ship an entirely new threshold decryption network.

The team is small, so the ideal candidate would also have some frontend or backend engineering experience and have a good knowledge of cryptography. 
The engineering team is in Europe, so being close to european timezones would be a plus, but not a dealbreaker.

We offer unlimited time off, an annual conference budget, a hardware budget and meet occasionally in new cities to hang out.
