gptengineer.app &#x2F; Lovable | ONSITE+HYBRID | Stockholm &#x2F; London | Full-Time | Founding Engineer, Founding Designer, Commercial Lead

Lovable is made up of a team of pragmatic previous (YC) founders and CTOs, set on being the first to make autonomous code generation work.

This is a hard problem. We believe we can do it by selecting a limited domain, allowing humans to take over and crucially â€“ carefully selecting a single &#x27;AI-first&#x27; tech stack of open-source tech, that us engineers love to maintain. That we optimise our system of fine-tuned LLMs (+LMMs) to do well in.

We believe that rapid experimentation and hiring the brightest and most ambitious minds is the way we make this work. If you&#x27;re interested, please apply! You&#x27;d be one of the first employees and have a big impact in shaping our product and company.

We&#x27;re looking for:

- Founding Designer, who loves understanding the user, technical products, and always think about how products they interact with could be more intuitive

- Commercial Lead, who will ideate and execute on our partnerships and commercial efforts

- Founding Engineer, joining our team of product engineers building the software that builds other software.
