Over the past year Radar has been used from 100M+ devices doing 10,000 qps. We are are a small but mighty engineering team (13 engineers!). We&#x27;re based in NYC with our HQ in Union Square.
There&#x27;s a ton of opportunity to make an impact and work on a variety of things, as we&#x27;re a pretty fluid team:

- Mobile (e.g. open-source mobile infrastructure, building a control system that automatically configures optimizing battery-life and location accuracy for different use-cases over time)

- Full-Stack (e.g. build tools to visualize and debug location data at scale)

What you&#x27;ll do:

- Work on core Radar mobile infrastructure built with Kotlin, Objective-C, Swift, as well as wrapper SDKs written in React Native, Flutter and Capacitor.

- Work on full-stack features across the frontend and backend

- Embody our &quot;Walk a mile&quot; value by walking around to QA and debug the Radar SDK

- Push the limits of what is possible with location services on iOS and Android

- Have your work run on 100&#x27;s of millions of devices

- Talk to Radar customers and prospects, hear their feedback, incorporate it into your work and make them successful
