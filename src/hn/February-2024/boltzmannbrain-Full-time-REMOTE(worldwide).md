Pasteur Labs – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pasteurlabs.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pasteurlabs.ai</a> - Full-time - REMOTE (worldwide) - Sr+ Engineers (in Applied Simulation, Data Engineering, Product Dev, HCI Dev, 3D Game&#x2F;Physics Engines): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simulation.science&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simulation.science&#x2F;careers</a>

At Pasteur Labs, we develop computing technologies that enable scientific and industrial challenges to be approached in new ways: that is, a first of its kind AI-native, developer-first platform for modeling &amp; simulation (M&amp;S). Our product aim is to enable in-silico playgrounds for human-machine teams experimenting and building in industrial R&amp;D, energy security, &amp; advanced manufacturing arenas.  As a public-benefit for-profit startup, our mission is Nobel-Turing [1] technologies to advance science and society for all humankind.

The pursuit calls for industry hardened and intellectually curious builders who thrive in interdisciplinary territories that are often less-traveled. The team brings deep, diverse expertise from Deepmind, Cerebras, Vicarious, SpaceX, NASA, CERN, Sandia, Nvidia, Autodesk, and more.  With fresh venture funding and Fortune500 customers (+dozens more on the waitlist), we&#x27;re looking for ambitious, intellectually curious software engineers that can consistently contribute in non-trivial, impressive ways as we ship and scale our flagship product platform — some call it &quot;live intelligent digital twins&quot; and others say &quot;cyberphysical testbeds for AGI&quot;, while most view Pasteur Labs product catalogue as &quot;Unity for industrial R&amp;D.&quot;

With HQ in Brooklyn NY [2], we are an internationally distributed team running remote full-time — from San Diego to Stockholm and everywhere in-between. The full team gathers 2x per year for Pasteur Labs &quot;onsites&quot;, alternating sites such as Montreal, Amsterdam, Austin, London, NYC etc.
