Urlbox | TypeScript &#x2F; Next.js &#x2F; DevOps (k8s) | REMOTE (UK) | Full-time |  £30K to £60K | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urlbox.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urlbox.com</a>

Urlbox helps web developers render the web with precision. We&#x27;ve been focused on generating screenshots, images and PDFs from HTML or URLs for over a decade. Our customers include over 500 design or compliance led organisations. They depend on us to get the intricacies of browser rendering right so they can focus on their core products and services.

We&#x27;re bootstrapped, profitable and ready to add a third full-time engineer to our team. Our stack is primarily TypeScript. It&#x27;s a bonus if you&#x27;re also interested in learning how to orchestrate and scale headless browsers on our Kubernetes clusters. There&#x27;s also opportunities to create&#x2F;maintain libraries and SDK&#x27;s in a range of other languages.

We&#x27;re excited to hear from people early in their tech career as well as more experienced folk.
