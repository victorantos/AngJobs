Do you work in AI and want to help cancer patients make better and more personalized healthcare choices? Join us at ArteraAI!

We&#x27;re building AI-driven cancer care products that enable clinicians to prognosticate individual patient outcomes and predict therapy benefits. We create multi-modal ML models for cancer tests that integrate self-supervised learning computer vision models of gigapixel-scale histopathology images with patient clinical data, and we build infrastructure to deploy them to customers globally.

We&#x27;ve raised over $100M, and we&#x27;re expanding our AI team to enhance our ML tech and grow our reach.  We have two open positions for candidates experienced in computer vision engineering and research experience (past work on cancer digital pathology is a plus), starting as soon as possible:
