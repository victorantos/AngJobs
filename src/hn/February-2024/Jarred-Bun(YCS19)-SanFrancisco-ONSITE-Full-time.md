Bun (YC S19) | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bun.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bun.sh</a> | San Francisco | ONSITE | Full-time

Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner, and bundler. Our 2024 goal is to replace Node.js as the default server-side JavaScript runtime. We launched Bun 1.0 back in September: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BsnCpESUEqM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BsnCpESUEqM</a>, and it&#x27;s been a really exciting 6-ish months seeing developers use Bun at companies like X (Twitter), Midjourney and Brex.

Today we have over 2,000 issues open in our GitHub repo <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oven-sh&#x2F;bun&#x2F;issues">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oven-sh&#x2F;bun&#x2F;issues</a>, and while we love seeing people use Bun, it&#x27;s clear that we need to grow the team to help make Bun more reliable and implement missing features blocking companies from switching to Bun.

We are hiring systems engineers in San Francisco to help make Bun more reliable and implement new runtime APIs and services. Bun is written in a mix of Zig and C++, but experience with Zig is not required (People with a C&#x2F;C++ background tend to pick up Zig quickly). Working on Bun often involves reading WebKit&#x2F;JavaScriptCore source code, Zig standard library source code, Darwin XNU source code, and sometimes Linux kernel source code. We are a well-funded early-stage startup (9 people currently). Our office is in the financial district in San Francisco
