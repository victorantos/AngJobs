Fondant | AI-powered 3D tools | Founding Engineers | Full time, REMOTE

Fondant is on a mission to make 3D more accessible. We are building a platform that harnesses the latest advancements in generative AI&#x2F;ML to create 3D assets instantly with a few words (or images). Traditional 3D tools are often intimidating (think Blender) and can take hours of YouTube tutorials to learn. We are leveraging the lessons learnt from building traditional tooling over the last decade + SOTA work on 3D reconstruction, NeRFs, gaussian splatting and image generation.

We have an early product + users + funding.

We are hiring for founding engineering roles for AI and Web&#x2F;Frontend. If you can write good code, can work independently and thrive on solving fuzzy problems that often don&#x27;t have answers on stack-overflow or ChatGPT&#x2F;GPT4, you will be a good fit.

For ML&#x2F;AI roles experience with ML infrastructure, diffusion models, 3D reconstruction, 3D priors (like Instant3D&#x2F;LRM), NeRFs, gaussian splats, pytorch would be a huge plus.

For Web engineering&#x2F;Frontend role, experience with Javascript, Typescript, WebGL and ThreeJS, shaders, game engines would be amazing.

If you&#x27;re excited about pushing the boundaries of 3D technology, reach out at my username [at] fondant.design with a short blurb about yourself and link(s) to a personal contribution(s) e.g., open-source code, research publications, cool demo of something you built etc.
