oxa.tech - UK, USA &amp; Canada - REMOTE &#x2F; REMOTE-FIRST depending on role

Oxa&#x27;s self-driving software platform is transforming the way people and goods are transported â€” safely, securely and efficiently.

We&#x27;re hiring over 150 people this year. ML, Simulation, C++, Python, Frontend &amp; Backend Web Engineers, Field Engineers (hands-on calibration of HW on vehicle) etc etc... Too much to summarise!

The AV market is in a tight spot right now, but our approach of delivering safe, robust solutions for relevant and commercially-viable use cases NOW is seeing us sprint ahead of the wider market struggles.
