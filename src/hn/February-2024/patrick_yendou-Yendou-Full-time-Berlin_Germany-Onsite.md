Yendou - Full-time - Berlin, Germany - Onsite - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yendou.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yendou.io</a>

Yendou is the first CRM designed to help Clinical Operation teams to scale and accelerate the allocation of Clinical Trials to clinics. This year we will ship an AI Co-Pilot for Clinical Operation teams

Right now, most products in the healthcare space suck, and we are looking for great people to help us change that! If Yendou is successful, you will be able to tell your grandkids that you worked on something that saved human lives :)
