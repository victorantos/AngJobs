Vidrovr Inc | US | Remote | Full-Time

Vidrovr makes video useful. We use machine learning to turn disorganized heaps of media and tangles of live feeds into beautifully structured metadata to drive actions and business decisions for our users. We enable previously impossible applications, at previously impossible scales.

We are a small team with self-sustaining - and growing - revenues. Our notable major partners include The AP, the USAF, CNBC, the German Marshall Fund, DHS, FOX sports, and more.

Vidrovr fosters an open, supportive engineering culture emphasizing curiosity, self-teaching, and fearlessness. Engineering is a very small team with fewer than ten members, and there is ample opportunity to learn outside your domain of expertise. Our organization is fairly flat: you&#x27;ll have direct access to company leadership, insight into strategic conversations, and avenues for direct involvement in major decisions.

We are fully remote. Vidrovr does not currently maintain a physical office. About half of our team is based in New York, with other members in Knoxville, Atlanta, Boston, Seattle, and Mexico City. Being fully remote, we highly value good communication skills!

Vidrovr provides unlimited PTO, and we&#x27;re serious about it. We periodically require engineers to take time off if they have not recently. We value your independence: we expect quality engineering, not your soul.
