Douro Labs | REMOTE (US or EU timezones) | Full-time | $150k-250k + token incentives and annual bonuses

Douro Labs is building Pyth Network, an open source blockchain oracle delivering high frequency and low latency market data.

We have multiple roles open:

1. Senior &#x2F; Staff Software Engineer -- Develop backend services in Rust, work on smart contracts in various languages, develop and optimize a distributed blockchain.

2. Staff Frontend Engineer -- Take frontend concepts through from design through implementation. Build beautiful data visualizations and web3 applications.

3. Senior Business Intelligence Analyst -- Collect and analyze product metrics to understand usage and growth.

4. Developer Relations Manager -- Work with developers building on Pyth Network to develop solutions and identify product gaps. Iterate on product features, documentation, and anything else required to produce a seamless experience for our users.
