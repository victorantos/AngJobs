Ember | Full-Stack Software Engineer | Edinburgh, UK | Onsite | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ember.to&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ember.to&#x2F;</a>

Ember is building the future of public transport — convenient, affordable, connected and zero-emission. Our goal is to make it easier and more enjoyable to get from A to B with Ember than it is with your own car.

We’re a tech company, not a traditional bus operator. We&#x27;ve built a platform that coordinates our entire operation – everything from monitoring vehicles and controlling chargers to selling tickets and calculating ETAs. This allows us to use electric buses more intensively than anyone else in the world, leading to a massive emissions reduction. It also helps us provide a much better passenger experience, with innovative features like demand-responsive stops.

We’re still tiny, with two routes and 24 buses. The challenge is to scale this 100x whilst staying lean, increasing efficiency and delivering an even better product experience. We’ve recently raised equity from some of Europe’s leading climate VCs and are looking for mission-driven individuals who can help take us to the next level.
