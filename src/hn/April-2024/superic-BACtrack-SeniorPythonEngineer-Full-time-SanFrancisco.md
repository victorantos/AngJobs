BACtrack | Senior Python Engineer | Full-time | San Francisco | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.BACtrack.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.BACtrack.com</a>

We make breathalyzers from the ground up. Everything from the hardware and firmware to the software. If you were to go to your local drugstore or BestBuy&#x2F;Target&#x2F;etc to buy a breathalyzer, you&#x27;re buying one of ours. We are hiring for our software engineering team to build our next generation stack.

This position will be working in Python on AWS to build out our APIs. Do you like building APIs and working with large datasets?

BACtrack is a &quot;20 year old startup&quot; in that we build our own hardware, we have customers that pay for our services, the team is the right size that it&#x27;s possible to know everyone, and each individual can have a large impact.

Our office is in San Francisco (North Beach) but we&#x27;re fully remote. The local software engineering team comes in to the office once a week but it&#x27;s optional. We&#x27;re currently hiring in California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas â€“ if remote is your preference, you&#x27;ll need to be in one of those states.

Come build cool things with us! Email me at Eric dot Willis at our domain name.
