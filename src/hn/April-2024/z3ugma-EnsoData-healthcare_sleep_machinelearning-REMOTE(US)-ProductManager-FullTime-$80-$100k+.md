* Sleep is vital to recharging mentally, restoring our bodies physically, and fighting off disease. Sleep is so core to our health that it&#x27;s the activity we all spend most of our life doing.

* Yet sleep disorders are some of the most underdiagnosed health conditions on the planet, with an estimated 80% of obstructive sleep apnea patients undiagnosed and untreated

* EnsoData uses machine learning, integration with esoteric binary data storage formats, and Flask-powered Python APIs with React SPA frontends to automate sleep study scoring and give sleep clinicians tools to find and help patients with sleep disorders.

* We&#x27;re hiring a product manager to manage the discovery process, pitch product opportunities and analyze opportunity costs, and break down projects into whiteboard mock sketches and releaseable slices.
