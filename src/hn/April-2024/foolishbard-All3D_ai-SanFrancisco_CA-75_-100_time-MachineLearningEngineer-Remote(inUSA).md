All3D.ai - San Francisco, CA - 75%-100% time - Machine Learning Engineer - Remote (in USA)

All3D is a 3D generative platform, built to supply 3D assets to ecommerce businesses. We&#x27;ve been around for four years and have reached PMF, looking to bring on additional ML talent to automate more of the workflow.

If you are familiar with the difference between NeRF and NeuS, then you&#x27;ll be a great candidate. Background in diffusion models is a requirement.
