Hartwig Medical Foundation | Software Developer ACTIN team | Amsterdam, NL | Hybrid On-site

We&#x27;re a foundation that has been developing a diagnostic whole genome sequencing test for tumors, to speed-up the uptake of personalized cancer treatments for patients in the Netherlands. While the developed diagnostic test results in a complete and high quality list of applicable biomarkers per patient, we see that it is still difficult for the patients to get a personalized (experimental) treatment due to the very large number of options and frequently changing treatment options in a still very manual hospital set-up.

We&#x27;re trying to solve this by building an algorithm that not only takes into account the molecular data that we generate for a patient, but also the clinical data. We use this data to create a report that contains a comprehensive overview of standard of care treatments and trials that are available for the patient, as well as a patient-like-me approach that helps clinicians in their decision making.

We&#x27;re looking for developers that can help us with integrating hospital infrastructure and data with our cloud-setup. This involves working on-site from within hospitals on some days of the week, making sure that the creation of an ACTIN report is end-to-end automated and contains all relevant data. We work on Google Cloud Platform, code mainly in Kotlin and don&#x27;t have a strict hierarchy (for example, we all have the same job title).
