Synthesia - Senior-level+ Fullstack Software Engineers - Remote (European timezones)

We&#x27;re building a generative-AI powered, enterprise-grade video creation platform and we&#x27;ve found strong product market fit. We&#x27;re at Series C, have a long runway, and are seeing hockey stick growth.

Salaries range from £100,000 &#x2F; 100,000 EUR to £150,000 &#x2F; 150,000 EUR.

We look for Senior-level engineers to own bets and workstreams on projects that last months at a time.

Some of the areas we&#x27;re hiring for our Growth (building an experimentation platform), DevEx (building a RDE), Moderation (extending our moderation and red teaming capabilities).

We look for engineers who have seen scale and desire ownership.
