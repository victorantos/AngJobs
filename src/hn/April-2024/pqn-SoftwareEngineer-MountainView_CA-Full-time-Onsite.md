Codeium (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeium.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeium.com</a>) - Software Engineer - Mountain View, CA - Full-time - Onsite

We&#x27;re working on AI tools for developers (autocomplete, chat, and more unannounced things). We train our own LLMs from scratch and have over 1M downloads across our surfaces. We have many paying enterprise customers and have raised a total of $93M from Kleiner Perkins, Greenoaks, and Founders Fund.

We&#x27;re hiring for many roles, but in particular are looking for software generalists and Deployed Engineers, which are more heavy on the customer interaction than code (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;codeium&#x2F;fd2ca49f-ae99-487c-8a52-75d2f88afcfe">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;codeium&#x2F;fd2ca49f-ae99-487c-8a52-75d...</a>). No ML or systems experience required. We also have fall software engineering internships available.

You can see all the open roles and apply here (we pretty much look at every single application): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeium.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeium.com&#x2F;careers</a>
