gptengineer.app &#x2F; Lovable | ONSITE+HYBRID | Stockholm &#x2F; London | Full-Time | Founding Engineers, Founding Designer

Lovable consists of a team of pragmatic previous founders, CTOs, IOI gold medalists, set on being the first to make autonomous code generation work.

This is a hard problem. We believe we can do it by selecting a limited domain, a great AI driven UX and carefully selecting an &#x27;AI-first&#x27; tech stack of open-source, that us engineers love to maintain. And optimise our system of fine-tuned LLMs (+LMMs) to do well there.

We believe that rapid experimentation and hiring the brightest and most ambitious minds is the way we make this work. You&#x27;d be one of the first employees and have a big impact in shaping our product and company.

In particular, we&#x27;re looking for:
- Founding Designer, who loves understanding the user, technical products, and always think about how products they interact with could be more intuitive
- Founding Engineer, joining our team of AI and product engineers building the software that builds other software.
