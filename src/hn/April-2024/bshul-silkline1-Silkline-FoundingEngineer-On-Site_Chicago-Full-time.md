Silkline | Founding Engineer | On-Site, Chicago | Full-time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silkline.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silkline.ai&#x2F;</a>
Procurement is broken - Silkine is building the platform to fix it. Executing, tracking, and managing large purchases today is a Sisyphean task. A never-ending spiral of spreadsheets, manual PDF munging, and supplier wrangling. We know that we can do better. Come help our team (ex-Palantir&#x2F;Pave, ex-Deloitte&#x2F;Lockheed Martin) build a more transparent and reliable global supply chain.

We are looking for an ambitious, full-stack engineer who wants an impactful role with a TON of product ownership. The opportunity is massive, and we are just at the beginning.

Tech stack:

- App: Typescript, Next, Vercel, GraphQL, Hasura, Postgres (Aurora), OpenAI

- Integration&#x2F;Infra: Python, Dagster, Airbyte, Pulumi
