FlowDeploy | Product Engineer, Bioinformatics Engineer| Full-time | REMOTE or ONSITE | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flowdeploy.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flowdeploy.com</a>

FlowDeploy builds dev tools for bioinformatics, and we&#x27;re looking for a product-minded software engineer and a bioinformatics engineer. I think a former or future founder would do well in this role.

Curiosity matters more than domain-specific experience in bioinformatics, although some bioinformatics context is helpful: understanding if what you&#x27;ve built solves a problem requires talking to users and understanding them.

You would be working in a few key areas of our product:

- Improving our integration with bioinformatics pipelining languages like Nextflow and Snakemake.

- Building our core API. This is currently written with Express&#x2F;Node.js with a Postgres database.

- Building the UI for launching, monitoring, and sharing bioinformatics pipelines and data. This is currently written in React with Typescript.

- Improving our pipeline execution. This is mostly in AWS Batch.

- Improving our data handling. Most raw data is stored in S3, with metadata in a Postgres database.

We&#x27;re a very small team, and we plan to stay small until we have strong product-market fit. We&#x27;re funded by Y Combinator, have revenue from the FlowDeploy product, and can keep going for years without raising additional funding.
