Steer | Remote | Europe&#x2F;Americas (UTC-6 - UTC+2) | Full-time | Senior Platform Engineer - Kubernetes, AWS

Steer offers a market-leading CRM ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steercrm.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steercrm.com</a> ) suite for automotive repair shops, complete with text messaging, email automation, direct mail integration, reputation management, appointment reminders, declined&#x2F;recommended services, and many other features.

We have a large, modern infrastructure but there&#x27;s a lot of growth, scaling, automating, new solutions and improvements to do.

You MUST have extensive experience with:

- Kubernetes (EKS preferred) - 4 years

- AWS - 4 years

- Terraform - 4 years

- CI&#x2F;CD (Github Actions preferred)

- a modern programming language (Go preferred)

- working fully remotely in a startup environment

To ensure good collaboration with the rest of the team you must be located somewhere in UTC-6 - UTC+2 and be a confident communicator.

It&#x27;s a very busy environment and you need to be comfortable with autonomous work, changing priorities, ad-hoc requests and owning the delivery.

This is a fully remote, no travel required position. We have very few meetings, we&#x27;re light on process, with mostly flat hierarchy.

If you&#x27;re a truly senior Platform Engineer please apply at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;steercrm&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4292552007" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;steercrm&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4292552007</a>
