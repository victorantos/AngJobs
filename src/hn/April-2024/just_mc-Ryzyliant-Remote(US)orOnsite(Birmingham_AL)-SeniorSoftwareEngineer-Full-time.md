Ryzyliant - Remote (US) or Onsite (Birmingham, AL) - Senior Software Engineer - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryzyliant.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryzyliant.com</a>

Our mission is to save lives by streamlining the 911 emergency response workflow.

Ryzyliant provides solutions for 911 Call Centers (PSAPs) in the United States. Existing PSAP solutions in the US are generally comprised of very poorly integrated systems from several different vendors all of which must be used in parallel to complete the emergency dispatch process. Imagine having your IDE on one computer, your email client on another and your browser on yet another and there is an emergency in progress; this is the work environment of dispatch operators in the US. Our mission at Ryzyliant is to provide a unified and streamlined tool that is designed to facilitate the end to end workflow of the dispatch operator, speeding dispatch operations and reducing errors.

We are using leading edge local-first browser applications to provide the benefits of the cloud with the stand-alone survivability of traditional on-premise solutions.

<pre><code>  - Advanced TypeScript
  - Design patterns and best practices for TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript
