Cartesian Systems (MIT Startup) - Senior Software Engineer - Mobile (Android) - Boston  (on-site) - Full-time

I’m the CEO of Cartesian Systems, a seed-stage MIT startup on a mission to map the physical world at unprecedented scale and precision. Our team brings together world-class technical expertise and startup experience, and we’re building a first-of-its-kind product to solve problems in indoor logistics for retail and supply chain.

As we gear up for our product launch (and scaling) this year, we’re looking to hire a senior software engineer to lead our mobile development (native Android) and amplify mobile development velocity. By joining the team at this stage, you’ll play a foundational role in shaping the product and company culture.
