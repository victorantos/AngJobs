MAAT - Founding Engineer - Remote (EU + UK) - Full-time - Salary + Equity

We are on a mission to enhance gym management and connect the sports community.  We are looking for a Senior Engineer eager to grow into a CTO role.

Our tech stack:

<pre><code>  - Flutter

  - Typescript

  - NodeJS

  - NextJS
</code></pre>
Besides writing a lot of code to build the foundation of the product, youâ€™ll lead development, design architecture, and scale our tech.

When you are away from the keyboard you are a friendly, skilled communicator and possibly doing some kind of sport (if that is BJJ that&#x27;s a plus!).

Competitive salary and equity on offer.

Interested? Email me at stefano@joinmaat.com with your CV and some cool things about you.

PLEASE: Avoid ChatGPT-like applications, Cover Letters, and most importantly avoid calling me Hiring Manager.
