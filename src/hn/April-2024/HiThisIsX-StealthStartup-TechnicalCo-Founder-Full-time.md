Stealth Startup | Technical Co-Founder | Bay Area or LA based preferred; remote possible | Full-time

Looking for a technical co-founder interested in re-inventing the payment processing space from a B2C outlook.

Current methods were initially built to make integration into native enterprise platforms seamless have now become expensive, lack meaningful innovation &amp; are no longer reliable to meet customer needs. The oversaturated number of processing offerings being pushed by larger players creates a fragmented value proposition that we should undertake to challenge &amp; change.

If interested, please reach out to me at MarqueeX.01@gmail.com and we can set up time to speak further.

For refence, my background includes time at SpaceX, finance, and joining &#x2F; leading a startup to exit.
