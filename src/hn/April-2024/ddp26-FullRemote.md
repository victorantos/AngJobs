FutureSearch (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futuresearch.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futuresearch.ai</a>) | Full Remote | Full-Stack Eng &#x2F; Research Eng &#x2F; Research Scientist

FutureSearch gives unbiased, deeply-researched answers to hard questions about the world, and always gives a concrete answer.

Businesses need much better answers than ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc. can currently give. My cofounder and I are the former CTO and Head of AI at Metaculus, and our  edge comes from implementing the workflows of expert forecasters. FutureSearch creates models from scratch on novel domains when a customer asks a question, and we test our claims against what actually happens.

We&#x27;re an 8-month old, 5-person, fully-remote company. Email me directly with your resume if you&#x27;re interested in a role, dan at futuresearch dot ai.
