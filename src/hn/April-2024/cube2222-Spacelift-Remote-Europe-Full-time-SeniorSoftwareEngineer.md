Spacelift | Remote | Europe | Full-time | Senior Software Engineer

We&#x27;re a VC-funded startup building an automation platform for Infrastructure-as-Code, adding a Policy-as-Code layer above it, in order to make IaC usable in bigger companies, where you have to take care of state consistency, selective permissions, a usable git flow, etc.

On the backend we&#x27;re using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We&#x27;re looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps&#x27;y stuff sometimes (because in a way it&#x27;s the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you&#x27;d have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.

Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don&#x27;t give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. We&#x27;ve also got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.
