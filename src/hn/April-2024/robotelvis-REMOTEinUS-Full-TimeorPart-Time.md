New Public (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newpublic.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newpublic.org</a>) - REMOTE in US - Full-Time or Part-Time

We are hiring a software engineer to work on Public Service Incubator.

New Public is working with a group of Public Service Media organizations across Europe and North America to create a new publicly-owned public-service online platform that is designed to naturally encourage productive discourse between people who see the world differently.

Normally creating a new online social space is super hard (network effects and all that) but our partners have the credibility needed to make a new space high status, and the power to direct the attention of millions of people. So we think we actually have a decent shot.

We&#x27;ve built a prototype that our partners and test users are pretty excited about, and now it&#x27;s time to turn it into a real high quality product.

We are particularly interested in people with experience shipping social products, an ability to work anywhere in the stack, and a deep interest in finding ways to help people who see the world differently understand each other and work productively together.

Stack: React (Native) | Node.JS | NoSQL | OpenAI

New Public is a non-profit that was founded by Eli Pariser (The Filter Bubble, Upworthy, MoveOn) and Talia Stroud (Prof at UT Austin) with the vision that we should focus not just on how to reduce the harms of online spaces, but how to design them so that they make good things happen. Public Service Incubator is one of our flagship projects.
