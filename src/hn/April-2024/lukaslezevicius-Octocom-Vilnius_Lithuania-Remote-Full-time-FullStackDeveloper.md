Octocom | Vilnius, Lithuania | Remote | Full-time | Full Stack Developer | Competitive Salary (Eastern&#x2F;Central Europe) + Substantial Equity

We’re an early stage startup that aims to fully automate customer support in the e-commerce sector. Our LLM-powered support agents are already resolving 80%+ of inquiries for many businesses from diverse backgrounds. Shoppers can enjoy receiving instant support, in their native language, in any channel, 24&#x2F;7, for any query imaginable.

We’ve launched our product back in June and have raised a pre-seed round from the founders of one of the largest e-commerce marketing SaaS businesses. Our biggest bottleneck at the moment is product development speed.

We are looking for a full-stack generalist that is capable of quickly building web apps, integrations, scrapers, and algorithms. A bachelor degree in CS or equivalent professional experience is required.

LLM or AI experience is not required. You will get the chance to learn the cutting edge AI engineering techniques on the job, as well as work on a wide range of web development projects.

Stack: TypeScript (backend and frontend), React, PostgreSQL.
