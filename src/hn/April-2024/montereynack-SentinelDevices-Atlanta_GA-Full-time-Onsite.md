Sentinel Devices | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sentineldevices.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sentineldevices.com&#x2F;</a> | Atlanta, GA | Full-time | Onsite

Sentinel Devices develops &quot;zero-cloud&quot; anomaly detection devices for industrial machinery. Our platform, OTAware, reduces the time users have to spend identifying and tracking down issues in their machines by analyzing machine signals and providing engineers with useful pointers on what&#x27;s going on, as well as identifying signs of issues that would otherwise go unnoticed. Our unique approach is we do EVERYTHING, including data storage, ML training and decision-making, entirely on embedded devices - we never send data outside of the customer facility. This means that we are an instant buy-in for security-sensitive customers or customers with remote operations, such as defense or oil &amp; gas.

We are ACTIVELY hiring for founding software engineer and AI&#x2F;ML engineer roles: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sentinel-devices.breezy.hr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sentinel-devices.breezy.hr&#x2F;</a>
