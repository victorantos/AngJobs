Ideal Medtech - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idealmedtech.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idealmedtech.com</a> - Senior Systems Engineer - Senior Software Engineer - Asheville, NC - Full-time - ONSITE preferred, FULLY REMOTE with the right skill set (USA only)

Ideal Medtech is a clinical stage medical device startup looking to control every feasible physiological parameter in the hospital -- starting with glucose. This technology has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives a year, billions of healthcare dollars, and thousands of nursing hours.

We&#x27;re looking to hire a senior engineer with experience developing medical devices in the US or European Union. You&#x27;d be working directly with me, the technical founder, owning product development and documentation required for three Class II 501(k) submissions (pumps, control software, and maybe helping a strategic as needed with sensors). Some (but not all) standards you should be familiar with: 60601, 62304, FHIR

You would be working directly with a team at a contract manufacturer (CM) we&#x27;ve done the initial product development with, and would be involved in high-level technical decision making, software development, and helping the CM with documentation.

As an early hire, you&#x27;d have the option to take equity as part of your payment.

If any of the following skills describe you, feel free to send me an email (see profile):

- Medical Device Cybersecurity

- Firmware Development

- Distributed Computing

- Formal Verification

- Repeatable Simulation

- V&amp;V

- Physiological Closed-Loop Control

- Knowledge-Based Systems

- Reinforcement Learning

- Blood-based Sensing

Please include your CV, salary expectations, timeline for hiring, and any open-source code you&#x27;re proud of and would want to talk about!
