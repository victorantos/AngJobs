Arcadia &#x2F; Genability - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arcadia.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arcadia.com</a> - REMOTE T-04:00 -- T-07:00 - Senior SW Eng - Climate Tech

Arcadia is the technology company empowering energy innovators and consumers to fight the climate crisis. Our software and APIs digitalize an industry held back by outdated systems and institutions by enabling modern access to the data and clean energy needed to make a decarbonized energy grid possible.

My Energy Analytics group builds data modeling products to predict energy costs and calculates the benefits adding DERs like solar or battery storage. If you got a quote to put solar panels on your roof, odds are your ROI calculation flowed through our Genability Signal and Switch APIâ€™s by way of our enterprise customers. We build performance models of battery systems, and we use ML techniques to predict energy datasets. Solving the climate crisis requires a mass deployment of clean energy technologies, and our products give the economic insights to most effectively deploy projects today.

We are looking for an analytical and quantitative senior engineer with both Java and Python web application experience -- you need to be comfortable with numbers. React experience a bonus. You should be able to demonstrate domain knowledge in an esoteric or regulated field (energy industry preferred). You will have solved scaling problems on applications with daily request volumes measured with an &quot;M&quot; and databases measured with a &quot;TB&quot;, or your spellbook is full of pandas incantations.
