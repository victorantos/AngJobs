Invisible - Remote (EST +&#x2F;- 6) - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.invisible.co&#x2F;technology-careers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.invisible.co&#x2F;technology-careers&#x2F;</a> Invisible builds a platform for Operations to run Business Processes. We stand at the intersection of humans and machines building scalable, repeatable processes for business using a combination of automation and human interaction. We&#x27;ve built an in house platform that handles the execution of these processes (think Zapier or IFFT that combines automations and human agents) and are solving interesting problems on teams ranging from Infra (Kubernetes, GCP) to UI (Python, Django, Typescript, React, Next.js). We&#x27;re currently hiring across multiple teams from Junior to Principle level and including Engineering Managers and Directors.
