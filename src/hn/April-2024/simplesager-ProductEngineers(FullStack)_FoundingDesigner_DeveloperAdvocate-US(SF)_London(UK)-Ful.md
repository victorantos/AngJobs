Hey there ! I&#x27;m Sagar, one of the co-founders at Speakeasy. We build tools to enhance the API developer experience. This primarily includes production-quality automatically-generated interfaces for companies&#x27; APIs such as SDKs and Terraform providers. Our mission is to assist teams in distributing their APIs to developers while handling the complex aspects.

We&#x27;re a small, highly autonomous team looking for contributors to drive major projects from inception through delivery and iteration, working closely with our customers and community. If you&#x27;re interested in developer-focused UX building with code generation, linters, parsers, LLMs you might find our work engaging. Although our primary languages are TypeScript and GoLang, our code gen product spans across more than eight languages â€” we&#x27;re truly polyglots! As we scale rapidly alongside our customers, we&#x27;re eager for individuals excited about delivering products that could impact millions of developers.
