Seshet Technologies is building an AI platform for accelerating reading and research and we are seeking a talented full-stack developer.

We use Vue3 on the front-end, and on the back-end we are looking for someone with python or ruby experience (we use both) with strong data structure and algorithms skills who feels comfortable with recursive and functional programming styles (AI skills a plus).
