Fondant | AI-powered 3D tools | Frontend Engineer&#x2F;Design Engineer | Full time, REMOTE

We are hiring for frontend engineer roles at Fondant. Design is the core of everything we do so if you are someone who is a frontend ninja with good taste in design, you will be a great fit.

You will be brainstorming, prototyping and rapidly implementing new interfaces for a 3D tool in the browser. A lot of your work will involve making the UX more intuitive for beginners yet effective for power users. WebGL experience and knowledge of 3D tools or game engines is a huge plus.

Reach out at my username [at] fondant.design with a short blurb about yourself and link(s) to a personal contribution(s) e.g., open-source code, designs, cool demo of something you built etc.

Fondant is on a mission to make 3D more accessible. We are building a tool that harnesses the latest advancements in generative AI&#x2F;ML to make new 3D workflows for modeling and rendering. Traditional 3D tools are often unapproachable (think Blender, 3DS Max). We are leveraging the lessons learnt from building traditional tooling over the last decade + SOTA work on 3D reconstruction, NeRFs, gaussian splatting and image generation.

We have an early product + users + funding.
