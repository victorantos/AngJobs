Virtual Store Trials | Full Stack Typescript Engineer | £70,000 - £110,000 per year + equity| London - UK | Hybrid (2&#x2F;3 days in the office) | No VISA sponsorship

We&#x27;re looking for a senior Typescript engineer to be part of a smart, caring and hard-working team changing the way giant brands like Mars, Coca Cola and Unilever work with giant retailers. It&#x27;s a startup: it&#x27;s unstructured, there&#x27;s a lot to do and we care about results (growth).

We’re a small, high-performance team who care about what we’re working on and each other. Your commercial colleagues are ready and excited to put the products we ship in front of huge international clients as well as relax and have some fun together to celebrate our achievements.
