Nordic Angels | Software Engineer | Full time | Remote &amp; Hybrid On-site | Stockholm &amp; Gothenburg, Sweden (role open to Nordic countries)

Nordic Angels emerged from the necessity of strengthening community, competence, and capital within the local startup ecosystems. We aim to unite angel investors and others involved in the Nordic startup scene, enhancing leverage and bandwidth across the community. Our platform facilitates powerful connections, insights, and efficiencies through events, deal flow sharing, matchmaking, and more, supporting the regionâ€™s position as a leader in innovation.

We&#x27;re looking for mid to senior level engineers to join our (intentionally) small team. Your focus will be on our main Elixir application (Ash, Phoenix and LiveView), so any experience with those or other BEAM languages in production is meriting.

We work remotely, but like to meet up every two weeks or so, therefore, applicants should be within a reasonable train distance from Stockholm or Gothenburg.

For further questions and applications, please contact me on chris at nordicangels.com
