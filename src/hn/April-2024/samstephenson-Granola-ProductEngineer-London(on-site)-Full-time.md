Granola | Product Engineer | London (on-site) | Full-time | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.granola.so" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.granola.so</a>

Want to build a beautiful, useful product with all the latest AI tooling?

At Granola we&#x27;re using LLMs to tackle a concrete user need: help people capture what matters during meetings and then quickly act on it after the meeting. We want Granola to feel as natural as picking up a pencil.

We raised $4 million last March from amazing investors. We’ve built startups before (Chris’ last company was acquired by Google) and we’re obsessed with building incredible, user-centric products. We&#x27;re inspired by folks like Douglas Engelbart and Alan Kay to build better tools for humans.

We like working in person, with nice people. We have a beautiful, light-filled workspace, and we’re looking for a Founding Engineer to build an amazing company with us.
