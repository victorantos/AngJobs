Great Question - Rails &#x2F; React Software Engineers - Full time, Remote (US Timezones)

Great Question is a unified customer research platform used and loved by teams at companies like Figma, Canva &amp; Brex. Our platform makes it easy for anyone to recruit research participants, schedule customer interviews, and share what you learn with your team all in one place.

We&#x27;re third-time founders, backed by Y Combinator, building a company for the long-term, with a great team across the board, and shipping at a rapid yet sustainable pace.

We use Ruby on Rails, React, Postgres. We run on AWS.

We&#x27;re looking for full-stack &amp; backend engineers (emphasis on Rails) with some product sensibilities who believe in the power of understanding your customers to build world class products.

We&#x27;ve built an awesome team + culture at the company, high candor + EQ environment and we ship. We also welcome applicants who have previously run their own startups, with a bunch ex-founders on the team from the likes of Respondent and Indiegogo.

I&#x27;m the co-founder &amp; CEO and actively playing a role in finding more great people to join the team: ned@greatquestion.co
