Resleeve | Intern Python Backend Engineer | REMOTE | Full-time internship | GMT +- 5h

Resleeve is a startup that seeks to transform how fashion designers develop their next fashion item and get a photoshoot from it. Instead of going through multiple drafts, creating a dummy, and hiring a photographer and model, all can now be achieved through Resleeve Studio. We were founded 18 months ago and pivoted last September.

Are you in your last year of university, or did you recently graduate? Do you 
want to gain hands-on experience building backend technology interfacing with generative AI? Then this could be a great opportunity. Our backend stack is Python, Next.js and we are now on our way to add some Go too. We developed a solid onboarding experience to ensure a great experience for you to grow and become a full-time employee over time!

We are looking for one to two backend engineers. We are a fully remote company that is well adapted to async ways of working. We have team members in US, Brazil, Egypt and various places in Europe.
