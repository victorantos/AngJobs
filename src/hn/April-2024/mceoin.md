Sourcetable is hiring a Senior&#x2F;Staff level product engineer (Python + React) to build a spreadsheet-based data platform.

We are an 10-person mostly-Bay Area team. We have some some remote folk, but this role is San Francisco based.

We have an Excel&#x2F;Sheets competitor coming to market, have raised a seed round, are an experienced team with prior success, plenty of hard engineering problems to solve, as well as a bunch of AI stuff cooking under the hood.

Culturally, we really like working with people who have been part of an early-stage startup. The majority of the team are ex-founders. It just seems to work better that way.

More info here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com&#x2F;jobs</a>
You can also email me (Eoin, founder) at sourcetable.com
Have a great day!
