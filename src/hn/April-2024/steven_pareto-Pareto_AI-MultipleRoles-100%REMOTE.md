Pareto.AI | Multiple Roles | 100% REMOTE | <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pareto.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pareto.ai</a>

Pareto.AI is in the premium data labeling space, focused on ethical, high-quality labeling. We are currently working with some the largest names in the AI space and growing rapidly.

We have a few full-time roles available:

1. General full stack web development (Python, Django, React) contributing to building our core labeling platform. We follow a scrumban approach with an essentially flat organization structure. Everyone is given lots of ownership, everyone helps run our rituals, and you&#x27;re able and encouraged to have inputs on everything we do.

2. A role suitable for &#x27;hackers&#x27; who enjoy working with mixtures of technologies on constant short and medium term (few weeks to a few months) projects for more custom labeling projects. In the last few weeks this has involved things like overlaying text over screen recordings with ffmpeg, SQL + Python scripts to clean and prepare data for annotation, building a Django dashboard that collates information from multiple sources, and so on. Almost all greenfield, requires coordinating with clients to interpret the project requirements, estimating the complexity and eventually choosing the right tools for the job and executing on the work. A truly &#x27;whiteboard to deployment&#x27; role where you get to have full ownership.

These are exclusively full time roles -- we can&#x27;t accept part time or fixed term contracts. All roles require a strong command of Python fundamentals. We are a fully remote, remote-first company with the engineering team spread around the US, South America, Africa and Europe. There is essentially no restriction on where you&#x27;re located as long as you&#x27;re able to be present for our core collaboration hours of 8am PST to 1pm PST.

No recruiting agencies or similar, we&#x27;re only interested in filling the open full-time roles.

Please mention me directly or HackerNews when applying to avoid getting caught up in the screening flow.
