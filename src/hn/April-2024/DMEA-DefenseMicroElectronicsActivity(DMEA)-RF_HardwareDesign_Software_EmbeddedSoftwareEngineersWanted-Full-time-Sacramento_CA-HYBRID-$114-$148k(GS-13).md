Defense MicroElectronics Activity (DMEA) | RF, Hardware Design, Software, Embedded Software Engineers Wanted | Full-time | Sacramento, CA | HYBRID | $114 - $148k (GS-13)

Who: A Department of Defense (DoD) field activity that has been operating since 1997. Small and engineer-centric. ~90% are engineer&#x2F;scientist.

What: Provide solutions to other US Government agencies and allies. Some tasks are engineering brand-new products and some tasks are re-engineering devices to keep legacy systems running. We do not compete with private industry but regularly work side-by-side with industry to get stuff done. We also have the only semiconductor foundry still operational within the federal government.

Why: US Government agencies sometimes want products built that are so technologically risky or low-volume that private industry does not want to do them. We fill the gap.

Where: Sacramento, CA -- California&#x27;s fourth largest metro area. Home to two major state universities (CSU-Sacramento and UC-Davis). The farm-to-fork, and regular, capital of California.

Benefits: We are federal employees and receive federal benefits (google &quot;opm benefits&quot; for more info). Time off starts at 36 days&#x2F;year (13 vacation + 13 sick + 10 federal holidays) and grows to 49 days&#x2F;year over time (26 + 13 + 10). We have flexible schedules and most of us work a &quot;9-to-5.” Hiring is for GS-13 engineers (google “gs pay scale 2024” and look at the Sacramento locality).

Tech Stack: Altium for Hardware design. Modern C&#x2F;C++(C++17) for embedded. C#&#x2F;.net for desktop application development and some server services. Python for scripting&#x2F;automation. Gitlab for SCM&#x2F;CI. We&#x27;re using modern tools to solve modern problems.

Interview: Must be a US citizen. Must be able to achieve and maintain a security clearance. 2 x Phone call [1 hr] &gt;&gt; Onsite w&#x2F;team [full day]
