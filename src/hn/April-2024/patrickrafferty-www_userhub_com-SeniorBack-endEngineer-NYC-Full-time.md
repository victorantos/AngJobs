www.userhub.com | Senior Back-end Engineer | NYC | Hybrid&#x2F;Onsite | Full-time

We are reimagining User Management &amp; Subscription Management as a User-Based Billing Platform to put modern monetization within reach of every software business.

We are a seed stage company looking to hire a back-end engineer.

- Go and spanner on backend, remix and react&#x2F;typescript on the front
- gRPC for our APIs
- google cloud and terraform

Would love to find someone who has banged their head on billing problems in the past - but not required.

Shoot me an email - patrick at userhub.com
