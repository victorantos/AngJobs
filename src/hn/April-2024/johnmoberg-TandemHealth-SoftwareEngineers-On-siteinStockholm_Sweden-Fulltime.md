Tandem Health | Software Engineers | On-site in Stockholm, Sweden | Full time

We’re using generative AI to automate medical documentation so that clinicians can spend more time with patients. Founded 8 months ago, we’re already live with dozens of clinics all over Sweden, growing rapidly (onboarded &gt;10 new clinics during the last month), and are now gearing up for expansion to new markets.

We’re a small team with an audacious mission - health care represents 10% of GDP and 30% is spent on administration, of which 43% can be automated. The impact will be huge. We believe that with our team’s strong understanding of the healthcare space in Europe and a fantastic engineering team, we will be the team that does it.

And until we can measure impact in terms of % of GDP, it’s already incredibly fulfilling to go to a care centre and meet clinicians that love our product. The impact is very real!

We’re currently looking for generalist engineers. Experience with health-tech, frontend, infrastructure, security, LLMs or ASR is especially meritorious.

If you think this sounds exciting, please reach out to me at john.moberg@tandemhealth.se and let’s explore a fit!
