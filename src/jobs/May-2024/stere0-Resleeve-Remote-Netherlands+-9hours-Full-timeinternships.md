Resleeve - Remote - Netherlands +- 9 hours - Full-time internships

Resleeve is a startup that seeks to transform how fashion designers develop their next fashion item and get a photoshoot from that item. Instead of going through multiple drafts, creating a dummy, hiring a photographer and model, all can now be achieved through Resleeve Studio. We were founded 1.5 year ago and pivoted in September.

If you are in your last year of university or recently graduated and you want to build some hands-on experience with generative models, then this could be a great internship experience.

We will provide you with an environment where you will work with the CEO and the CTO (me, ex-MLE leader at Bain &amp; Co and BCG deployed ML at big scale) to develop new features for our studio and work with our end-users to address their business needs. We also invest a lot of coaching and mentoring into our interns to help you become a full-time employee!
