We are looking for a software engineer to work in close collaboration with our tech lead. With your dev team colleagues and product design team you will build a B2B SaaS product defining an entire new product category within the space for sales software: giving complex B2B buying processes the look &amp; feel of simplicity.

We use TypeScript, NestJS, and React.

Interview process: initial video call, &quot;take-home&quot; exercise, follow up tech discussion, in-person meeting interview, and offer.

Valuecase is driven by our vision to build a software platform that redefines how millions of B2B sellers and buyers across the globe interact and close deals. We aspire to transform the B2B sales tech market as companies such as Salesforce and HubSpot have done so over the past 20 years.
