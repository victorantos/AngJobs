Rescale Supply -- Software Engineer -- REMOTE (USA only) -- Full-time -- ~$140k

The world of CPG and food manufacturing is both fascinating and complex. Today, when a new food brand starts to take off (think “startup” but for something like a hot sauce), they spend 12-18 months establishing a partnership with a manufacturer to produce their product at scale. The pain point is so high, they typically pay consultants $60k to solve the problem. Our cofounder (former Dir of Ops @ Trader Joes) did this as a consultant and now we are turning her expertise into software. We are building a mix of a marketplace + Turbotax style functionality to bring automation and scalability to the industry. With great traction and paying customers, we just closed a $2M seed round.

We are now ready and excited to bring on our first engineer. As part of an early-stage company, you’ll have real and tangible impact on the business and our users. Along with our CTO, you will write code and ship product to a growing number of paying customers. We prioritize a developer-friendly environment by being remote first, having low infrastructure&#x2F;configuration overhead, autonomy in your work, and getting rid of webpack. As with any startup, product requirements and direction can change. And we strive to always provide clarity around “what did we learn” + “how that changes our thinking”. We feel the added transparency and sense of ownership results in keeping us closer to our customers and delivers a better end product.
