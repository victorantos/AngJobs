Nightwatch.io - 100% Remote - Full-time &amp; Part-time Cultivating bootstrapped, non-corporate environment

We are the company famous for &quot;requesting&quot; a desktop screenshot when applying for a job, which earned us a lot of attention and criticism, even though the input field for the unimaginable sinful experiment was never a required one.

We are also known that we hire slow, especially since we look for a unique blend of multiple tech such as Rust, Go, Elixir (not necessarily exactly all in one), that caused some of the more suspicious members to think we are a recruiting agency looking for American talent to bring them to Europe. Which of course is not the case, and we deeply apologize to anyone who might find such slow and broad hiring offensive.

Another observation they will often do to derive certain assumptions that do not match the established way of &quot;silicon valley&quot; prescription is they will go on Linkedin to check for everyone who works for the company without knowing that there also exist people who don&#x27;t really take Linkedin seriously, and don&#x27;t have the need to update it in the first day they start working at Google.

Nevertheless, we appreciate the readers who undertake the efforts here and appreciate when people do something &quot;outside of the established book of prescription&quot;, so we would like to preserve this culture in our humble organization.

Nightwatch is helping companies understand their visibility on search engines and within LLM models.

We value freedom, autonomy, ownership, the attitude.
