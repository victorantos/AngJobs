Crusoe - Onsite&#x2F;Hybrid â€“ San Francisco - Climate Tech, Cloud Compute, Distributed Systems, Crypto - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crusoe.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crusoe.ai&#x2F;</a>

Crusoe is on a mission to align the future of computing with the future of the climate.

Data centers consume more than 2% of the world&#x27;s electricity.  We power data centers with stranded energy such as gas flares  and underloaded renewables , so for every GPU hour you use on Crusoe Cloud, you&#x27;re offsetting 0.5kg of CO2e, or approximately 4.4 metric tons over an entire year. The more compute you use, the more CO2 and other greenhouse gasses you offset.

Crusoe Cloud (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crusoe.ai&#x2F;cloud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crusoe.ai&#x2F;cloud</a>) offers the cleanest and lowest-cost GPU cloud computing solution in the world for workloads including graphical rendering, artificial intelligence research, machine learning, computational biology, therapeutic drug discovery, simulation and more.

Here&#x27;s a quick video so you can see what the systems look like in action, flames and everything: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rlt8k71Quqw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rlt8k71Quqw</a>
