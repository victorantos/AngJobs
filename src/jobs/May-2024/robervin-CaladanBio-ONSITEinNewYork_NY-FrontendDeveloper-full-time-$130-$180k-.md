Caladan Bio - ONSITE in New York, NY - Frontend Developer - full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caladan.bio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caladan.bio</a> - $130-$180k -

I&#x27;m Rob, cofounder &amp; cto at Caladan. We&#x27;re building 250ml modular bioreactors for synthetic biology scale-up. I&#x27;m looking for a frontend engineer to help build the application used to run the actual reactors. Heavy timeseries and analytic interfaces, experiment design, and visualization of bioengineering systems. Building with React &amp; TypeScript on the frontend, Django on the backend with a lot of other embedded systems in the mix.

Benefits, equity. We just closed a seed round and will be launching with customers later this year and early next year. Working from Brooklyn and would prefer someone who can come into the lab and get a bit of hands-on experience with the hardware while we&#x27;re building out the software.

Email a blurb and a resume to jobs@caladan.bio if you&#x27;re interested!
