Allows remote: Yes

We&#x27;re a 15-year old janitorial inspection software platform with local-first mobile apps.

We&#x27;re looking a senior developer to lead each of our iOS and Android app development efforts.

We&#x27;ve recently completed a proof of concept for a green android field app using fully native Kotlin &#x2F; jetpack tech to upgrade the user experience and potentially even overshoot the performance of our iOS app.

We&#x27;re also experimenting with an updated architecture on iOS that takes our user experience to the next level.
