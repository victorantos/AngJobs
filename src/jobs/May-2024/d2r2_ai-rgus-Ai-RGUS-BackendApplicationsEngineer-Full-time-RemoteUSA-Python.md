Ai-RGUS - Backend Applications Engineer - Full-time - Remote USA - Python

Ai-RGUS is artificial intelligence 100%-software solution that makes security camera system maintenance easy. Initially developed to manage Duke Universityâ€™s 2000+ camera system and now deployed in all 50 US states, Canada, and abroad, it automatically alerts of any problems, including cameras down&#x2F;unclear views, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities and automatically alerts the security team otherwise. We have an online user interface and API, making our software user-friendly and hassle-free.

We are looking for a Backend Applications Engineer to integrate our software with more security camera systems, help maintain our existing integrations, develop new functionality and expand the scope and functionality of our data collection and alerting engine for the large amounts of data we collect on a daily basis from security camera systems big and small.

We are looking for someone with 3+ years of industry experience with Python who can own the code they write, who is familiar with working on a team, code-reviews, and generally secure coding practices.
