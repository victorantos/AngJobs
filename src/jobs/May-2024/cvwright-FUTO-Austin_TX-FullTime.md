FUTO - Austin, TX - On-site &#x2F; Hybrid &#x2F; Remote - Full Time - iOS &#x2F; SwiftUI &#x2F; Javascript

FUTO is an organization dedicated to developing, both through in-house engineering and investment, technologies that frustrate centralization and industry consolidation. Through a combination of in-house engineering projects, targeted investments, generous grants, and multi-media public education efforts, we will free technology from the control of the few and recreate the spirit of freedom, innovation, and self-reliance that underpinned the American tech industry only a few decades ago.

We are hiring a Swift&#x2F;iOS software engineer to work on Circles, our end-to-end encrypted social network app for families and friends. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circles.futo.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circles.futo.org&#x2F;</a>
