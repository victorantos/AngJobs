BreezeRFP - Founding Engineer (Full Stack) - $175-250k + 1-3% Equity - Remote (US) or Hybrid (DC) - Full-Time

TL;DR
- We&#x27;re an AI startup democratizing access to government contracts by making it easier for small businesses to find and respond to soul-crushingly complex RFPs and paperwork.
- We just raised $3m (April 2024) and have strong GTM traction.
- We&#x27;re looking for a founding engineer to join our 4-person team. Long hours at the keyboard, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return unknown. Honor, recognition, and enormous riches in case of success.
