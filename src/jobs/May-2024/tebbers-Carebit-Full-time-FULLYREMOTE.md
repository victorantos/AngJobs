Carebit - Full-time - Full stack Rails &amp; React Product Engineer - FULLY REMOTE - £80k&#x2F;$100k equivalent

Carebit is a young, design-led healthcare technology company helping hundreds of private doctors across the UK run their practices more effectively and efficiently with our web platform, along with hundreds of thousands of their patients. For too long, medical software has been clunky, user-hostile and complicated, and we are changing that.

We are a bootstrapped, profitable and fully-remote company with an engineering team of 4. Having been remote from day 1, we believe in its benefits.

*About you*

You’ll consider yourself to be a senior level developer with solid technical ability and good communication, but what really sets you apart is your interest in product engineering (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;the-product-minded-engineer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;the-product-minded-engine...</a>).

Requirements:

* Proven ability to take a brief idea from a customer to a designed, shipped and tested feature that wows

* Ability to see the big picture when building a feature (e.g. how it can be made modular or flexible to accommodate changes in future, or where else could it be deployed in the Carebit application)

* 3+ years of React development &amp; 3+ years of Ruby on Rails development (We use Rails 7.1 and Ruby 3.3)

Benefits:

* Salary in the range of £80k&#x2F;$100k equivalent + annual bonus depending on experience and velocity

* Async work (minimal meetings)

* Fully remote within 4 hours of UTC (if UK based, we usually meet up in London every 2-3 months)

* MacBook Pro, ergonomic chair and anything else you need to do your best work

Please reach out to hiring AT carebit DOT co and introduce yourself with examples of products you have worked on - shipped or not!
