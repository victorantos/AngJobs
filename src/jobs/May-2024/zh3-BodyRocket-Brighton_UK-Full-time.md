Body Rocket -  Brighton, UK - Full-time

Got an interest in cycling, handy with linux, python, C, electronics and know your way around a circuit diagram? We&#x27;re a start-up that&#x27;s changing the game in cycling performance by precision measurement of cycling aerodynamics (check out who we&#x27;re working with, and our tech). You need to be UK-based, remote ok but need to spend some time with the team in Brighton and potentially where we&#x27;re doing overseas testing and events ($SUNNY_PLACES). Small enough to still be doing informal initial chats so feel free to engage and see if there&#x27;s a fit.
