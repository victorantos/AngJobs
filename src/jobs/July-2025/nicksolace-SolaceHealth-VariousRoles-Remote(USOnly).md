Solace Health - Various Roles - Remote (US Only)

A quick note. A few of you have pointed out we have been hiring for some of the same roles for a few months. This is true - it&#x27;s not because we have not hired anyone, quite the opposite. We are growing fast and our engineering team is no exception. I realize it&#x27;s hard to tell these days what jobs are &quot;real&quot; but make no mistake - we&#x27;re hiring aggressively.

About Solace:

The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken. When care gets delayed or denied, patients are often left with more questions than answers.

At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients &amp; improve outcomes. By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes.

Solace is a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast.
