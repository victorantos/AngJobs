Komodo Health - Applied AI Engineer - Full-Time - $200-$250k + equity... - SF On-site &#x2F; Remote US

Healthcare in the U.S. is a mess. Komodo Health is fixing that—with data. We’ve mapped the patient journey across the country to build the most complete picture of disease burden and treatment gaps. Our customers are pharma, payers, and health systems who actually want to do something meaningful with that information.

We have exciting products that are AI-native, both in the interface as well as in development, and want to carefully grow high productivity teams. AI integrated with Komodo&#x27;s data is giving some of the most unique, real world insights any of us has seen come out of the new LLM era. I can assure you it will blow your mind, and it will be one of the most rewarding AI products you can be working on now!

We are looking for highly independent individuals, who can work in a new, small, but empowered team to create our AI product. What will you be bringing? 
 - Proven experience working on Agentic systems that solve real problems
 - Some evidence you have the &quot;instinct&quot; Andrew Ng mentions as the differentiators of successful Agent builders 
 - Fully comfortable developing in an AI-first, almost AI-exclusive development paradigm (happy to discuss what that means)

I&#x27;ve been on HN for years and always wished I had a post that was cool enough to post here, and finally excited that I do have one here. If this post sounds exciting, Please email me at ramraj.velmurugan@komodohealth.com and we can start a discussion!
