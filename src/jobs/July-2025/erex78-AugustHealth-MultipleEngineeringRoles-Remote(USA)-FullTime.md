August Health - Multiple Engineering Roles - Remote (USA) - Full Time

Our mission is to empower the essential work of caring for our elders. We achieve this by providing a modern operating platform and electronic health record that enables senior living operators to deliver high-quality care with confidence.

Caregivers are the heart of senior living communities, embodying care, compassion, and well-being. Yet, they face increasing challenges—higher resident acuity, complex workflows, and staffing shortages. At August Health, we build tools that simplify their tasks, eliminate inefficiencies, and provide the insights they need to focus on what truly matters—caring for residents.

Our team brings together deep expertise in technology, healthcare, and company-building. We’ve led teams at Apple, Google, Landmark Health, and Adobe, co-founded and exited multiple companies, shipped products used by hundreds of millions of users, and managed clinical teams caring for thousands of patients.

Backed by top-tier Silicon Valley investors, we are partnering with some of the largest senior care organizations in the U.S. to transform the future of senior living. Our team is ~50 employees today.
