Prophet Town LLC - Full-Stack Software Engineer; also, Sales and Marketing - REMOTE (US) and Hybrid - English fluency required - Full-time - $150K-$250K annual total comp (multiple)

I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a small, worker-first, fully-remote, SF-based, boutique indie tech agency. Our leadership staff are ex-Fortune 100; everybody codes. Notable recent projects: internal tools for Anduril, and voltagepark.com.

Applicants must meet a high bar; in return, I pledge my personal commitment to finding you interesting work and getting you good pay. You are free to submit again even if you have already done so in the past.

Engineers:

We are looking for Full-Stack Software Engineers with proficiency in React development, database design, devops, and third-party API integration. Tier3 roles are typically 5-10 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e with $150-$175k annual total comp. Tier4 roles are 7-20 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e, $210-$250k annual total comp. Higher tiers exist, and we welcome exceptional applications. Fully remote positions available.

Please apply using this Google Form: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;VQ7zEkNkzBZ4Wbas8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;VQ7zEkNkzBZ4Wbas8</a>.  Applicants who submit before July 11 will receive a reply by July 18.

Sales and Marketing:

(seriously, engineers, please stop submitting here.  you want the google form up above.  If you email for the sales role, you&#x27;ll get misprocessed and denied.)

Prophet Town is mostly engineers and TPMs; we’re lightweight on business majors :).  I’ve done most of the sales for the company personally as the Founder.  I am trying something new, and issuing a general RFP for folks interested in joining a nascent sales and marketing arm within Prophet Town.  Learn our ~50 hire-out staff, and our recent projects, and help land the next million dollar build-an-app or staffing-gig contract, that provides slam dunk matches between Work and Workers.  I do not believe in cold-calling or spamming. Also, please note that I am personally ex-Google, and helped run Adwords: I believe in science and data-driven sales and marketing, and want humble and academic bizdevs who postulate falsifiable hypotheses and minimize time and spend to prove hunches wrong (and expect to be wrong a lot!).  Please send me a pitch, resume (pdf, attachment), and your preferred pay band and&#x2F;or comp strategy, to hn-sales-rfp@ptown.tech.  For emails sent by July 15, I will personally review emails, and respond before July 25.
