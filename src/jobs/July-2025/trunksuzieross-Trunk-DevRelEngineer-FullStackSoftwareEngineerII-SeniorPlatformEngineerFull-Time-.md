Trunk is an a16z funded dev tools startup, redefining software development at scale. We aim to solve problems that developers hate by bringing the tools usually built in-house at the best engineering orgs to every development team. We&#x27;ve built 4 products so far and have plans for more:

<pre><code>  * Code Quality: a universal linter&#x2F;formatter, available as a CLI, VSCode extension, and CI check;

  * Merge Queue: a merge queue, to ensure that PRs are tested in order before they&#x27;re merged; and

  * CI Analytics: detects, quarantines, and eliminates flaky tests from your code base. Prevents flakey tests from producing noise and blocking CI.

  *Flaky Tests: Detect and eliminate Flaky Tests.</code></pre>
In 2022, we raised a $25M Series A led by Initialized Capital (Garry Tan) and a16z (Peter Levine)
Our tech stack:

<pre><code>  * Frontend: Typescript, React, Redux, Next.js
  * Backend: Typescript, Node, AWS, CDK, k8s, gRPC

  * CLI: C++20, Bazel
