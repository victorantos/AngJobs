Touchpoint - Senior Typescript&#x2F;PHP - Full-time - Remote USA

Touchpoint is transforming the restaurant industry for brands, staff, and guests.

Unlike the bloated, integration-heavy systems from legacy providers, Touchpoint delivers a unified platform that adds value at every interaction. Built natively into our ecosystem are:

- In-store POS&#x2F;KDS&#x2F;CFD&#x2F;Kiosk

- A cross-platform mobile ordering app and website

- Gift card and payment processing

- The most successful loyalty system in the industry

- Direct marketing tools

- Data analytics and business intelligence

Our stack:

- Backend: Mostly PHP on FreeBSD, with some ETL&#x2F;backend systems containerized on Linux

- Frontend: TypeScript + Vue&#x2F;Quasar, deployed cross-platform

- Data &amp; Cloud: ClickHouse, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS&#x2F;SQS, deployed via SST and CDK

Weâ€™re looking for pragmatic, detail-oriented developers excited to build and refine a modern, growing platform. Our small team structure means your work will have real, immediate impact. We&#x27;re especially interested in people who can ramp up quickly and start shipping meaningful improvements without a long onboarding runway.
