360Me - Founding CTO &amp; iOS Engineer - London &#x2F; UK - Full-time - AI, Precision Health, Aging

We&#x27;re building 360Me: an AI-driven platform that helps people measure and reverse their biological age using diagnostics, wearables, and real-time insights. Backed by clinical validation and a world-class product team, we&#x27;re turning fragmented health data into personalized, impactful action.

We’re hiring a Founding CTO to lead and scale our technical foundations — and an experienced iOS Engineer to help deliver a seamless mobile experience from day one.

Founding CTO (AI, Infra, Health)
You’ll architect, build, and scale the entire tech stack from 0→1, then grow the team around what works. You’ll ship our food analysis API (image&#x2F;audio&#x2F;text → nutrient vector), build real-time infra with GCP&#x2F;Vertex AI&#x2F;Terraform, and lead engineering through our first clinical pilot. You’ll own core technical decisions, contribute code, and eventually hire and mentor a high-performing team.

You Likely Have:
    10+ yrs engineering experience, 5+ in AI&#x2F;ML or data-intensive systems •
    Proven 0→1 track record (healthtech, biotech, or regulated SaaS ideal) •
    Comfortable writing production code and scaling systems •
    PhD&#x2F;DPhil or deep experience in CS, AI, Physics, or Computational Bio (bonus)

$160k–$200k + equity
