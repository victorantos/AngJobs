We&#x27;re building a new kind of personal computer in the cloud, designed from first-principles for an AI named Zo that &quot;lives&quot; on your machine. You can write, do research, schedule tasks, run code, host sites and services, and much more, all from your Zo computer.

Our cofounders are Ben (early at Stripe 2015-2023) + Rob (first eng at Substack).

Looking for experienced, high-taste, high-agency generalist software engineers to form the founding team.
