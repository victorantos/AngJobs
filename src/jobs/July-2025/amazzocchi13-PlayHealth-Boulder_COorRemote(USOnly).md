Play Health - Founding Designer&#x2F;Design Engineer - Boulder, CO or Remote (US Only)

Play Health is redefining care for women in perimenopause through a precision platform that combines at-home hormone testing, real-time symptom tracking, and AI-powered insights. Our system translates complex biological and behavioral data into clear, personalized guidance - helping women understand what’s happening in their bodies and what actually works to feel better. As our user base grows, so does a uniquely structured, longitudinal dataset, creating a flywheel that powers better interventions today and unlocks discovery opportunities for women’s midlife health and longevity tomorrow.

We’re previously funded, experienced founders with deep expertise in biotech, clinical data, systems-level biology, and engineering - now looking for a founding designer: a world-class product designer or design engineer ready to own the entire product experience and help shape the future of women’s health.
