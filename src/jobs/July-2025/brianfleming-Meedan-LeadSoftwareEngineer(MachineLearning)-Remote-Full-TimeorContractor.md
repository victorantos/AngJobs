Meedan - Lead Software Engineer (Machine Learning) - Remote - Full-Time or Contractor - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meedan.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meedan.com</a>

Meedan is a global nonprofit focused on building open source digital tools and community-led programs that enhance the accessibility, reliability, and distribution of information - when and where people need it most. We also strive to make online ecosystems safer, more inclusive, and more equitable, so that existing pathways for content production and distribution can better serve the needs of all communities, regardless of their location, language, or income.

About the Role:

You’ll be responsible for leading the design and development of a Python-based backend service integrating AI&#x2F;ML models and structured data systems. The role will require you to design scalable APIs, data ingestion pipelines, and real-time query services that serve AI-powered features across our platform. You will operate with significant autonomy, define the technical architecture, and deliver production-ready systems.

What We’re Looking For:

- 8+ years of professional software engineering experience.

- Strong track record of independently designing and delivering complex backend systems.

- Deep expertise in Python, particularly for backend API services and AI&#x2F;ML integration.

- Hands-on experience with FastAPI (or comparable modern Python web frameworks).

- Experience integrating AI&#x2F;ML models into production systems (LLMs, transformers, fine-tuning, etc.).

- Strong system design, data modeling, and architectural thinking.

- Familiarity with scalable ingestion pipelines, asynchronous processing, and event-driven architectures.

- Experience with cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS), CI&#x2F;CD pipelines, monitoring, and observability.

- Nice to have: Experience with knowledge graphs or graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).
