Galaxy (getgalaxy.io) - Cursor for Data - NYC, NY - Full time -- Founding Frontend Engineer -- Founding Machine Learning Engineer
We are building the unified data platform, starting with a reimagined, modern, AI-enabled SQL editor - and will move into sharing, collaboration, access controls, and more.

We launched the alpha 3 weeks ago to 100 people on our 2K waitlist (and growing) and the feedback was INCREDIBLE. There is massive pull for this product and NOW is the time to build this :)

Mitch Bregman (linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;mitchbregs), me (Garrett Wolfe - linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;garrettawolfe) and one friend (TBA) started Galaxy as a passion project to solve 3 key problems:

1. *Queries everywhere* – SQL lives in Slack snippets, BI folders, dusty Git repos, and copy-pasted Notion pages.

2. *Never-ending data requests* – because no one can find (or trust) the right query, engineers and analytics teams still get pinged for “one more pull.”

3. ChatGPT doesn’t have full DB context - non technical users are writing incorrect SQL that lacks context AND technical users are rewriting the same queries over and over again

LOOKING FOR: We&#x27;re looking for high agency, high velocity individuals and someone who wants to be part of a family. We are building ~the unified data platform~ and want someone who is excited to be part of the story.
