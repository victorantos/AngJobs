Locket is building the platform that puts real friends first. Since launching in 2022, Locket has grown to 10s of millions of active users and is one of the fastest-growing apps amongst Gen Z around the world.

We&#x27;re looking for talented engineers to continue scaling the Locket backend. When Locket launched three years ago, we scaled from 20 beta testers to 1M+ sign ups in a few weeks time. If scaling this fast sounds exciting, we want to work with you.

As one of our first ten engineers, you&#x27;ll be able to touch all parts of the stack, have the opportunity to ship to millions of daily users from day one, and be given ownership over large parts of the product.

Some of the backend challenges we have today include:

- Optimizing performance, reliability, and costs of our micro-services infra, which serves 1B+ requests per day.

- Designing AI data pipelines to process billions of data points.

- Designing a next-generation backend architecture that will support our growth for the years to come.

Our tech stack is built on NodeJS and Typescript along with a wide variety of GCP products including Firebase, Firestore, Bigtable, Bigquery, Redis, Cloud Run, Vertex AI.

We care more about what you&#x27;ve done than your resume, so tell us the thing you&#x27;ve built that you&#x27;re most proud of.

- 3+ Years of Relevant Experience: We are looking for a range of skill levels as we value execution, creativity and passion.
