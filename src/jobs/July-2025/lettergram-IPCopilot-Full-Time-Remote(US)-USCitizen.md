IP Copilot is an AI platform that discovers patentable innovations in real time and streamlines the patent process for enterprises, universities, and law firms. Fresh off a September 2024 seed round, our nine-person, fully-remote team (ex-researchers with 1,000+ patents and multiple enterprise launches) is hiring a back-end engineer to own integrations into our Python&#x2F;Ruby API and third-party services, harden our AWS&#x2F;PostgreSQL infrastructure, and ship features that automate patent workflows. You’ll collaborate with ML, design, and business teammates, meet power users, set the roadmap, and build thoroughly tested, monitored services—all while wearing the many hats that come with an early-stage startup.

Perks: excellent health&#x2F;dental&#x2F;mental-health coverage, equity, competitive salary, unlimited vacation, mentorship, and real ownership.
