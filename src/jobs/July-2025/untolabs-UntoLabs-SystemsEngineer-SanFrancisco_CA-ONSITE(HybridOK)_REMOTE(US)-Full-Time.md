Unto Labs - Systems Engineer - San Francisco, CA - ONSITE (Hybrid OK), REMOTE (US) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;unto-labs&#x2F;13df6bea-b253-4c80-ae05-5899022c3471" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;unto-labs&#x2F;13df6bea-b253-4c80-ae05-5...</a>

We recently announced $14.4 million in funding to make blockchains &amp; digital assets useful for the world. Founded by Jump Crypto alumni and core contributors to the Solana protocol and the Firedancer client (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;firedancer-io&#x2F;firedancer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;firedancer-io&#x2F;firedancer</a>), we’re tackling fundamental scalability, performance, and usability challenges in distributed ledgers. Our runtime conforms to the RISC-V specification—moving away from domain-specific VMs, DSLs, and bespoke compiler toolchains that limit developer and institutional adoption. Components are developed in C for maximal control over performance and resource usage.

Interesting problems you’ll tackle:

- Building and testing high-performance subsystems in C (cryptographic routines, consensus primitives, networking protocols)

- Designing robust process isolation on modern CPU architectures and tile-based multi-core layouts

- Optimizing memory hierarchies, cache utilization, and low-level I&#x2F;O for commodity servers

You:

- 5+ years of systems programming in C&#x2F;C++, Rust, or similar

- Deep expertise in CPU microarchitecture, memory subsystems, and low-level performance tuning

- Strong understanding of distributed systems design and consensus protocols

- Experience with high-performance networking and protocol design in real-time environments
