Continue - ONSITE - San Francisco - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;continue.dev">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;continue.dev</a>

Continue is building an open-source AI code assistant along with a hub of models, rules, and tools. Our VS Code and JetBrains extensions are primarily written in TypeScript, but we write small amounts of Kotlin (for JetBrains), Rust (for performant codebase indexing), and Go (for easy distribution of a CLI).

We&#x27;re hiring for junior, mid-level, and senior full-stack software engineers.
