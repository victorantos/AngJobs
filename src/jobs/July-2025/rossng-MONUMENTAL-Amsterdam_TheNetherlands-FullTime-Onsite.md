MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite

Weâ€™re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.

Building a robot like this means solving all sorts of interesting challenges: figuring out the robot&#x27;s position with sub-mm precision; navigating autonomously around the building site; automating measurement and calibration of new robots; lots of distributed systems and so on.

Our robots are now continuously deployed on customer sites and we are earning real money as a masonry contractor. The full team is more than 60 people and we&#x27;re growing rapidly to meet demand.

Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.

Some open roles:

- Software Engineer, Full Stack

- Software Engineer, Controls

- Software Engineer, Machine Vision

- Assembly&#x2F;manufacturing technicians and robot operators

P.S. When we say full stack, we really mean it. Bolting things together, mixing mortar, embedded firmware, (software) build systems, React components and everything in between. Happy to answer questions.
