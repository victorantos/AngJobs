Standard Model - Research Scientist (Foundation Models writ large) - Remote, Philadelphia - Full-time

We&#x27;re building the standard model for biomedicine. Starting with the foundation model for oncology patients. If you want to build multimodal foundation models over genomes, CT scans, pathology slides, or electrophysiological signals, this is us. We are a small team, and would like to stay &lt;10 until 100M ARR.

No medical experience necessary (we value it highly, but recruit it from elsewhere).
