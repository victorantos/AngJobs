NexusGrid builds software to help energy generators stay compliant, secure, and audit-ready.

We&#x27;re tackling the growing complexity of US energy regulations by automating data validation, documentation, and reporting — turning what&#x27;s now a painful, manual process into a seamless, secure platform. With a power engineering talent shortage compounding the problem, operators desperately need automation. We&#x27;re driven by $1.7T energy transition investment, where new regulatory requirements create natural competitive moats and mandatory adoption.

By leveraging AI to detect anomalies and flag compliance risks early, we help operators move from reactive to proactive, so they’re always ahead of the curve.

As a founding engineer, you’ll shape the technical core of our platform — from building secure cloud pipelines and encryption frameworks to architecting time-series data storage and intuitive compliance dashboards. You’ll work closely with our team (a CFA with a decade in capital markets and a PhD EE from the power sector) to solve problems that sit at the heart of energy reliability and grid stability.

Founding Data &#x2F; Full Stack Engineer:

• Cloud infrastructure (AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure), VPC &amp; secure data pipelines
• IaC (Terraform &#x2F; CloudFormation)
• Encryption, IAM, audit logging
• Handling batch + real-time ingestion (Kafka, NiFi, serverless)
• Building the foundation for ML models that spot compliance gaps before they become audit findings

Meaningful equity, full product&#x2F;technical ownership, remote friendly (US preferred). Contact us: jeanne@nexusgrid.ai
