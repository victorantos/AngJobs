Vision Intelligence - Senior Engineer – Infra, Tooling, and Backend - Western Sydney, Australia - Hybrid - Full-time

Cool stuff: We work on offline-first systems, distributed state, real-time video streaming, and remote edge device management. We get to work on finding practical solutions to hard problems in software and hardware.

Company: Vision Intelligence is a 10-year-old IoT company building solar-powered site-security and monitoring systems, operating across Australia and New Zealand. We’re vertically integrated — from hardware manufacturing and logistics, to 24&#x2F;7 monitoring and software development. We’re growing fast and investing heavily in new software platforms to support our expanding fleet. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visioni.com.au" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visioni.com.au</a>

Role: We’re spinning up a new internal team to build the platform that powers how our customers manage field-deployed devices across their sites. You’d be the third engineer — helping shape both the infrastructure and engineering culture from the ground up. We’re looking for someone comfortable in a backend&#x2F;devops role and is happy to wear a few hats across backend, infra, ops, and tooling. This is a hands-on role where you’ll work directly with experienced engineers across the organisation.

Experience: We’re after a senior engineer who can piece together systems on AWS and codify everything using the CDK. You should be comfortable building cloud-native applications, enjoy debugging things in production, and be eager to contribute application-level code as well — whether it’s shaping backend services, improving developer tooling, or building integrations between systems.

Technologies: TypeScript&#x2F;Node.js, AWS, IaC (CDK, or similar), CI&#x2F;CD, React.

Location: Hybrid in Seven Hills, Western Sydney, Australia. During the first month, we’ll be in-office 3 days&#x2F;week to get up to speed together. After that, 1–2 days&#x2F;week is the norm.

Salary: $160k–180k AUD + super.

Working rights: you must have full-time working rights in Australia.
