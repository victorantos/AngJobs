New Public (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newpublic.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newpublic.org</a>) - Senior+ Software Engineer - REMOTE (US, Canada) - Full-time - 160-175k

We are working with a consortium of public broadcasters around the world to create a publicly-owned public-interest online space that helps people with different viewpoints understand each other and relate to each other. This project has a lot of momentum behind it, particularly as recent political changes in the US are getting countries interested in the idea of digital sovereignty.

Our partners have a combined regular audience that collectively includes a substantial fraction of the western world, so if we get the product to a good enough state that they can promote it aggressively, it has the potential to be one of the biggest and most important platforms in the world.

The New Public dev team currently consists of me, Rob Ennals (ex Google, Meta, Quora), Blaine Cook (created Twitter), and Daniel Bachhuber (ran Wordpress.com), so it&#x27;s a fun team to be on. We also have very strong experienced Designers and PMs.

Particularly interested in people with experience working on social products, experience being a core developer of a large product with lots of external contributors, or a deep interest in helping people with different viewpoints relate to each other.
