Friendly Captcha - Data Engineer - Bot Protection - REMOTE within EU - PART-TIME or FULL-TIME - Office in Munich, Germany - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;friendlycaptcha.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;friendlycaptcha.com</a>

At Friendly Captcha we do one thing and we do it well: we protect websites from malicious actors and bots.

We provide privacy-friendly and accessible anti-bot solutions that don’t annoy users with tasks like clicking fire hydrants. We make the internet a bit better every day by winning over customers currently using Google reCAPTCHA.

We’re a growing, profitable, fully bootstrapped company. Our revenue mostly comes from medium to large European enterprise and governments.

We’re looking for an engineer whose focus will be on using data to improve our bot detection and protection. Telling apart bots from genuine users is vital to our product.

If possible, we prefer to keep things simple (perhaps boring is the right word even?) - choosing an if&#x2F;else rule over a neural network. Good knowledge of the web is always useful in this company. At our scale we are looking for generalists more than specialists.

Our engineering team is fully remote across Europe, we meet up in person a few times per year. You can work either 4 or 5 days per week, fully remote or (partially) from our Munich office. Please note that we ONLY consider candidates located within the EU&#x2F;UK&#x2F;EEA&#x2F;Switzerland.

Stack: Golang - Typescript - Clickhouse - Postgres - Redis - Python data science stack
