Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma.tech. Previously worked  as software engineer &amp; developer advocate at Cloudant (YC S08, Acq. by IBM), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11, Facebook&#x2F;Meta), and explored Ai&#x2F;ML (computer vision for self-driving cars).

We have 2 main products:

1. Puma Browser with built in LLMs &amp; Wallets. Private by design.
Future of the web is agentic – come help us explore best ways to shape it.

2. Puma Network that we&#x27;re just starting to build out – a way to store and share your memories, context and credentials and provide access to other apps.

If either is exciting to you – please reach out.
