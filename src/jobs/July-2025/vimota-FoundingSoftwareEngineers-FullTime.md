CoPlane (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coplane.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coplane.com&#x2F;</a>) - Founding Software Engineers - Remote (US&#x2F;CAN Timezones) - Full Time

The world doesn&#x27;t need another ERP. CoPlane is building the Agentic Orchestration platform that enables enterprises to orchestrate intelligent processes across their existing systems. Founded by ex-Stripe&#x2F;Segment product and tech leads, we&#x27;re changing how businesses operate their backoffice - helping them scale intelligence not headcount.

We&#x27;re looking for exceptional engineers to grow our small founding team of engineers that include ex-founders, open source contributors (authors of neverthrow and neovim), and architects of petabyte-scale data platforms. You&#x27;ll work with billion-dollar enterprises solving their hardest, most mission-critical automation problems.

If you&#x27;re excited about working at the nexus of data, finance and AI, and want to make a significant impact in an early, well-capitalized startup with large enterprise design partners, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.

Roles: Platform Engineer, Product Engineer and Forward Deployed AI Engineer.
