Max AI - SWE Fullstack, Backend, AI&#x2F;ML Engineer - Hybrid In-Person (SF) - Full-time - $145k — $230k - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maxcare.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maxcare.ai</a>

Max AI is building the financial operating system for healthcare—turning the broken, error-prone billing process into a lightning-fast, autonomous experience, much like swiping a credit card. Our ambient AI agents handle medical coding, claim submission, and fund collection the moment a doctor finishes charting—no humans in the loop.

We’re addressing a $350 billion market where billing errors cause delayed treatments, higher healthcare costs, and massive medical debt. By eliminating billing mistakes, we enable faster access to care, reduce administrative burden on doctors, and protect patients from surprise bills.

Team:

- PhD&#x2F;Postdoc AI scientists from MIT and Caltech

- Ex-VP of Engineering at Curative (led engineering for over 25M medical claims billed)

- Founders who’ve scaled products to 40M+ downloads and 150M+ monthly users

- A team of experienced engineers from Discord, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Brex, and Figma
