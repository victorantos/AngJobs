At Konvu, we’re on a mission to make security invisible. As we move towards a future dominated by code automatically generated, tested, and deployed by AIs, we need a new paradigm for application security. We need vulnerabilities to be automatically detected, prioritized and remediated.

Behind Konvu are founders with deep roots in the security industry. As part of the founding team at Sqreen (YC W18), a notable security startup acquired by Datadog, we have firsthand experience in driving security solutions from concept to global impact.

We’re looking for:
