Sourcetable.com - Product Marketing (contract) - San Francisco

We&#x27;re building a spreadsheet-based operating system for the web, although on first touch Sourcetable feels more like Excel Copilot or &quot;Cursor for spreadsheets&quot;.

We&#x27;re looking for one Product Marketer to join our team in a part-time contract capacity in San Francisco. The requirement are that you need to be great at video storytelling and also be strong at spreadsheets &amp; analysis.

Everyone on our team codes, and you should too. There&#x27;s no technical requirement for the role, per-se, but we have found it is better this way.

Email me if this sounds interesting.
