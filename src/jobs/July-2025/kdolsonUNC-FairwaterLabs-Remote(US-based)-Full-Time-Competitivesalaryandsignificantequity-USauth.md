Fairwater Labs - Founding Engineer &#x2F; Technical Product Co-Founder for AI content generation Dual-Use Startup focused on workforce attention and engagement - Remote (US-based) - Full-Time - Competitive salary and significant equity - US authorized only

Help us reinvent how US + partner military and civilian teams leverage AI to maximize attention and engagement onto the most important and evolving needs. We’re building an AI copilot that enables leaders to move away from sending emails that go unread, and towards more engaging, habit-forming, and micro &#x2F; repetitive content means to emphasize most essential priorities, and align workforces dealing with high-risk environments, disruption, and transformation.

Why join now?
Backing from a dual‑use venture studio with multiple exits and in‑house DoD BD expertise.

Validated user stories, early wireframes, and early potential users are ready—your code ships to real operators fast.

Co-Founder CEO, with background in driving go-to-market, is still in the process of being sourced and recruited, so you would be a part of that process of early company and founding team formation.

What you’ll do
Own the end-to-end architecture &amp; tech &#x2F; product roadmap – choose the stack, design data pipelines, secure cloud infra, and front-end.

Iterate on prototypes right away with the Fairwater Labs team, and join in the next phase of customer discovery.

Then, when the GtM Co-founder is in place, work together (and with Fairwater team support) to build the MVP, ship weekly releases, then hire and lead a small, AI-leveraged team.

Co-shape product decisions with DoD users and early commercial adopters.

You
Highly experienced full-stack&#x2F;ML&#x2F;AI engineer who can explain and defend tool choices (e.g. Python, TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript, React, LangChain, vector DBs, CI&#x2F;CD, IaC).

Proven track record shipping production LLM &#x2F; AI tools for content generation, and&#x2F;or mobile applications that get to high-frequency use (daily, habit-forming)
Comfortable with DevSecOps and data security (familiarity with GovCloud&#x2F;IL4+ a plus).

Entrepreneur at heart—show us something you’ve built that shipped fast.
Send a brief intro (or resume if you have it) + GitHub&#x2F;portfolio to jeff@fairwaterlabs.com.
