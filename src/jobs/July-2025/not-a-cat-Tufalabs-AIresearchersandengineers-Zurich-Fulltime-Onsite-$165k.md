Tufalabs - AI researchers and engineers - Zurich - Full time - Onsite - $165k - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tufalabs.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tufalabs.ai&#x2F;</a>

We are a small, independent research group working on fundamental AI research.

Since around 2008, I always believed that AI research will be the most impactful technology to work on, both from an intellectual curiosity and technological capability perspective. After a few failed attempts to get into ML&#x2F;AI research, I decided to apply it to quant finance, and then start an AI research lab from it.

This is how Tufalabs was funded about a year ago. We started working on ARC (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcprize.org&#x2F;arc-agi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcprize.org&#x2F;arc-agi</a>), and since o3 we focus on LLM-based reasoning, self-improving loops and scaling trends. You can see some of our research there: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tufalabs.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;_site&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tufalabs.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;_site&#x2F;</a>

We do not have too many spots left, but I want to make sure we don&#x27;t miss-out on people who would be great fits. We look for obsessive people who share the same research interests.
