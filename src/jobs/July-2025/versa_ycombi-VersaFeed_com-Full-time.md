VersaFeed.com - SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER (Python&#x2F;Django) - REMOTE (USA&#x2F;EU) - Full-time

*About us*: Fancy ETL pipeline which processes products from huge ecommerce companies. Data extraction and massage, delivery to destinations like Google&#x2F;Meta&#x2F;TikTok&#x2F;etc. Profitable, 15+ yrs stable, 100% employee-owned. No VC, no pointless meetings, just serious coding.

*Stack*: Python&#x2F;Django, JavaScript, VueJS, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Docker, Git, AWS, AI&#x2F;LLM integrations (OpenAI &amp; Gemini).

*Compensation*: $150K–$250K USD&#x2F;year DOE.

*You*: Senior dev who&#x27;s seen (and fixed) enough dumpster-fire code to last a lifetime. Python&#x2F;Django deeply internalized; ideally Vue (or React) skills as well. Git&#x2F;Docker&#x2F;REST are second nature. You’re the coder other devs come to when their stuff breaks: an architect-level thinker who’s rewritten ‘clever’ code into something that actually works. You play well with others and write code that’s easy to live with. Bonus: AI integrations, Py2→Py3 migrations, Snowflake (or Databricks) experience.

*Timezones*: Primary time zone is PST (some standups at 9AM PST). Otherwise async-friendly.

*Benefits*: 401K match (USA), healthcare, equity, fully remote. Stable company with no time-wasters.
