We are Lightdash, an open source BI and analytics dashboard. We have recently closed our series A and are actively hiring for senior full-stack engineers with experience in Typescript+React+Node+SQL. Bonus points for experience in data-related companies&#x2F;projects, or being a founding engineer at a startup.

We are a remote-first company, with our team members currently distributed all over Europe.

We are hiring for two roles: product engineer and customer engineer. The requirements are basically the same, but the latter requires a bit more customer interaction. You can find all the details and apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;lightdash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;lightdash</a>

Important considerations:

- cover letter is very important, and please do not use chatgpt to write it (we have automated checkers in place)

- please mention on the referral field that you come from HN!

- this is a fulltime, permanent position, so we’re not considering contractors&#x2F;consultants.

- we are also not considering people outside of european timezones
