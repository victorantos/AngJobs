Around - Lead Backend Developer - Full-time - Remote

We’re building a modern platform to transform how companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry operate and grow. Our goal is to streamline the way products are presented, shared, and sold across global markets. We’re post-MVP and pre-revenue, now moving fast to onboard early users and shape the future of this industry.

We’re looking for a Lead Backend Developer to join our ambitious, early-stage startup as a foundational team member. If you’re excited by the idea of taking the lead on the ongoing development and strategy for our backend architecture, making high-level technical decisions, and getting in at the ground floor of something big — we want to talk.
