Zetier - Multiple US locations (VA, PA, FL, TX, CA, NY) - ONSITE - Full-Time

Zetier develops real-world tools and capabilities to secure our nation in the short- and long-term. If you’re excited to delve deep into low-level systems, exploit dev, and more alongside a group of passionate hackers, then we’d love to hear from you.

Open-sourcing our work as much as possible is integral to Zetier and what we stand for. As folks who learned to hack on platforms like Linux, we aim to give back to the OSS community. Not only do we encourage our engineers to contribute, but we go a step further, adding monetary incentives to do so.

We’re looking to find the right people for a range of roles, including:

+ Vulnerability Researcher

+ Android Security Engineer

+ CNO Embedded Engineer

+ CNO Software Engineer

+ IT Security Engineer

+ Information Systems Security Manager

+ Senior Technical Lead
