Moonchild - Software Engineer - AI-Native Startup - Remote (US only)

We&#x27;re building the future of product design in this new AI world. We&#x27;re early stage, fast-moving, and building something that matters with people who move at your pace.
You&#x27;re fast. Not &quot;I&#x27;ll get it done eventually&quot; fast—actually fast. You ship features while others are still in planning meetings. You&#x27;ve probably built multiple projects that real people use, and you did it without a massive team or budget. You&#x27;re also restless. The idea of maintaining legacy code at a Fortune 500 company makes you want to quit tech entirely.
Top 1-5% LLM user (you&#x27;re already building with AI)

Track record of shipping user-facing applications

Strong design intuition (your work doesn&#x27;t look like developer art)

Excellent communication (you can explain complex things simply)

Ownership mentality and agency (you see problems and fix them)

Open to feedback and accountable for results

Proof you&#x27;ve worked on multiple projects

2+ years experience, authorized to work in the US
You&#x27;ll work across frontend development (React&#x2F;TypeScript), backend services (Node.js), AI integration and development, and infrastructure (GCP). We&#x27;re not looking for a specialist—we need someone who can move between these areas as needed.
Growth: Steven has a track record of turning promising engineers into exceptional ones. Equity: We&#x27;re early enough that your equity could be life-changing, growing fast enough that it won&#x27;t take a decade to find out. Problems: You&#x27;ll work on cutting-edge AI applications, not CRUD apps or marketing websites.
Perfect for new grads who can demonstrate exceptional velocity and AI-native thinking, or experienced engineers who haven&#x27;t been slowed down by corporate processes.
