LaunchDarkly - Staff Distributed Systems Engineer - Remote (US) - Full-time

Hi, I&#x27;m the hiring manager for the Flag Delivery team at LaunchDarkly. We&#x27;re building and scaling the Flag Delivery Network - a globally distributed, high-throughput system that delivers hundreds of thousands to millions of real-time feature flag updates per second to SDKs across web, mobile, and server environments.

We work on challenges like streaming delivery, edge caching, global state synchronization, and operational excellence at scale. If you enjoy designing, building and running distributed systems that need to be fast, reliable, and observable - we&#x27;d love to hear from you.
