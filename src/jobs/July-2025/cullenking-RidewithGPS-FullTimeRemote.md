Ride with GPS - Full Time Remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ridewithgps.com&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ridewithgps.com&#x2F;about</a>

We are the world&#x27;s largest library of bike routes, and we enable cyclists to go on better rides, more often. We have a website and mobile apps that allow people to discover the best riding in their area, and get turn by turn navigation using either our mobile apps or the bike computer of their choosing. Come join us in taking Ride with GPS to the next level! We have two openings right now, and are starting to build out the hiring plan for a third:

Senior Software Engineer - API &amp; Product Development: We are looking for an experienced backend engineer to join our small and effective engineering team with a focus on supporting web and mobile app development using our APIs. The right candidate for this role brings extensive experience supporting modern product development, in collaboration with frontend and mobile developers, product management, and design. This requires excellent communication and collaboration skills, both on the engineering side, and from a product perspective. We use rails, but prior rails experience is not required.

Senior Software Engineer - API Development: We are looking for an experienced backend engineer to join our small and effective team with a focus on our APIs and supporting our platform at scale. This doesn&#x27;t mean you are isolated from product development &amp;emdash; everything we do serves our users in some way, and being a small team we regularly share responsibilities. However, this role will spend more time on efficiency and system design rather than delivering this quarter&#x27;s new features. The right candidate should have a depth of experience supporting a large API surface area with efficient, well organized code, and should be excited about maintaining and improving performance over time. Experience with developer tooling, database design, query optimization, and DevOps workflows will serve you well in this role. We use rails, but prior rails experience is not required.

Senior Software Engineer - iOS Development: In mid July, we will officially start the hiring process for an iOS developer, and potentially another Android engineer. We are reviewing applications for qualified candidates at this time, and will officially post the job by July 15th. If you think you are an excellent fit please apply now, however there might be some delays in screening, interviewing, etc while we finalize our hiring plan. We have a technically interesting, battery efficient set of mobile apps that act as a companion to our website, and need another iOS or Android engineer to help us take our apps to the next level.
