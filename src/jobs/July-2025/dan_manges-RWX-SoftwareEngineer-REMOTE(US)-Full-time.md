RWX - Software Engineer - REMOTE (US) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rwx.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rwx.com</a>

$175K â€“ $250K + equity

We&#x27;re a CI&#x2F;CD platform with an entirely differentiated execution model. Rather than parallelizing jobs on VMs, we provide a serverless interface using a graph of tasks. We then have automatic, content-based caching, which eliminates the large amount of redundant executions that CI platforms have today. You can test changes from a local CLI so that you don&#x27;t have to commit and push to run. We&#x27;ve made substantial improvements to every aspect of the developer experience.

We&#x27;re looking for backend-focused engineers who excel at building developer tools. Our engineers are effectively product managers as well and work highly autonomously.
