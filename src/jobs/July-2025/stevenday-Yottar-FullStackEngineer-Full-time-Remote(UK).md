Yottar - Full Stack Engineer - Full-time - Remote (UK)

Yottar is a startup on a mission to speed up the shift to clean energy. We’re building a SaaS platform that helps energy developers figure out where they can connect new infrastructure - like EV chargers, batteries, or solar - to the electricity grid. The team today is three co-founders and we have just raised our first funding round primarily to increase the size of our tech team, so that we can accelerate our platform development.

We&#x27;re looking for an experienced Full Stack Engineer who&#x27;s excited to build something from the ground up and help shape both the product and how we build it alongside the CTO (me). The ideal candidate is someone who happy making decisions, owning solutions end-to-end and working with a high degree of autonomy. Our tech stack is boring: Django, Python, PostGIS and we&#x27;re proud of that.

- Location: Remote, UK (with in person meetings, travel paid, no more than monthly)
- Salary: £70-100k + generous equity (based on experience and competence)
- Deadline for Applications: 16 July
