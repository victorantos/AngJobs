Lore (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.lore.co</a>) - Software&#x2F;Machine-Learning&#x2F; Data Engineers + More! - Full-time - REMOTE (US)

The company: Modern healthcare excels at treating fallout, but it struggles to address triggers—because it wasn’t built to. Yet intervening at these trigger points isn’t just how we stop rising demand; it’s how we create more health and happiness. We started Lore to build a new kind of care: a continuous, holistic approach that supports people whether they’re flourishing, struggling, or somewhere in between. We call it preemptive care.

The role:

<pre><code>  - Small, cross-functional squads that own the full vertical slice of a problem space.

  - No product or project managers—you&#x27;re the one driving decisions and implementing them in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment.

  - Working fully remote across the US means you need strong written communication and the ability to work asynchronously. Whether you&#x27;re deep in technical details or connecting ideas across disciplines, clear communication is essential.

  - We value the expertise you bring, but when new information comes along, we also need you to adapt quickly, challenge old assumptions, and embrace new ideas.

  - If you thrive in an environment that rewards bold ideas, continuous learning, and active engagement in every aspect of the business and want to help people become more agentic, Lore might be the perfect place for you.
