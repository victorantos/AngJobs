Stellar - Software Engineer - Amsterdam, Netherlands, EU - Onsite&#x2F;Hybrid - Full-time

We&#x27;re building AI voice agents for enterprise contact centers. We focus on remarkably human-like conversations, regulated environments and support for non-English markets (Dutch, German, French, etc.).

All our founders can code, but we&#x27;re growing and getting busy quickly. So, we are looking for a (senior) Software Engineer: Go&#x2F;TypeScript (Encore.dev&#x2F;React). If you&#x27;re strong in other languages, entrepreneurial and eager to learn, we&#x27;d still love to talk. Build core platform features, guardrails, integrations, and tools that help our AI agents handle millions of customer calls.

You&#x27;ll thrive here if you:

- Want high ownership and direct customer impact

- Prefer building directly with users vs. in isolation

- Enjoy technical challenges at the intersection of AI&#x2F;audio&#x2F;enterprise

- Have the ambition to grow into a technical leadership role as the team grows
