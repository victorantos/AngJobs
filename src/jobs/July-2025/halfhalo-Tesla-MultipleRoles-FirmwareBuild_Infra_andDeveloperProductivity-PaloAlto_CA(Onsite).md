Tesla - Multiple Roles - Firmware Build, Infra, and Developer Productivity - Palo Alto, CA (Onsite)

The Firmware Build team within Vehicle Software is responsible for the tools, frameworks, and systems required to build firmware at scale.  For us, a full firmware build for all current production vehicles &amp; stationary storage products uses more than 6000 cpu cores and 4TB of memory concurrently, and we do a _lot_ of simultaneous builds.

The team owns the core build cluster and framework itself, along with ancillary systems such as the local development environment, the interfaces developers use to trigger builds and view the results, and a whole whackton of others.

We currently have the following roles open:
* Fullstack engineer (React, Typescript, Python, Go) - Focusing on our web applications and build framework <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;search&#x2F;job&#x2F;sr-fullstack-software-engineer-build-infrastructure-239547" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;search&#x2F;job&#x2F;sr-fullstack-softwa...</a>

* Distributed Systems Engineer (Python, Linux, Go) - Focusing on our build framework and underlying cluster <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;search&#x2F;job&#x2F;software-engineer-distributed-systems-build-infrastructure-225465" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;search&#x2F;job&#x2F;software-engineer-d...</a>

* SRE (Python, Linux, Puppet, Ansible) - Focusing on our underlying cluster and related infra (We own our compute from the moment it gets racked).
