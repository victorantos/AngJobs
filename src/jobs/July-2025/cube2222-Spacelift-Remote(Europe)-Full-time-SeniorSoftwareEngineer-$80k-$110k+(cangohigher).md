Spacelift - Remote (Europe) - Full-time - Senior Software Engineer - $80k-$110k+ (can go higher)

We&#x27;re a VC-funded startup building an infrastructure orchestrator and collaborative management platform for Infrastructure-as-Code â€“ from OpenTofu, Terraform, Terragrunt, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Kubernetes, to Ansible.

On the backend we&#x27;re using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We&#x27;re looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps&#x27;y stuff sometimes (because in a way it&#x27;s the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you&#x27;d have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.

Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don&#x27;t give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours.

If that sounds like fun to you, please apply at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.spacelift.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;3006934-software-engineer-remote-europe-mid-and-senior" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.spacelift.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;3006934-software-engineer-...</a>

You can find out more about the product we&#x27;re building at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacelift.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacelift.io</a> and also see our engineering blog for a few technical blog posts of ours: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacelift.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;engineering" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacelift.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;engineering</a>

*Additionally*, we&#x27;re hiring for a new product we&#x27;re building, Flows[0] (first time posting this publicly, actually!). Mostly the same requirements and tech stack, without the devops bits. If you&#x27;d like to apply specifically for that, just mention &quot;new product&quot; in the cover letter field.
