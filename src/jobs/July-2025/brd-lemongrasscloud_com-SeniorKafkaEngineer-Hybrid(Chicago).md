lemongrasscloud.com - Senior Kafka Engineer - Hybrid (Chicago)

Lemongrass is a SAP focused consultancy support customers as they look to keep up with SAP&#x27;s &quot;migration to the cloud&quot;.

We not so infrequently run into Frankenstein solutions built by our customers that need to be understood, cleaned up, and then potentially right sized or retired. If you enjoy and&#x2F;or have experience rolling up your sleeves, diving into a poorly documented Kafka deployments, and coming out the other side the hero with crisp documentation in hand and a plan for longer term re-architecture activity, I&#x27;ve got the role for you.

If interested I&#x27;d love to talk to you, reach out to bdennett at lemongrasscloud.com
