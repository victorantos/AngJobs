Phrasing - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app</a> - Elixir + Clojure + Swift - Technical Co-founder - EU REMOTE (Amsterdam&#x2F;Lisbon)

I’m going to be honest with you: I want to be the best in the world at what I do. I’m not there yet, but I know I am willing to put in the hours, and fail as many times as it takes for me to get there.

For that reason, Phrasing to me is more than just a language learning application. It’s a chance to do something different. A chance to build a product that *pushes humanity forward*. A chance to build experiences that are genuinely *delightful*. A chance to build a company that can *inspire*.

I’ve built the current version entirely myself (not even a single like of AI generated code). On the good side: the product is working, I’m using it every day to genuinely learn 18 languages, and the user base is growing. On the bad side: the onboarding flow needs a lot of work, the pipelines keep breaking, and the maintenance burden is too much for me to handle alone and make progress on the product at the same time.

I’m looking for an engineer to join in a co-founding capacity and help me build something truly great. You would assume responsibility of the backend Elixir application, while I spearhead the various frontends (web, mobile, design, marketing). You’d make sure every task succeeds, keep queries times minimal, and optimize the crap out of the data and the infra. On the product &amp; leadership side—we would collaborate on everything. I believe strongly that the best ideas are born of two minds.

And to tie it all together, I’m looking for someone else that wants to be great. Someone who wants to do things differently, someone who isn’t afraid to chase their dream and take their shot.

No experience for this role is necessary. All I care about is that you’re competent, passionate and hungry.

If you feel like this is you, then send a well written introduction to hn [at] phrasing [dot] app. Any AI applications will be ignored and the senders blocked.
