P-1 AI - Hybrid (SF) and Remote (US) roles - Full time

P-1 is trying to do for physical engineering (mechanical, aerospace, electrical), what Devin, Cursor *et al.* are doing for the software world. Founded by ex Airbus execs and DARPA program managers, we&#x27;ve just raised a $23 million seed round. Our goal is to solve engineering AGI to enable humans to scale engineering complexity by orders of magnitude.

We have several roles open including:

* Research Scientist - Applied AI

Looking for creative people to innovate on agentic AI systems for specialized engineering domains.

* ML Engineer - Training and AI Infra (ad should post tomorrow)

We&#x27;re doing a lot of LLM fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We need someone who can make our GPU cluster sing!

* Software Engineer - AI Evals and Test

We believe it&#x27;s essential develop rigorous, domain-specific evaluations in order to ensure we&#x27;re making progress on real world issues -- not just hill-climbing on general purpose benchmarks.

... and more!
