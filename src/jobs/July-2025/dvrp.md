San Francisco, CA; Full-time &amp; Onsite; Member of technical staff.

I&#x27;m the cofounder of Krea (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.krea.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.krea.ai&#x2F;</a>), a startup in San
Francisco building browser-based creative tools and AI systems
focused on personalization, controllability, aesthetics, and speed.
We are also working real-time video models and world models.

Some customers: Pixar, Shopify, Fox News, Amazon Studios.

We are ~15 technical staff members (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.krea.ai&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.krea.ai&#x2F;careers</a>)
looking for others interested in tackling challenges in the creative
tooling (with AI) space.  We have a lot of GPUs and plan on
getting more.

Some challenges: large-scale training of diffusion models; post-training
such models using techniques like DPO; UI testing framework to
simulate user actions; distillation of state-of-the-art models like
Flux to achieve real-time performance at inference-time; zero-downtime
and blue-green deployments; recommendation systems for user-content;
vector-based search API for filtering through millions of user
assets; multi-cloud multi-cluster infrastructure management;
enterprise-grade granular access control similar to how Linux ACLs
work.

Some investors: cofounder of Meta&#x2F;Facebook AI Research, founding
member of OpenAI, a16z.

Our tech stack: CUDA, PyTorch, Kubernetes, Tigris, Node, Svelte(Kit),
WebGL&#x2F;WebGPU&#x2F;WASM, Python, Ceph.
