Nooks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nooks.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nooks.ai</a>) - Software Engineers (full-stack &amp; backend&#x2F;applied ML) - Full-time - Onsite in SF (hybrid)

Hi, I&#x27;m on the recruiting team at Nooks — we’re a Series B co using AI to reimagine the future of work for sales teams.

- What: Our AI Sales Assistant Platform (ASAP) automates the busywork in dialing, prospecting, and coaching so reps can focus on the human side of selling.

- Fun engineering challenges: These include complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms &amp; infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You&#x27;ll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)

- Funding and traction: We closed a $43M Series B from Kleiner Perkins in Q4&#x27;24. We 4x’d ARR in both 2023 and 2024. We&#x27;ve had tremendous revenue growth since closing the B, acquiring customers like Hubspot, Windsurf and LaunchDarkly.

- Team: Our team includes many former unicorn early team members and founders, as well as multiple IMO&#x2F;IOI medalists

We&#x27;re looking for experienced engineers and an EM. To work at Nooks, you should love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers. Excitement about language models, few-shot learning and other recent AI advances is also a plus :)
