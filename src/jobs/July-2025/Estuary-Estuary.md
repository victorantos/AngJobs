Estuary is a VC-backed startup building the next generation of real-time data infrastructure. Our platform, Estuary Flow, combines change data capture (CDC), stream processing, and declarative configuration to unify real-time and batch data movement.

We’re open-source, developer-first, and focused on making data engineering radically simpler.

We’re a small, high-trust team with deep experience in distributed systems, stream processing, and data tooling — and we’re growing.

We’re hiring for:

Senior Backend Engineer (Integrations) – 5+ years of backend engineering experience. Proficiency in Go...Rust is a big bonus!

Own and scale high-impact systems that power real-time data pipelines. You’ll work on complex integrations with external APIs and databases, improve our internal connector frameworks, and tackle deep challenges in performance, reliability, and developer experience.

Backend Engineer (Integrations) – 2–4 years of backend experience. Help expand and maintain our catalog of real-time data connectors using Python. You’ll work closely with experienced engineers to build and optimize integrations with third-party systems, while deepening your skills in infrastructure and stream processing.

What we’re looking for:

We’re looking for engineers who care about building reliable, maintainable systems and enjoy working with complex APIs and data flows. We value curiosity, clear communication, and a willingness to learn.

Bonus points for experience with CDC tools, open source contributions, or fast-paced startups.
