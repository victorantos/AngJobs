Treez - Multiple roles - REMOTE (India) - Full-time -

We’re a Series C US-based startup building an SDK and a platform that powers compliant payments in regulated industries. You’ll join a high-context, low-process team that’s built critical systems. We care about clean abstractions, good alerting, and boring reliability.

Senior SDE:

- Have 5–8 years experience designing and building backend systems (we mostly use Node.js, Python, Postgres).

- Can lead projects, unblock others, and reduce scope smartly to ship.

- Know tradeoffs between queues, retries, transactions, and idempotency.

- Can jump on production issues with clarity.

- Love mentoring, reviewing PRs, and simplifying messy systems.

SDE 2:

- You&#x27;ll own critical paths in our payments stack — from clean APIs to resilient integrations.

- Design for reliability, idempotency, and scale in a high-throughput system.

- Reduce complexity: improve latency, simplify data flows, automate root cause visibility.

- Shape the system, not just the code — with engineers who think in invariants.
