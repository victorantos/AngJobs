CrazyGames - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.crazygames.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.crazygames.com&#x2F;</a> - REMOTE (in Europe) - Full-time - Multiple roles

With recent technologies such as WebGPU and WebAssembly, the browser is quickly becoming a powerful gaming platform. High-quality 3D graphics and near-native level performance are becoming possible without the need for downloads, apps, or platform-specific development. Our browser games platform is already reaching more than 40 million people per month. We are self-funded, profitable, remote-first, and fast-growing.

We are currently looking for multiple people to bring our product, engineering, and marketing to the next level.

Please note that we&#x27;re looking for people who can work on a European timezone and are ideally based in Europe (which includes the UK for those in doubt).
