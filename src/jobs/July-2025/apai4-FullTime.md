Bolt.new &#x2F; StackBlitz.com - Full Time - Remote US&#x2F;EU

—

We’re StackBlitz!

We’re the team behind WebContainers, the groundbreaking technology that made it possible to run Node.js right in your browser. No installs, no setup, just instant dev environments. That innovation kickstarted our journey in 2019 and powers the blazing-fast online IDE used by over a million developers every month.

But we didn’t stop there.

We took everything we learned from building WebContainers and used it to create Bolt.new. The fastest way to go from idea to production without writing traditional code. Think of it as the Canva or Figma for full-stack applications: a next-gen, AI-powered builder that lets you create, edit, and deploy web and mobile apps instantly, right in your browser.

WebContainers make it possible. Bolt.new brings it to life. Together, they reimagine what it means to build software lowering the barrier to entry, speeding up workflows, and unlocking creativity for the next generation of builders.

We’re a globally distributed, fully remote team of passionate engineers, designers, and creatives building the future of software development. If you love shipping fast, solving real problems, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible we’d love to meet you.
