Calico - Senior Engineer - Boston, MA, USA (only) - Hybrid

Calico is a digital assets aggregation startup being incubated by Fidelity Labs.  We offer the unique chance to have the same impact and freedom to build that a startup does, while having the same stability as a large firm. We&#x27;re looking for a seasoned senior backend or full-stack engineer with a collaborative personality and eye for clean code to help build out our team and our aggregation API platform.

Our stack at the moment is React&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;NodeJs&#x2F;Postgres, though if you&#x27;re good at Solidity, you should also reach out.
