AWS - Embedded Firmware Engineer - Austin, TX or Cupertino, CA - Full-time

I&#x27;m a team lead engineer at Annapurna Labs, the small company-within-a-company that designs AWS custom silicon.  My organization designs and runs the Trainium and Inferentia machine learning (ML) accelerators.  Our team is hiring engineers to help build the on-chip firmware stack for new and existing chips.  This firmware is the lowest layer of the Neuron software stack; you can think of it as implementing a silicon-accelerated virtual machine that the Neuron compiler targets.

This is a bare metal, system software-oriented role (think C&#x2F;C++); no specific ML experience is needed, but if you have experience writing GPU&#x2F;CUDA kernels or microcode for other systems, we can definitely put your experience to work.  If you&#x27;re interested in machine learning, you&#x27;ll be adjacent to people who have tons of experience with high performance compute, chip design, and ML algorithms.

We offer relocation to Austin or Cupertino; the team is split evenly between the two sites.

Ping me if you&#x27;re wanting to chat about the team or the role: ghilliar -at- amazon.com. I&#x27;m an embedded systems engineer and I don&#x27;t bite :)
