E2B - SF (US) or Prague (CZ), both on-site - [AI - Platform - Systems - Distributed Systems - Customer Support] Engineer&#x2F;DevRel - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2b.dev&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2b.dev&#x2F;careers</a>

E2B is an open-source infra devtool that gives AI agents cloud computers that we call sandboxes.

We have revenue, customers like Perplexity, Hugging Face, or Mistral, growing fast, multiple years of runway, and a full roadmap of exciting features to build.

I&#x27;d love to chat if you want to help us with some of the scaling challenges, DX, or new products!

Feel free to send me your projects to vasek[at]e2b.dev.
