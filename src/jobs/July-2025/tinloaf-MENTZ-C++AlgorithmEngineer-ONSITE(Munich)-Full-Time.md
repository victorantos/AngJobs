MENTZ - C++ Algorithm Engineer - ONSITE (Munich) - Full-Time

MENTZ builds software for public transit agencies and authorities. One big part of our portfolio is an intermodal journey planning system - think Google&#x2F;Apple Maps, but with a strong focus on public transit.

We&#x27;re looking for a C++ backend dev to join the team working on the public transit router. We are currently in an exciting phase where we&#x27;re working on the current and next generation of that public transit router simultaneously, so this position combines the possibility of having an immediate impact on a widely used product and working on something brand new.

More details (and a way to apply) are available here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.mentz.net&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;c-algorithm-engineer-for-public-transitrouting-m-w-d&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.mentz.net&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;c-algorithm-engineer-for-public-tr...</a>
