Doctors are overworked, burnt out, and are quitting in masses.

I&#x27;m head of engineering at Freed, where we combine clinician love with the latest AI tech and intense execution to create products that make clinicians happier.

Our first product is an AI scribe that automates medical documentation. In 1 year we:

- Acquired 10,000 paying and loving clinicians and exceeded $11M ARR

- Generated 70,000 patient notes daily using ASR and LLMs

- Created a consumer-grade UX, with greater enthusiasm than any product I&#x27;ve seen (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;love.getfreed.ai&#x2F;b2xGQ1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;love.getfreed.ai&#x2F;b2xGQ1</a>)

With the backing of the best VCs in the world, we are rapidly expanding our product offering. Patient facing assistant, patient insights, EHR integrations, and other products are being built and used by thousands of clinicians and millions of patients.

Our engineering culture emphasizes speed, end-to-end ownership, responsibility, and independence. Our tech stack is React and TypeScript &#x2F; Node.js.
