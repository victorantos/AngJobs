‚çÉKalvium, Bangalore, India (onsite&#x2F;hybrid - HSR Layout). Internships (DSA and coding Interns).

Hi folks, I&#x27;m hiring in the engineering curriculum team at Kalvium - the only edtech where we bring a focused, standardized, digital approach to CS higher education. I speak about this on this podcast (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=be1yEJbyEkQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=be1yEJbyEkQ</a>).

We have 6-month internships for DSA Programmers, and Project programmers. This role requires creating code&#x2F;problems&#x2F;projects for our students. Domains include full-stack, data-science, cybersecurity and DevOps. Post internship full-time conversion is also possible basis performance.

Here&#x27;s 3 cool things we&#x27;ve done:

1. 100% AI based evaluators in B.Tech CS 4 year program.

2. Measuring and improving each one of the 4000 hours of the program in the classroom.

2. Launched our full-fledged program in 20+ universities in India, where students are placed from 3rd semester onwards. This year we&#x27;ve had more premium universities signup: SRM, VIT, Christ, etc.

3. Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.

Our main realization is: we can&#x27;t rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve built and launched in above universities (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;heros&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;heros&#x2F;</a>). We have a 12 year roadmap! it&#x27;s a blue ocean, and we want to build and lead Edtech V2.0.

Please reach out to me via anil@kalvium.com with your resume. include your existing competitive coding platform links, coding projects, and any experience of tutoring others on technology. We have a high bar on this selection.
