Delfina [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delfina.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delfina.com</a>] - Software engineers (data, full stack, backend, devops) - ONSITE (hybrid) - NYC, SF, Seattle, Boston

Delfina provides a leading pregnancy care data platform to improve maternal and child health outcomes. Our motivating challenge is the fact that in the United States, healthcare outcomes for pregnancy are significantly worse than in other similarly developed countries. We believe our technology-enabled solutions will help doctors better scale to better use data and in the end, deliver better care to their patients. We are looking for people who believe in our mission to join our team!

We are looking for both junior and mid level software engineers. And weâ€™re
open to backend, frontend, or fullstack positions. It will help if you experience
in one or more of:

- React, Python (FastAPI)
- PostreSQL, GraphQL
- GCP, GitHub Actions
- Beam, Spark, dbt, BigQuery

Experience in healthtech, pregnancy care, machine learning, and design are all valuable as well!
