** Trunk Tools (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trunktools.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trunktools.com&#x2F;</a>) - Engineers - Full-Time - ONSITE NYC or AUSTIN, REMOTE IN US **

Trunk Tools creates software to make construction more efficient and cost effective, we have significant revenue and are growing extremely quickly! We&#x27;re a team with prior experience at SpaceX, PlanGrid, Carta, Y Combinator, LinkedIn, Uber, etc.

We spent the last few years building the brain behind construction. Now we are deploying workflows&#x2F; agents, starting with Q&amp;A document chatbot, to be ingrained in construction teamsâ€™ workflows, ultimately to automate construction. Given our immense traction with several Fortune 500 construction companies,  we are doubling our team in order to deploy several more agents this year. You will have an opportunity to drive the transformation of a multi-trillion-dollar industry full of waste, risks and inefficiencies.

We&#x27;re looking for:

  * Senior+ ML Engineer (NYC, Austin or Remote US) [2]

  * Senior+ Computer Vision &#x2F; CV Engineer (NYC, Austin or Remote US) [3]
