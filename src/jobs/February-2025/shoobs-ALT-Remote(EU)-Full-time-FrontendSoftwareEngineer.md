ALT - Remote (EU) - Full-time - Frontend Software Engineer

We&#x27;re a small, established company specialising in subsurface instrumentation development, as well as the software needed to handle subsurface data. As of right now, we&#x27;re working on a product to streamline management, delivery and visualisation of data.

Currently chasing a frontend developer with a flair for UI&#x2F;UX design, and experience in Vue.js and D3. Must have a strong mathematical background.

Open to employing via company-of-record (such as remote.com), or direct B2B consulting. If you&#x27;re in Luxembourg, we can employ you directly. Reach out to me at jobs &lt;at&gt; alt.lu.
