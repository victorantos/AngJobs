Orica - Australia - Full-Time - REMOTE (AUSTRALIA ONLY)

Our team is building blast design and simulation software. Our tech stack is 100% pure rust. We have a pile of interesting problems to solve: building elegant UX, 3d rendering complex surfaces, simulating explosions, etc.

Really nice team, fully remote (from anywhere in Australia).
