Charge Robotics - Senior Robotics Software Engineer - Full-time - Onsite &#x2F; Hybrid - SF Bay Area

Hi HN! We’re a YC-backed, Series-A startup building robots that build large-scale solar farms.

Check out a video of our first system here! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZZ2fP1Y5Z2E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZZ2fP1Y5Z2E</a>

It turns out that construction companies literally can&#x27;t build solar fast enough, so what we&#x27;re doing is a crucial part of switching the grid over to renewable generation. We&#x27;re looking to bring another talented software engineer onto our small team.

You’ll be a key contributor, helping bring our next generation of mobile solar factory to life. Your work will involve architecting, developing, and maintaining high-quality code and documentation for our fleet of robotic delivery vehicles.

Come work with us if you love:

* Fast-paced prototype development with software and hardware components

* Making a positive climate impact through your work

* Hacking on massive construction equipment!

P.S. I am specifically excited about hiring for this role -- we have a brand new system we&#x27;re building the stack for from the ground up, and this role will have an especially big impact imo.
