AudioDiary <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiodiary.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiodiary.ai</a> - Flutter&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Express&#x2F;TS&#x2F;TypeORM&#x2F;Next - Fully remote, based in London, UK - part-time

We are a fully bootstrapped company and we&#x27;ve recently started making enough to be able to afford a part-time intern. AudioDiary is a modern journalling app made with love and we have users telling us personally on a daily basis that it&#x27;s making a meaningful change to their lives. This role will exceed full-stack expectations in the sense that you&#x27;ll be encouraged to take full control over your features, coding them up, but also talking to users, thinking about UX design, graphic design, and any other important jobs that makes a startup work. In general, we&#x27;ll be there for guidance and to help you get things over the line, but will give you as much autonomy and choice as is possible, so you can choose your own work.

The stipend for this is limited, but it will be completely part-time, on a choose-your-own-hours kind of basis and would be a fantastic learning experience on a real world project for a creative and talented dev early on in their career.

If you&#x27;re interested, check out the app and landing page, and send an email to hello@audiodiary.ai
