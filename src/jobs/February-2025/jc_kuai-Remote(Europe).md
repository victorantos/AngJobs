YASO [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goyaso.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goyaso.com</a>] - Remote (Europe) - Freelance &#x2F; Full-time, Full Stack Engineer

We power social commerce success for the most successful European D2C beauty and personal care brands in China, the worldâ€™s largest ecommerce market.

Our solution allows brands to sell through and analyse multiple ecommerce marketplaces with just one integration.

We&#x27;ve built out the China side of our solution and are now hiring a full stack developer in our European team to help take our brand portal to the next level.

We&#x27;re at seed stage but are smashing our metrics and getting ready for a series-A later this year.

We&#x27;re looking for scrappy self-starters who can grow with us on this journey.

Stack: Typescript, React (NextJS 14 app router), Tailwind, Postgres (Supabase)
