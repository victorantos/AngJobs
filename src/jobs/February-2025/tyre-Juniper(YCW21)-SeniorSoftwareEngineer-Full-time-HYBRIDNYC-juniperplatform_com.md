Juniper (YC W21) - Senior Software Engineer - Full-time - HYBRID NYC - juniperplatform.com

Juniper is working to improve the messy financial infrastructure for US Healthcare. We&#x27;ve built an automated end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics. It’s a product that clinicians need and love.

We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing care.

It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections). We track money movement on a unified ledger and reconcile transactions with clinics&#x27; bank accounts.

There is so much more to build. If you&#x27;re interested in scaling data pipelines, programmable rules engines, AI, data science, delightful products for small clinics, processing billions of dollars in money movementm or solving the unsexy problems that make this country&#x27;s healthcare broken, come join us!

We are a team of ~40 with strong product market fit. You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get clinicians back to work delivering care for kids.
