DAYMADE - Senior Software Engineer - Hybrid (London) - Full Time

We are looking for an experienced Software Developer to join our small but mighty startup. Join us in our mission to disrupt the timeless but severely outdated lottery industry and help us spread joy to people’s lives with an exciting product that is tailored to millennials and gen Z. With an “Excellent” rating on TrustPilot, we really live up to our name and are dedicated to building a brand and product experience that makes people’s day.

About the role:
As a Senior Software Engineer, you will play a key role in designing, building, and scaling our platform. Working closely with the founding team and CTO, you’ll support end-to-end delivery of features, contribute to architectural decisions, and ensure our tech stack supports our growth. This is a hands-on role requiring deep technical expertise and a collaborative mindset. While we work mostly from home, we meet once per week in a co-working office to remind each other we are real-life humans, giving ChatGPT a run for their money. The rest of the week we communicate over Slack and Zoom calls (we don’t overdo it)! If you’re good with GIFS, that’s a huge plus.
