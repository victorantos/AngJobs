Accretional - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accretional.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accretional.com</a> - Hybrid (San Francisco) - Full-time &#x2F; Part-time - Founder&#x2F;Entrepreneur in Residence

Accretional is seeking to collaborate with ambitious and innovative entrepreneurs as they build their next software startup. We are intending to directly invest in our entrepreneur partners while providing several other unique benefits.

About us: Accretional is an early stage startup building AI developer tools centered around &quot;agentic workflows&quot;, starting with our product Brilliant. Brilliant allows developers to create and share workflows that are reusable, composable, and customizable. We&#x27;re looking for design partners to validate Brilliant as a way for SaaS companies to expose onboarding and integration workflows to their customers.

What you&#x27;ll get:

* Startup funding via SAFE agreement, with the possibility for more funding later on

* Direct access to Accretional&#x27;s founder and engineering team to assist you in building your product and helping users use your product - think of us as a team of part-time engineers and technical advisors capable of providing you with the best technical support for our product as could ever be possible.

* Direct influence in the development of our product Brilliant

* Use of our spacious office in Jackson Square, San Francisco

* Invitation to networking and technical events with other founders, as well as venture capital investors

What we&#x27;re asking of you:

* In-person collaboration at our office in San Francisco, at least 3 days per week, for a minimum of 6 weeks

* Use our product Brilliant to help you build your software product

* Use Brilliant to build workflows for your users and customers

* Work with us to develop and validate new capabilities for Brilliant

* All the other qualities - ambition, drive, expertise, scrappiness - that investors look for in founders.

We are open to founder teams, developers who are currently employed but seeking to start a company, and developers who are working on open source software. You should be developing a SaaS product.

Interested? Make sure you&#x27;re able to commit to at least 6 weeks of in-person collaboration 3x per week in San Francisco starting sometime in February, and then either email&#x2F;message our founder Fred (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;fred-weitendorf-40b505b6&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;fred-weitendorf-40b505b6&#x2F;</a>) or apply through Linkedin: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view&#x2F;4142972706&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view&#x2F;4142972706&#x2F;</a>
