Langfuse (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfuse.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfuse.com</a>) - Backend Engineer, Product Engineer, Design Engineer - Berlin Germany - in-person - Full-time

I&#x27;m Max, co-founder and CTO of Langfuse (YC W23) - we&#x27;re building open source LLMOps dev tooling (Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;</a>). We started with observability and have branched out into more workflows over time (evals, prompt mgmt, playground, testing...). We have a bunch of traction and are looking for our fourth to sixth hire in scaling and building feature depth. We&#x27;re hiring in person (4-5 days&#x2F;week) in Berlin, Germany (salary ranges for each job 70k-130k, up to 0.35% equity).

We value quality in engineering at Langfuse: We try to find elegant solutions to complex engineering challenges, and we invested significant effort in enhancing our production setup (infra as code, top observability setup and more).

If you&#x27;d love shipping in open source, writing about what you work on and working hard with super interesting and sophisticated customers (devs) - reach out!
