OpenInfer - Various roles - Bay Area ONSITE - Data Center-Scale AI on Edge Devices

Our mission is to bring AI down from the data center to run on your local devices efficiently and to empower them with capabilities not possible when running in a data center due to trust &amp; privacy issues. We&#x27;re a company that&#x27;s left stealth very recently and we&#x27;re very well-funded by top VCs in the Bay Area. Our team has a lot of well-rounded industry experience from big tech companies and successful startup exits. Our work schedule is 3+2 with Tue-Thur being onsite in San Mateo.
