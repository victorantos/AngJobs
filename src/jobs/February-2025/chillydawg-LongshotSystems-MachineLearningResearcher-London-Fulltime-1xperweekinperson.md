Longshot Systems - Machine Learning Researcher - London - Full time - 1x per week in person

We&#x27;re hiring for Machine Learning Researchers at Longshot. If you really enjoy the modelling side of machine learning and like iterating rapidly on your ideas to try and beat the best existing models (think a Kaggle competition, but against the market) youâ€™d be a great fit for this role. Open to the full range of Junior to Senior candidates at the moment, please forward to anyone you think would be a good fit.
