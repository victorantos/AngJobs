Ardent AI - Founding Engineer - REMOTE - Full time - $160-200K, 0.5-2.0% equity

Ardent [0] is a well-funded, early-stage startup founded by an ex-Stripe engineer and three-time founder. We&#x27;re building a platform which helps users blend the creativity of generative AI with the determinism of executable code.

We want to help everyone build software, whether or not they know how to code. *We aren&#x27;t trying to put software engineers out of work* — instead, we envision a future where AI makes it possible for everyone to build software that makes them more efficient, productive, and happier!

We raised ~$2.5M last year, and we&#x27;re hiring two engineers to join the founding team. We&#x27;re looking for highly motivated and talented candidates with experience working on a fully remote team, a strong interest in artificial intelligence, and alignment with our principles and way of working. [1]

Our interview process is efficient, and we don&#x27;t do Leetcode or grueling all-day interview loops. We won&#x27;t waste your time, we will stay in constant contact throughout, and we will get you an answer quickly.
