- You love to build, wrangle, operate, and especially simplify, complex distributed systems.

- You are able to work from our NYC office (or are open to relocation).

Bonus points:

- Familiarity with or interest in ramping up on frontend development (React&#x2F;TypeScript)

- Familiarity with developing and operating software systems that run across a variety of deployment models (e.g. SaaS, BYOC, on-prem).

Compensation: $175–$210K + equity.

Backed by Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed ($100M+ raised). We’re committed to building a diverse, world-class team.
