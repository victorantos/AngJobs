pganalyze - Senior Product Engineer, Senior Solutions Engineer - REMOTE (US&#x2F;Canada) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pganalyze.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pganalyze.com</a>

At pganalyze, we&#x27;re redefining how developers optimize one of the world&#x27;s most popular databases, PostgreSQL. Our software gives companies like Atlassian, Robinhood, and Notion the tools to solve their most complex Postgres performance challenges, ensuring their mission-critical applications run smoothly at scale.

For our Product Engineering role you will be responsible for driving feature development from concept to writing code to deployment. Sometimes you might have to dig deep into Postgres internals to explain information correctly in a visual way. Recent examples of work done by our product engineers include the launch of our Query Tuning Workbooks feature ([0]), our Buffer Cache Monitoring functionality, or our integration with Plan Statistics provided by some Postgres-as-a-service providers.

For our Solutions Engineering role you will directly work with our VP of Sales, as well as our Founder &amp; CEO (me!) on strategic deals, and develop the playbook for integrating pganalyze in complex customer environments. Our team is cross-functional, and our goal is to improve the pganalyze product where we can, to allow repeated delivery of a great customer experience.
