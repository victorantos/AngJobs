The Laboratory for RNA-Based Lifeforms - University of Toronto - Full-Time - ONSITE - RNAlab.ca

Howdy, The Laboratory of RNA-Based Lifeforms based out of UofT is looking for post-doctoral fellows, independent researchers, and&#x2F;or a cloud engineer. We&#x27;re a research computational biology lab at the forefront of massive scale genetics analysis (think petabytes). We have two ongoing projects: (1) Serratus focuses on the discovery of novel RNA viruses and RNA infectious agents. Currently we&#x27;re focusing on identifying cancer-causing viruses in humans. By identifying these viruses, we can develop treatments for them. (2) PlastiDB is a new project where we are searching for enzymes which are capable of bio-remediating microplastics. By reducing microplastics in our environment, we&#x27;re building a cleaner world for the future.

Seeking a full-stack developer who is creative, passionate, and willing to learn. No biology experience is necessary, but it&#x27;s an asset. Key skills: Python&#x2F;R, AWS&#x2F;HPC, postgres, Neo4j&#x2F;graph databases, javascript.
