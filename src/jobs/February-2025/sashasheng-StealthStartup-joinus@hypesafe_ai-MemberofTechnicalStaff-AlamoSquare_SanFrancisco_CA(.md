Stealth Startup - joinus@hypesafe.ai - Member of Technical Staff - Alamo Square, San Francisco, CA (ONSITE) - VISA sponsorship - Full Time

We have been quietly building a new type of general frontier model since mid 2024. We are reinventing the entire LLM stack for real work, focused on reliability and decision-making. We are well funded with a small and fast moving team previously from OpenAI, Google Brain, Meta and Scale.

What makes us exciting:

- You will be working with a small world-class team at the bleeding edge of AI Research

- You will be using AI to solve real world problems reliably (and get 9s of reliability)

- We are still a small group of AI veterans who are excited to mentor the next generation

Ideal Candidate:

- Has spent a lot of time trying to make LLMs useful and understands their limitations

- Has previously accomplished big things

- 11x coder: Has put in their 11,000 hours coding

- Obsessed with solving real-world problems with AI

- Loves being part of a team

- Thinks working with customers sounds fun

- Obsessed with making LLMs reliable

- Ready to go all-in

Open Roles:

We have roles open for extremely talented software engineers who want to transition into cutting edge AI research engineering

Please include the following in your email:

- Your resume + GitHub + LinkedIn

- What are some of your previous experiences that you feel proud to share?

- What do you think is the biggest bottleneck from LLMs automating more work? (Bonus points: go deeper than just “reliability”)

- If LLMs actually were reliable, which industries would you be the most excited to disrupt?
