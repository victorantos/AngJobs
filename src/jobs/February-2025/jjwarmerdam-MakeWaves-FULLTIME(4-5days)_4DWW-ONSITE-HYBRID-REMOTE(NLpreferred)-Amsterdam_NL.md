Make Waves - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makewaves.fm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makewaves.fm</a> - Senior Python &#x2F; Full stack developers - FULLTIME (4-5 days), 4DWW - ONSITE - HYBRID - REMOTE (NL preferred) - Amsterdam, NL

Make Waves is building a kinder, more helpful platform for independent artists to release their music and build a following. By providing artists with easy-to-understand tools and insights in a notoriously over-complicated industry, we empower DIY artists to control their careers without making concessions.

Over the last years we&#x27;ve proved our model and founding team. We&#x27;re now slowly focusing more on the promotional side of the lifecycle, with some brand new and shiny projects in the pipeline, and trying to simplify the distribution process even more while we learn more.

We are actively looking for some senior developers (full stack or python focused). Unfortunately we canâ€™t offer relocation or visa sponsorship.
