Supabase.io - Customer Solution Architect &#x2F; Engineer - Full-time - REMOTE (US)

I am one of the first SAs at Supabase and our role is to help onboard, optimise and advise on all parts of the Supabase platform.

No need to be a postgres expert, you will be working with customers of all sizes and using all aspects of the platform. One minute you might be onboarding an engineering team and the next you might be helping an existing customer with their scaling plans for the next 6 months or triaging a bug&#x2F;feature request to ensure the Product team understands the context and priority.
Technical skills are vital but &quot;self-starter&quot; is equally key. Being able to determine what cases need your attention compared to those that need escalating to Product or Engineering. Excellent comms skills (internal and external) certainly help, too!

I wanted to work at Supabase because of its open source nature and I want to stay here because of its fully remote, autonomous nature. Trust first in the work we do and it is easy to grab a member of the team to solve a problem async.
