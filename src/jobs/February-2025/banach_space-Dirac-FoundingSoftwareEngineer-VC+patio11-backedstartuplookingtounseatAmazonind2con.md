Dirac - Founding Software Engineer - VC+patio11-backed startup looking to unseat Amazon in d2c online retail - London - in-person

Merry February! About us: a small team (four in the office) working on the logistics, purchasing and warehousing stack required to sell O(£10^10)+ of d2c consumer goods sales p&#x2F;a by 2030. We had sales of £407,000 in January, up 3.76x on Jan &#x27;24.

You&#x27;ll be helping build the software backend for our operations. That means integrations for new marketplaces and suppliers, accountancy, pricing and order optimisation, logistics etc. You&#x27;ll be reporting to the co-founder&#x2F;ceo but also reviewing his code &lt;&#x27;the most disorganised code I have seen in my entire life&#x27; said one person in a code review, apologies!!!&gt; :)

What we do: we buy stock from suppliers and sell it online. Stock purchasing and logistics is handled by an internal backend which you will be helping to write!

About you: &gt;2σ on ambition, &gt;2.5σ technically. Formidable with some business sense. Wants to drive a forklift (our office and warehouse are on the same site).

Email ethan at dirac dot software if interested!!!
