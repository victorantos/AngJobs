Wyndly - Organic &amp; Social Media Marketing - $45K - $60K &#x2F; 0.01% - 0.10% - Remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wyndly.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wyndly.com</a>

Wyndly is making specialty healthcare convenient and affordable, starting with allergy care. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered. We’ve already done this for thousands of patients, and we plan to do it for millions.

The Role

We’re looking for an ambitious organic &amp; social media manager who is ready to jump in and own our earned channels and grow the business. We’ve grown a following across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. In parallel, we have a successful blog that ranks for many keywords. The foundation is laid and we’re ready for someone to level up these channels.

We’re a high growth team doubling revenue over the next year. We know that every hire will change our business so as you grow our social media and content channels you’ll work with our Head of Marketing and cofounders to define how Wyndly evolves. This role can look very different in a year.

We already get 1M&#x2F;views per month across our videos and website. We want to triple this by the end of the year.

Our immediate goals are to get social media and our blog driving new visits to our website. But as this program grows, this role can lean into partnerships, content marketing, copywriting, or video. If we do our jobs well, you’ll have a hand in hiring our marketing team to take on the channels you helped launch.
