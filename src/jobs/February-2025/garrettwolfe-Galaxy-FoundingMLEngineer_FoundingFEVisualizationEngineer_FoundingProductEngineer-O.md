Galaxy is the Cursor for DB Querying, purpose-built for devs to make your querying faster (with a context-aware AI-copilot) and more collaborative, so you 10x your querying output and never have to share queries in slack again. We have collected some of the most deeply skilled data engineers there are to build this platform from some of the greatest startups of 2020 and beyond.

Together, we&#x27;re making data sexy.
