Olli Health - New York or Remote (US work auth required) - Full-Time - Senior ML Engineer or Full Stack SDE - ollihealth.ai

We are a TechStars NYC ‘24 startup dedicated to modernizing home healthcare with advanced AI tools and we are growing! This is a pivotal hands-on role that will begin shaping our product from day 1. Last summer we closed our Seed round from top healthtech and AI-focused VCs investors (Cannage Capital, Arkitekt Ventures, and Tau Ventures) and have been moving lightning fast to build incredibly valuable tools in home health.

We are further expanding our team and are looking for:

- Proven success in the fast-paced 0 to 1 early days of young startups (experience on founding team or pre-seed ideally). This is a full stack role in the widest sense - there is devops, a little data engineering, API design, workflow optimization, and frontend feature design. Work will be optimized based on your preferred balance, and what gives you energy, but we need someone who is able to gain confidence in the full stack.

- Experience (5 years+) with most of our stack: AWS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Python (FastAPI), Pytorch, React

- Able to demonstrate hands-on-keyboard coding chops. Role is primarily IC + collaboration with our team, and room to grow into startup leadership.

- Comfort interacting with ML&#x2F;NLP and LLM-native data engineering problems

- Experience working with healthcare data (not required but highly valued)

Comp: $175k-$200k annual FTE base comp + equity package. We cover 100% of Health, Vision, Dental, Life insurance premiums.

I’m Olli’s CTO and this position will work directly with me and our core (currently 4-person) engineering team. hiring+hn [] ollihomehealth [] ai - Email me with questions, for a full JD, or to send your CV. No staffing or recruiting firms, please, individuals only.
