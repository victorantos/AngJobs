Auricle - Founding Biomechanical Engineer (Neurotech Medical Device) - ONSITE (Mountain View, CA) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auricle.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auricle.com</a>

Auricle is developing a next-generation neurostimulation implant to restore hearing and the ability to understand speech in the millions of people who no longer benefit from acoustic amplification with hearing aids but who aren&#x27;t prepared to take on the risks of a cochlear implant.

We&#x27;re searching for a full-time engineer to join our founding team. Our device and prototypes are partly mechanical, electrical and software so we&#x27;ll need someone who can wear multiple hats but is comfortable primarily in the mechanical domain as we execute on early clinical and pre-clinical studies.

Experience with rapid prototyping using 3D printing, CAD and bench models is a must. Experience of medical device development within a quality management system and developing pre-clinical models is highly valued. Bonus points for electrical engineering experience, programming experience (Python&#x2F;Matlab) and a passion for auditory science. More than anything, we&#x27;re looking for someone who will be highly motivated to help bring a complex but life changing device to patients.

We&#x27;re a small team formed out of Stanford and backed by YC (W21), based out of Fogarty Innovation in Mountain View. The role is primarily in-person with very occasional travel to study sites and with some flexibility for hybrid work from time to time.

We&#x27;re excited to hear from you! francis@auricle.com
