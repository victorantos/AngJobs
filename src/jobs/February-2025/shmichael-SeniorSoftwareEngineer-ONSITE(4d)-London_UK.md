<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kulipa.xyz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kulipa.xyz</a> - Senior Software Engineer - ONSITE (4d) - London, UK

MISSION

Kulipa issues Visa&#x2F;MasterCard cards backed by stablecoins.

It matters to people who do not have access to a fully open banking system (e.g. Argentina).

TECH

We synchronize the card payment network with blockchains and non-custodial wallets. It&#x27;s quite complex to manage a ledger you don&#x27;t fully control, so we&#x27;re treading new ground here.

TEAM

We believe in the 2 pizza rule: We hire as few people as possible, at the highest possible bar. We have some ex-Meta &amp; Google L7s, for instance. 5 engineers currently at the company.

YOU

Senior engineers with backend experience. Smart and excited. All the rest is bonus: Blockchain, Typescript, AWS.
