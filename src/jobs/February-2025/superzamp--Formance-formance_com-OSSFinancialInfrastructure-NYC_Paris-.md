Currently hiring for Product Engineers [1], with a background in fintech&#x2F;payments to work on our ledgering, reconciliation, and accounting systems. We have a highly modular product architecture, so this is a very good opportunity for a technical person who want to drive and own a scope of our platform moving forward.

We don&#x27;t really care about your tech-stack background in the sense that adapting to ours is the easy part if you have enough experience already. Everything is open-sourced at github.com&#x2F;formancehq if you want to check it out.

Location: Paris, FR or Europe (Remote)
Compensation: Above â‚¬75K with equity, exact offer based on experience.
