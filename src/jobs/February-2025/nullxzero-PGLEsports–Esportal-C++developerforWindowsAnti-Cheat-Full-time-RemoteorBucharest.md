PGL Esports – Esportal - C++ developer for Windows Anti-Cheat - Full-time - Remote or Bucharest - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esportal.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esportal.com</a>

Esportal is a competitive platform for major eSports titles powered by PGL Esports (PGL Majors rings a bell?). Our in-house and from-scratch built Anti-Cheat is currently focusing on Counter-Strike 2 @ Windows 10+11 x64. We’re looking for a passionate C++ developer who *loves* crunching lines of code. We have many ideas that want to be implemented by you.

Who you are: You’re comfortable with coding. You know modern C++. You likely spent 5+ years as a (hobby?) programmer and have made a lot of mistakes and learned from those. You survived nights in front of the holy Visual Studio debugger on Windows. You used Git and merge workflows. You were annoyed by linker errors and had victories over clang or MSVC. You know what a mutex is and think in terms of CPU slices. You favor native over Electron. You secretly dream at night to have hair like Bjarne.

What you maybe did: You’ve built your own home automation? Your own game? Your own container implementation? Your own CI? Your own OS? Your own programming language? We want you!

What you will be doing: You will implement code according to specification (you can influence those of course), work on our backlog and go on bug hunting sessions with a debugger. You will be working together with us and will not shy away from asking us questions proactively by talking&#x2F;writing in fluent English. You will be enjoying cheat vendors catching up to us and playing the cat and mouse game with them.

What we offer: Small dedicated remote-first and open-minded team. Well-architectured code base originated in 2022 using C++23. Your code will partially run in Windows kernel mode. We don’t have scheduled meetings. We *talk* on the spot and are always available for help. We don’t care about your working hours if you are available during UTC+2 in the warmup period of some months.
