Mingla - Senior Software Engineer (Elixir) - Stockholm, Sweden. REMOTE (EU) might be an option - Full Time

Mingla makes software for gamified networking at physical events. The days when social gatherings were for extroverts are over. Gamified networking elevates your experience to grasp every ounce of lost event potential and removes much of the anxiety some people feel when thrown in a room full of strangers.

We&#x27;re a strong founding team with several serial entrepreneurs with multiple exits and world renowned brands created. We&#x27;re looking for a senior engineer to push our Phoenix LiveView app further as we scale up this year (next up is the superbowl this weekend, a lot of interesting stuff already underway). Ideally starting in a few weeks, but it&#x27;s more important that you are the right person.

We believe you&#x27;re a person that loves the less structured and and changing landscape of an early company, and if you haven&#x27;t used Elixir, Phoenix LiveView and Ash before you view that as something fun rather than terrifying.

If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at chris [at] mingla.io
