This role requires a strong design sense and an eye for detail, as well as a deep understanding of UX and accessibility best practices.

The ideal candidate will have:

* An extensive knowledge of SCSS&#x2F;SASS and HTML

* The ability to work well within large legacy systems and constraints

* A desire to build, expand, and maintain complex design systems

* An interest in implementing accessibility standards and semantic code

About Combinaut:

* Our team is international (Germany! New Zealand! Spain! Canada!) and all remote, but mostly overlaps with the Pacific or Central time zone.

* Our developers work with near-autonomy toward shared goals. We don&#x27;t micro-manage. Everyone on our team is trusted to manage their own day, and we value good results over process.

* Well-funded team with great cash flow and an established client base.
