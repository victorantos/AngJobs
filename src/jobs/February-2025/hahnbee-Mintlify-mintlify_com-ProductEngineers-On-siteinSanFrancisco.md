Mintlify - mintlify.com - Product Engineers - On-site in San Francisco

Join us in our mission to empower developers worldwide! We&#x27;re a developer documentation platform that helps companies build and maintain public-facing documentation (X, Anthropic, Scale AI and over 20% of the last YC batch).

As for the team, we&#x27;re builders at heart. Our small-but-mighty team is going from 0 to 1, laying down the foundations, and scaling (yes, all of the above). We prioritize attention to detail and are passionate about building tasteful user experiences.

If you’re ready to do impactful, hands-on work, we’re ready to chat.
