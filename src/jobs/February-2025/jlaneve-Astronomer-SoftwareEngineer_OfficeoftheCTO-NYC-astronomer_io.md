Astronomer - Software Engineer, Office of the CTO - NYC - astronomer.io

Astronomer is a Series C data infra startup building a data ops platform for our customers on top of Apache Airflow. Airflow is one of the largest open-source data projects, allowing users to write, run, and scale data pipelines in Python. It&#x27;s downloaded over 30m times a month!

The core of this role is to experiment with new ideas and build prototypes. As a Software Engineer in the Office of the CTO, you will act as a “hacker in residence” - someone with the freedom to experiment, explore big ideas, and validate concepts. You’ll be a generalist, working with whatever technology, tools, and programming languages are required to validate an idea. For the ideas that do work out, we work hand-in-hand with the broader product and engineering teams to turn the idea into a customer-facing feature or new product.

There’s a particular focus on how Generative AI will change the lives of data professionals over the next 3-5 years. We want to lead the market with both a perspective and set of products on how AI will evolve from a human-driven copilot to a set of fully autonomous agents.
