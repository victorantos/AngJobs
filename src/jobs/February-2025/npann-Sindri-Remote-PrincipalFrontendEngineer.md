Sindri - Remote - Principal Frontend Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sindri.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sindri.app&#x2F;</a>

We’re building a platform for zero-knowledge infrastructure automation (“Vercel for zk”). Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic primitive that break the decentralization&#x2F;scalability tradeoff. Sindri already powers some of the largest zk-based chains and apps in Web3.

Seeking our Principal Frontend Engineer to own all things React, shape the developer experience, and define the frontend architecture.

Join a small team of PhDs and experts in cryptography and cloud engineering, backed by leading early stage investors.
