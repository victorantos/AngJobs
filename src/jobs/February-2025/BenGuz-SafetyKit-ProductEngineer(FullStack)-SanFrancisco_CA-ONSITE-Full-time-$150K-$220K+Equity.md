We scrape the internet for illegal content, flagging drugs, endangered animals, transaction laundering, IP infringement, and hundreds of other violations. We work for payment processors and marketplaces including Upwork, Faire, Patreon, Character.ai, Substack, and Eventbrite.

You are thoughtful, opinionated, and fast. You can own the product pipeline, from user interviews to design to pushing code that the engineering, policy, and operation teams using SafetyKit will love.

SafetyKit is started by repeat founders, YC-backed, and growing fast.
