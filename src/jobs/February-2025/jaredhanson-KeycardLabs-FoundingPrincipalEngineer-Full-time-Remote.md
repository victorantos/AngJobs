Keycard Labs - Founding Principal Engineer - Full-time - Remote

Keycard Labs is fundamentally rethinking infrastructure security, by moving from a world of static secrets and API keys to dynamically-issued, short-lived tokens.  In that process, we are delivering an experience developers love, while making it easy to collaborate with teams that operate and secure applications.

This is your chance to build foundational technology that sits at the heart of developer and security workflow.  We&#x27;ve all experienced the pain of managing secrets in traditional service-to-service authentication.  That pain is only increasing as AI agents integrate with more APIs in dynamic, non-deterministic
ways.  We are building the next generation of software to solve those problems.

We are a newly-funded company, co-founded by ex-Snyk and ex-Auth0 engineers with multiple prior startup exits.  If you&#x27;re excited about identity and security, and the opportunity to help shape the future of both the company and the technology, we&#x27;d love to hear from you!
