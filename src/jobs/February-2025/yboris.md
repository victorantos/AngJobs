*meta*: I&#x27;m again requesting that this monthly text be updated to include &quot;*4DWW*&quot; as a tag (for *Four Day Work Week*).

While there are very few companies offering this option, it would be an improvement for everyone to have more of this option available. Including it in a monthly message (only 4 extra characters!) would be a step in a better direction.
