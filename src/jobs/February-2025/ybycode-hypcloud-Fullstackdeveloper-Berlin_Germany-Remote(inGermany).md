hypcloud - Fullstack developer - Berlin, Germany - Remote (in Germany) - German speaker
hypcloud is the go-to platform for commercial real estate financing in Germany. We help real estate developers to find financing: we provide them access to a wide network of lenders matching their project and need, and the collaboration and communication tools to allow them to manage all negotiations in one place.

Our app is mainly built with Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix, Vuejs (typescript), graphql and Phoenix Liveview. We’re seeking a Fullstack Developer who is curious, collaborative, and loves sharing knowledge. You’ll be working with Phoenix and LiveView to build features on the backend, Vue.js on the frontend, and how to integrate and&#x2F;or transition between the two. Your role will involve the full software development lifecycle, from design and development to testing and deployment.

Please email your CV at jobs@hypcloud.de, with the subject line &quot;Fullstack Developer Application – [Your Name]&quot; and tell us briefly about a recent project where you used Elixir and what kind of position you&#x27;re looking for.
