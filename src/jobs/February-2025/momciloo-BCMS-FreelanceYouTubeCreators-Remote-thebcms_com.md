BCMS - Freelance YouTube Creators - Remote - Part-time&#x2F;Project-based - thebcms.com

Hi HN! I&#x27;m Momcilo Popov, co-founder of BCMS, a flexible, developer-friendly headless CMS used by developers and agencies to build highly customizable websites and applications. We’re looking for freelance YouTube content creators to help produce:

- Tutorials on using BCMS effectively (from setup to advanced features).
- General front-end web development videos aimed at educating and inspiring developers.

Our ideal creators are skilled at making clear, engaging content with a focus on real-world scenarios. Familiarity with BCMS is a plus but not required.

If you love teaching, storytelling through code, and video production, let’s talk! Please reach out at video@thebcms.com with samples of your work or channel link.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
