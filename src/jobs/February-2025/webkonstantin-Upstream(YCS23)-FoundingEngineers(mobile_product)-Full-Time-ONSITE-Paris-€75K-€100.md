We went through YC and raised a $3 million pre-seed round from amazing investors.

Upstream is a modern email client that lets teammates communicate with efficiency and ease. In a world dominated by Slack, where chit-chat never stops, we believe that teams deserve a tool that lets them create the structure and organization that make them productive.
