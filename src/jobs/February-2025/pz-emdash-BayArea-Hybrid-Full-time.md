emdash - Bay Area - Hybrid - Full-time - Senior Frontend &amp; Infra Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emdash.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emdash.io</a>

We’re looking for engineers to join our small but mighty team at emdash to build the next generation collaboration stack, starting with chat &amp; video.

This is a very early-stage opportunity, meaning you’ll have a foundational role in shaping our product, technology, and company culture.  We already have daily active customers (including ourselves) but we are just starting to scratch the surface of what emdash can be.

Founders have a long history working together and solid engineering &amp; management experience from FB, Square, Slack, and their previous startup Rimeto (acquired by Slack).

Check out what we’ve built so far at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;emdash.io" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;emdash.io</a> and help us figure out the future.
