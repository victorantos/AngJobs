Cloudist (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudist.se" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudist.se</a>) - Software Engineer (React&#x2F;Next.js&#x2F;Fullstack TypeScript) - Malmö, Sweden - Onsite&#x2F;Hybrid

Cloudist helps partners to offer Green Cloud services to their customers. The product you&#x27;d be working on would be a portal backed by an API allowing for clients to spin up VMs, provision S3-compatible storage buckets etc. Think AWS Console and API, but of course in a smaller scale.

We&#x27;re a small, boot-strapped, profitable startup with an interesting voyage ahead of us.

This is a full-time (i.e. non-contractor) position, and we require you to be able to commute into our Malmö office several days a week. You should have a permanent work permit in EU and proven experience working face-to-face in EU-based teams. I.e. we offer no work visa sponsorship.
