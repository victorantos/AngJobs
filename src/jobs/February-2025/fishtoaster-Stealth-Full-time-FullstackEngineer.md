Stealth - San Francisco, CA (hybrid: M-W-F ONSITE) - Full-time - Fullstack Engineer

We&#x27;re looking for a backend-leaning fullstack dev. Highlights:

- We&#x27;re a 5-person startup in San Francisco (hybrid: 3 days&#x2F;week in office)

- We&#x27;re working on a b2b SaaS for managing&#x2F;analyzing cloud costs for really large companies.

- The domain isn&#x27;t cool, but the complexity is fractal and the need is huge.

- Typescript&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Clickhouse currently

- Our founders are also the founders of the Duckbill Group, an AWS cost consultancy. As a result, we&#x27;ve got a great, built-in sales pipeline.

- As a result of that, we&#x27;re bottlenecked on our ability to just build the features our users clearly want.

- So we&#x27;re hiring a 4th engineer: a backend-leaning full stack dev to build and own large swaths of this thing we&#x27;re creating!

- We&#x27;re looking for someone with 5+ years of experience, though probably closer to 8-10, depending on the person and the experience.

- Comp is 175k-200k base, 0.5-0.75% equity.
