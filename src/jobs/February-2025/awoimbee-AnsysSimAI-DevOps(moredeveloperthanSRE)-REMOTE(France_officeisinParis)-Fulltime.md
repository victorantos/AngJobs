Ansys SimAI - DevOps (more developer than SRE) - REMOTE (France, office is in Paris) - Full time

We&#x27;re building products to predict the results of numerical simulation and act on them.
Since joining the Ansys portfolio we are experiencing more demand than ever and we need help to transform a good product and infra into something truly great.

At SimAI we lightly use AWS and heavily depend on Kubernetes, both being 100% configured through Infrastructure as Code (a bit of terraform and a lot of pulumi). 
You will mostly work with Typescript (pulumi), Python (scripts and application code), Bash (scripts).

As a DevOps at SimAI you will work with me on exciting subjects like moving the compute closer to the customer, you will also work on improving our security posture and help secure more certifications for our platform.
As part of my job at SimAI I personally maintain &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Trow-Registry&#x2F;trow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Trow-Registry&#x2F;trow</a>&gt;.
