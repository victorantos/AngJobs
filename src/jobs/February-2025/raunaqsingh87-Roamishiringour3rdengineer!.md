Roam is hiring our 3rd engineer!

Housing affordability is the #1 economic issue in the US, and Roam is the solution. Last month, more than 100,000 buyers searched for their forever home on Roam in a low inventory and high rates climate.

Weâ€™re launching several products in the coming months to support our accelerating growth, including 12 new markets and the ability to afford $150k more than anywhere else on your next home purchase with Roam.

Insiders have tripled down on the company.

If you&#x27;re high-agency and want to be part of a small team of people who will save customers more than $1 billion this year - email raunaq@withroam.com
