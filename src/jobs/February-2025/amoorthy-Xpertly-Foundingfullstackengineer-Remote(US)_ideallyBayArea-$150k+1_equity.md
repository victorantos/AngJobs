Xpertly - Founding fullstack engineer - Remote (US), ideally Bay Area - $150k + 1% equity

Seed-stage company, backed by top-tier investors. CTO is former YC co-founder.

Founders previously built and sold startup so fewer dumb mistakes this time around (i.e. smarter about when to invest, such as in this hire!)

You: 5 years backend&#x2F;fullstack experience at Series A&#x2F;B company

Stack: Vue&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;AWS-lambda. Use of vector DBs&#x2F;AI where it makes sense.

Why join? CTO is one of the smartest and nicest engineers to work with and learn from. We are building something enduring and useful, both for our customers and the world at large.

ps: we&#x27;re somewhat in stealth so not much info on our socials yet about the company&#x2F;mission etc.
