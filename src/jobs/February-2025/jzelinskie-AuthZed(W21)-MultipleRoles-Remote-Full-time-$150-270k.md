AuthZed (W21) - Multiple Roles - Remote - Full-time - $150-270k

AuthZed Cloud is fully-managed, database-as-a-service platform built to be the foundation for authorization across product suites and oceans. At the core of AuthZed Cloud is SpiceDB, the premier open source database designed specifically to store and query access control data.

For years, there have been libraries to help developers build authorization systems, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped broken access control from becoming a substantial threat to the internet. The core hypothesis behind SpiceDB is that the best foundation for authorization systems is one that is centralized rather implemented ad-hoc in each application. By providing a system that is designed to be ran by a platform team centrally for an entire organization, developers can standardize workflows, testing flows, and how to interoperate between their applications.
