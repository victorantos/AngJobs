Edgeless Systems - Software Engineer - Confidential Computing and AI - REMOTE (EU) - Office in Berlin &amp; Bochum (GER) - Full-time

We are a team of ~20 people, building open source software to make confidential computing more usable. To achieve this we have built multiple products, most of which you can find on our Github page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;edgelesssys&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;edgelesssys&#x2F;</a>). You won&#x27;t find our AI product there, best way to learn about it are the docs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.privatemode.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.privatemode.ai&#x2F;</a>).

Our products span unusually far across the tech stack, starting at measured boot, through Kubernetes operators, finishing somewhere in our JavaScript frontend. We don&#x27;t expect you to do all of it - these are just possibilities.

Tech stack: Go (mostly), Rust (some), JavaScript (some), Nix &#x2F; NixOS, Kubernetes, Terraform, vLLM, AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX.
