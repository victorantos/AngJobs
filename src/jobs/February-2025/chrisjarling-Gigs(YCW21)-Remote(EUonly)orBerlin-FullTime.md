Gigs (YC W21) - Senior Fullstack Engineer (Connect&#x2F;Automations), Senior Backend Engineer - Remote (EU only) or Berlin - Full Time

At Gigs, we&#x27;re building for SIM Cards what Stripe built for payments.
If you enjoy working on challenging problems in a space that has a lot of room for new ideas and abstracting complexity, this is your spot.

Gigs has recently raised a $73M Series B round lead by Ribbit Capital. We&#x27;re looking to grow our A+ team (ex. Soundcloud, Stripe, Apple, Airbnb) to build our vision of providing phone and data plans though an API, globally.

Stack: RoR, Go (Backend), TypeScript, React, Next.js (Frontend)
