Open edX &#x2F; OpenCraft - Full-time - TRUE REMOTE (async&#x2F;worldwide) - Senior Open Source Developer on Open edX - React, Python&#x2F;Django, AWS&#x2F;Kubernetes

Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge? We do too! :)

Open-source

We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an open-first environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums.

We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.

Remote-first

Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)

We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.

Online education

We are one of the main contributors to the Open edX project, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like edX.org, the MIT Open Learning Library, and the national online learning platform for France. We provide development and hosting for institutions like Harvard Medical School, Harvard LabXchange, Cloudera, Autodesk, and several governments. We are not affiliated with edX.org, but we contribute and work with them on various projects.

Our handbook, like much of our work, is publicly viewable and you can find it at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handbook.opencraft.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handbook.opencraft.com&#x2F;</a>.
