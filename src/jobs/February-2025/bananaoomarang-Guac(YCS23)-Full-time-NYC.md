Guac (YC S23) - Senior Data&#x2F;Solutions Engineer - Full-time - NYC

At Guac, we&#x27;re on a mission to solve grocery food waste with predictive ML. We forecast exactly how much of each product will sell, to put an end to the millions of tons of food that goes to waste every single day due to bad inventory replenishment.

We&#x27;re currently working with major supermarket chains in the US (you&#x27;ve probably shopped at some of them before), and we&#x27;re backed by Y Combinator, 1984 Ventures, Collaborative Fund, and angels from Instacart and Citadel Securities.

This position will include a 50&#x2F;50 mix of customer facing, forward deployed work as well as development of our ETL pipelines and APIs. We are a still a small team and there is huge opportunity to get involved across the company and take ownership of key parts of our stack.

Responsibilities:

* Collaborating directly with customers&#x27; technical teams to understand their IT infrastructure and system implementations

* Working with customersâ€™ internal supply chain and store operations teams to understand and then implement their unique business logic

* Designing and implementing scalable data pipelines for processing large-scale data across multiple customers

* Contributing to our backend services to serve our mobile and web applications

Key technologies: Python, FastAPI, Dagster, GCP (including BigQuery), Dask, and SQL.
