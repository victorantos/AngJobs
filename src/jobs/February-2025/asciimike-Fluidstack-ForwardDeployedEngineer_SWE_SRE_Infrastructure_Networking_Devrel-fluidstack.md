Fluidstack - Forward Deployed Engineer, SWE, SRE, Infrastructure, Networking, Devrel - London&#x2F;SF&#x2F;NYC or remote - fluidstack.io
Fluidstack builds and operates GPU supercomputers for top AI labs, governments, and enterprises. Our customers include Mistral, Poolside, Black Forest Labs, Meta, and more.

Engineers at Fluidstack work on a wide variety of activities, including:

- Deploying clusters of 1,000+ GPUs and operating them with and for customers.

- Validating correctness and performance of underlying compute, storage, and networking infrastructure, and working with providers to optimize these subsystems.

- Migrating petabytes of data from public cloud platforms to local storage, as quickly and cost effectively as possible.

- Debugging issues anywhere in the stack, from “this server’s fan is blocked by a plastic bag” to “optimizing S3 dataloaders from buckets in different regions”.

- Building internal tooling to decrease deployment time and increase cluster reliability, including automation where the customer benefits clearly outweigh the implementation overhead.

We don&#x27;t require prior experience with GPUs or AI&#x2F;ML; we require a willingness to learn quickly, work hard, and obsess about customer success.
