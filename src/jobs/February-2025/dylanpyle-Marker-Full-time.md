Marker - Full-time - Remote or Hybrid (NYC&#x2F;SF) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markercollective.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markercollective.com</a>

Marker is a new technology joint venture from 3 leading communications agencies. We’re an incubator building and launching force-multiplying software products for our clients and teams.

Our first product is Delve (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delve.news" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delve.news</a>) — a coverage monitoring, analysis, and insight toolkit to track and measure the entire online conversation about your business or industry.

Our product team is small and autonomous, but with the resources, expertise, and customer access of the global agencies we work with. We’re hiring an early engineer to join us on this journey; you’ll have a large impact on what we build, how we build it, and where we’re going next.

Our current technology stack includes Deno, React, and PostgreSQL. Bonus points for expertise in one or more of: distributed systems, RAG, web scraping, data visualization.
