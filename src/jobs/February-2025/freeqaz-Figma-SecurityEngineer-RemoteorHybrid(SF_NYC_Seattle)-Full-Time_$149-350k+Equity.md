Figma - Security Engineer - Remote or Hybrid (SF, NYC, Seattle) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;figma.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;figma.com</a> - Full-Time, $149-350k + Equity

Figma makes the tools that modern companies use to design apps. And because of that highly sensitive data, security is extremely important to get right. (If the next iPhone were designed using Figma and a breach leaked it... yeah, you get the point.)

Anyway, I am on the security team over here at Figma and reminding the excellent HN folks that we&#x27;re hiring. I&#x27;m primarily working on AI and Snowflake Security currently, but I&#x27;ve hopped around over the past year. You likely will too!

We are a bit of a weird hybrid hiring-wise though. We need engineers with a security background than can _also_ write production-grade software.

(If you are a regular SWE then please check out Figma Careers page for a better role to apply for. There are many open roles, though keep in mind that Figma tends to only hire at the &quot;Senior&quot; bar and up. Not very many junior folks here.)

This is the link for my team if you&#x27;re interested! Feel free to ping me at my email on my profile if you have questions. Cheers!
