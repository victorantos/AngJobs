expand.ai (YC S24) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.expand.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.expand.ai</a> - Backend, ML - Onsite in San Francisco

At expand.ai, we turn the internet into a database. We are doing bleeding edge web agent research.

We&#x27;re hiring a founding engineer.

We care less about your particular background, be it AI, ML, backend, full-stack...
What we care about is that you&#x27;re passionate about programming.
We are solving technically very hard problems. See more in the role description.

Given that I&#x27;m a solo founder, we can afford giving you a bit more equity than most startups ;)
