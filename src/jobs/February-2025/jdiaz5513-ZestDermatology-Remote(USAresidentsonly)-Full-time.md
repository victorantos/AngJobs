Zest Dermatology - Remote (USA residents only) - Full-time - Systems Administrator &#x2F; Software Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zesthealth.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zesthealth.com</a>

Zest is a virtual dermatology clinic that delivers care for chronic eczema and psoriasis with a level of satisfaction and patient outcomes that are unheard of in conventional dermatology. What makes Zest particularly exciting is its value-based health care business model, a topic worth researching all on its own!

We are looking to add an experienced Linux and web application wizard to our small and agile core engineering team. As part of the core team you will work across and become familiar with the entire stack, and the focus will be on maintaining the AWS infrastructre (orchestrated in Terraform). If you are excited at all by the idea of using nix in a professional environment, you are very strongly encouraged to apply. (We&#x27;re also not 100% married to it and will make pragmatic decisions when necessary ;).)

You&#x27;ll be working with me directly, and joining at at time where your voice will be extremely infuential to the future of engineering at the business. We have an _engineering-first_ approach to IT that should be a breath of fresh air to any veteran of the IT scene!

Because of data export restrictions and access to protected health records, all applicants must reside full time in the US. Please send a resume and cover letter directly to me: hn-hiring [at] [website domain] and make sure to mention HN in the subject line.
