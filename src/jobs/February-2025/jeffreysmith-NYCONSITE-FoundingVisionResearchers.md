We&#x27;re a stealth mode genAI startup working to advance the state-of-the-art in visual reasoning and image generation.

The roles we&#x27;re hiring for are at the boundary of fundamental and applied research on visual reasoning and image generation. Ideal candidates will have previous research experience in the CV&#x2F;image generation domain, ideally with publications and&#x2F;or open source artifacts of this work.
