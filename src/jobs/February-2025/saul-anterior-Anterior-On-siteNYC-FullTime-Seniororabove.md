Anterior is improving the experience of healthcare for everyone. We&#x27;re working on the cutting edge of using technology to make clinical decisioning frictionless, starting with prior authorization.

We&#x27;re growing fast and need all the help we can get! We&#x27;re building exciting tech for huge customers and we trust in the foundations: keep it simple, build strong foundations and the rest will follow.

About You: You have a passion for doing things The Right Way, you believe Less is More, you want to focus on Foundations of system design and architecture (pacelc, consistency guarantees), you care as much about the code you do not write, you’re tired of the hype treadmill and care about the fundamentals. You have battle scars from overengineered and underperforming slop, and you care about writing code that lasts.

- Langs: Python &#x2F; Go &#x2F; TS, React (and HTMX if you can help!)

- Infra: Nix, CDKTF, AWS

We’re hiring from infra to frontend, there is room all the way up and down the stack. Come share your proudest firefighting story with us in an interview, bring your GitHub, and let’s see if we’re a good fit. (If you&#x27;re a junior passionate about coding and hacking: it&#x27;s always ok to apply, shoot us a link to some of your work and let&#x27;s talk anyway)
