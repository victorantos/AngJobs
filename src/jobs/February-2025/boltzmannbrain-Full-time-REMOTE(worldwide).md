Pasteur Labs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pasteurlabs.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pasteurlabs.ai</a>) - Full-time - REMOTE (worldwide) - DevOps &#x2F; MLOps &#x2F; full-stack &#x2F; platform &#x2F; MLEng

At Pasteur Labs, we develop computing technologies that enable scientific and industrial challenges to be approached in new ways: that is, a first of its kind AI-native, developer-first platform for modeling &amp; simulation (M&amp;S). Our product aim is to enable in-silico playgrounds for human-machine teams experimenting and building in industrial R&amp;D, energy security, &amp; advanced manufacturing arenas. As a public-benefit for-profit startup, our mission is Nobel-Turing [1] technologies to advance science and society for all humankind. With venture funding and Fortune500 customers (+dozens more on the waitlist), we’re looking for ambitious, intellectually curious software engineers that can consistently contribute in non-trivial, impressive ways as we ship and scale our flagship product platform — some call it “live intelligent digital twins” and others say “cyberphysical testbeds for AGI”, while most view Pasteur Labs product catalogue as “Databricks for industrial R&amp;D”.

In particular, we are seeking experienced DevOps &#x2F; MLOps teammates that can build from day 1 with Go, Python, containerization, and our multiple cloud setups (Azure, Google (GCP), Oracle Cloud (OCI)), and on-prem infrastructure for mixed GPU &amp; CPU workloads — if you&#x27;ve done this before with CAE simulation systems and scientific datasets, reach out and say so!

Our team is largely made of industry-hardened research-software engineering experts [2], whom thrive in interdisciplinary and fast-paced teams—from NASA to Nvidia, Deepmind to Oracle, CERN to Cerebras, SpaceX to Autodesk, the Navy, Air Force, and on. With HQ in Brooklyn NY [3], and satellite offices opening in Copenhagen + London + Vancouver in 2025, we are an internationally distributed team running remote full-time — from San Francisco to Sao Paulo to Stockholm and everywhere in-between. The full team gathers multiple times per year for 1-week Pasteur Labs “onsites”—recently in Miami, Amsterdam, Cambridge, and more.
