Stanford Research Computing - Stanford, CA (next to Palo Alto) - Full-time - Two positions - HYBRID

Stanford Research Computing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu</a>) is a collaboration between University IT and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. We operate HPC environments for researchers, we do one-time consultations on projects (from software and pipelines, to data management, to physical building design and fit-out), and we provide contract support for individual Labs, Departments, and Schools.

We have two open positions:

• GPU Cluster Sysadmin: With Marlowe—our 1SU NVIDIA DGX H100 SuperPOD with DDN Intelliflash and DDN NFS storage—launched, we have decided to hire an additional sysadmin! You&#x27;ll be working with the latest AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;Deep Learning&#x2F;LLM software &amp; frameworks, getting them to work in an HPC environment. You&#x27;ll be keeping the environment up-to-date, and working with NVIDIA&#x2F;DDN when there&#x27;s trouble. You should also expect to interact with users &amp; PIs a lot. More info: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD8mESql" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD8mESql</a> (or, if you&#x27;re very experienced in the field, go to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDrWNSqm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDrWNSqm</a>).

• Research Computing Systems Engineer: We run lots of different compute environments.  Some of them have to deal with HIPAA data, which presents unique challenges, and so we are hiring an additional sysadmin!  You should already have experience with Linux system administration; as well as the necessary networking, storage, and configuration management skills needed to bring up a compute environment.  Ideally you will also have experience with job schedulers (SLURM, LSF, etc.) and the peculiarities of working with the requirements for managing data under HIPAA.

If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you drive, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site. There is some on-call around the holidays. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation). All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards</a>.
