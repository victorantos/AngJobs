Go-ethereum - Berlin, Boulder, Remote - Full-time - Staff Software Engineer

Geth (go-ethereum) is an Ethereum execution client written in Go. It underpins the Ethereum protocol and many other projects around it. The team is seeking an individual contributor who likes working on a large and well-established production codebase. We value individuals who are able to think on their own, see complex projects from start to finish without intervention, and are able to jump into whatever is necessary in the project.

The Geth team is decentralized with members in the USA, across Europe, and in China. As such, fully remote work is possible. We have a slight preference toward hiring in Boulder (Colorado) or Berlin (Germany) since Ethereum Foundation has offices there.

Geth resides within the Ethereum Foundation. The EF is a global non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies. Our mission is to do what is best for Ethereumâ€™s long-term success. Our role is to allocate resources to critical projects, to be a valued voice within the Ethereum ecosystem, and to advocate for Ethereum to the outside world.
