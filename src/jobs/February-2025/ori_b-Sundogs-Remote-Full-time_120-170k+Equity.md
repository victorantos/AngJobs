Sundogs is a startup in the advertising space; we make video ads perform better by giving marketers tools to measure and improve their creative effectiveness. Our team is a global collection of Cannes-winning creatives, ex-Googlers, cutting edge data scientists, and start-up entrepreneurs, and we&#x27;re poking at the future with curiosity and delight.

We are looking for a curious and versatile AI engineer, with strong analytics &amp; data science skills combined with software engineering skills (Python), to join our team and help build our core product.

If you are someone who is keen to learn about the world of video creative and loves to solve “Left Brain-Right brain” types of problems, bridging together human complex notions with advanced tech, this role is for you!

You will be primarily interacting with non technical stakeholders and we expect impeccable communication skills and the ability to make complex technical concepts accessible to everyone with simple words.

This role bridges prompt engineering and traditional data analysis.

Prior experience in advertising is strongly preferred.

Qualifications:

* At ease with writing production Python code

* Experience in analytics, data interpretation, exploration, and visualization

* Experience in data science, including data cleaning, preparation, feature engineering, and modelling

* Experience in SQL
