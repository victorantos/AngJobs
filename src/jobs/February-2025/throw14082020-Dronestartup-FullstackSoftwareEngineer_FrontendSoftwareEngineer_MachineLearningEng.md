Drone startup - Fullstack Software Engineer, Frontend Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Mechanical Design Engineer - 2 days&#x2F;week in the office (London, UK) - Citizens of the UNITED KINGDOM only

You&#x27;d be working with engineers who previously worked at Google, Amazon, Helsing, Darktrace and an F1 team. We build drones (software and hardware)

We&#x27;re looking for engineers that straddle real world problems, and use technology as a solution. We prefer personal projects or relevant hobbies, not hard leetcode questions. We value collaboration: pair programming, discussing, teaching and learning from others. We&#x27;re looking for mission-driven engineers. People who see problems in the world and want to help solve them.

You&#x27;d be working with me to build the most intuitive, performant, and modern mission planning and flight monitoring software for drones, and related applications (tools for drone design and manufacturing). For my project, we use React, Tailwind, Node, drizzle-orm, Postgres, SQLite, deck.gl, Python, FastAPI, asyncio, and more. You&#x27;re allowed (and compensated) to use AI services.

If interested, email my temporary email: hn-feb25@mail.orth.uk. Temporary only because of spam emails (not related to hiring).
