Mondrio - Software Engineer (Founding Team) - REMOTE (Brazil) - 3-Month Trial-to-Hire

B2B SaaS pricing is still guesswork. We’re building the AI-powered monetization operating system to fix it. We are pre-seed, lean (4 people), and shipping to live customers.

The Experience: This is a unique &quot;fast-track&quot; for an ambitious junior&#x2F;mid-level engineer. You’ll skip the corporate ladder and learn to build an AI-native company from the ground floor. You will own features end-to-end—no managers, no layers.

AI-Native Workflow: We are all-in on Claude Code for scoping and shipping. You get a seat on Day 1. If you aren&#x27;t already 10x-ing your output with AI tools, we’ll teach you. It’s the most essential skill for the next decade of engineering.

The Work:

Integrations: Build OAuth 2.0 flows and data sync pipelines for pilot customers.

Northstar Module: Build a strategic intelligence module from scratch (DB, Backend, Frontend integration. We have most of designs already).

AI Personas: Use LLMs to turn raw customer data into actionable pricing strategy.

Stack: Python 3.12 (Typed), FastAPI, MongoDB&#x2F;Beanie, React&#x2F;TS, Gemini&#x2F;Claude, Claude Code, Google Cloud, Docker, Pulumi

Who You Are: You write clean, typed Python and can navigate a React component. You use AI tools (Cursor&#x2F;Copilot) to move fast but remain the pilot. You care about the &quot;Why&quot; behind the product.

Process: Intro call → Technical session → Founder chat. Decision in ~7 days.
