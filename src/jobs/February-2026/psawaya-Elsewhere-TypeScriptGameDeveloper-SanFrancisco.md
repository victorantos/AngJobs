Elsewhere - TypeScript Game Developer - San Francisco

Ever wanted to build indie video games at a startup? Let&#x27;s talk.
Elsewhere is a San Francisco-based company building a new kind of multiplayer social video game, inspired by indie roguelike deckbuilding games like Slay the Spire and CCGs like Magic: The Gathering.
We&#x27;re using generative AI in a creatively interesting way to build the first AI game that doesn&#x27;t suck.
We&#x27;re backed by top Silicon Valley investors, and graduated from the first cohort of a16z&#x27;s SPEEDRUN program, which is kind of like YC for games.

Ideally, you:

* Have worked as a software engineer before, ideally on a small team.
* Have built and shipped games before, either professionally or on your own time.
* Have experience with full-stack web development, using TypeScript, React, etc.
* Love games yourself, and have always wanted to work in the games industry.
