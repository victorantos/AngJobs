 • Write clear product requirements and acceptance criteria
 • Partner with engineering, QA, and support to deliver high-quality releases
 • Use product metrics and user behavior to guide iteration
 • Represent the voice of the user, with empathy for people with hearing challenges

Requirements:
 • Experience as a Product Manager on a mobile app
 • Strong communication and organization skills
 • Comfortable working with engineers on technical topics (APIs, data models, tradeoffs)
