Small boutique consulting - Remote (US) (some est meetings) - part-time&#x2F;flexible&#x2F;1099

Hi! I work with a small group of developers doing custom software development and consulting for small&#x2F;medium businesses.

We are seeking a developery-data person with experience specifically with CloudSuite Distribution by Infor for one of our clients. It may be a bit of a shot in the dark, but if you have worked with this *specific* ERP system before, we&#x27;d be eager to talk to you. Reach out at &quot;ekib.eikooc@rofni&quot;.reverse() Please include your experience in your email body&#x2F;subject as we will have to quickly triage out most of the spam.

PS. Each time I post here I get ~500 emails, almost all are low effort that don&#x27;t meet anything I am looking for, sometimes for months in the future. I expect it to be even worse as LLMs gain traction. I&#x27;ve hired 4 people from past posts (check my history if you want!), but it can take some time dig through everyone so I apologize to legitimate interests.
