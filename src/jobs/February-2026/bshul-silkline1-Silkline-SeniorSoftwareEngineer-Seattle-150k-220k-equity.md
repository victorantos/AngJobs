Modern hardware supply chains run on spreadsheets, email, and PDFs. It&#x27;s like fax woke up in 2025. We&#x27;re fixing this with an AI-first procurement platform for aerospace, defense, and nuclear manufacturing.

Our customers: Machina Labs, Astranis, K2 Space, Castelion, Antares, and more. They use us to manage suppliers, track $M+ in orders, automate RFQs, and stay ITAR-compliant. Every day of production delay costs $50k+—our platform keeps them moving.

The role: Own features end-to-end, build ERP integrations that sync POs and manufacturing data, real-time order tracking dashboards, and a user experience that people LOVE. Work directly with customers whose supply chains depend on what you ship.

Stack: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Hasura (GraphQL), PostgreSQL, Trigger.dev, AWS GovCloud, Pulumi, Elbow grease.

You: 5+ years shipping production systems, strong full-stack or frontend generalist who moves fast, thrive on customer feedback and direct impact, bonus: ERP integrations, B2B SaaS, or regulated industries

Traction: 5x&#x27;d customer count last year, $5M funding to date, landing massive defense&#x2F;space logos. Small team shipping incredibly fast—you&#x27;ll work directly with our founders (Isaac and myself).
