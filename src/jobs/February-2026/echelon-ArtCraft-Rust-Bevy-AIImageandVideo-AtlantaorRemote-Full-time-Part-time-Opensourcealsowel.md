ArtCraft - Rust, Bevy, AI Image and Video - Atlanta or Remote - Full-time, Part-time, Open source also welcome

We&#x27;re building an open source AI image and video crafting tool, aiming to take on the likes of Adobe, Figma, Blender, and more.

The tool is similar to AI aggregator tools like FreePik, Higgsfield, etc., but we&#x27;re making our tools open source and we undercut middle-men aggregators with strong BYOK &#x2F; &quot;login with&quot; components. Our founding team consists of filmmakers, VFX engineers, and people passionate about the field.

To apply: email brandon@storyteller.ai or join our Discord. Mention HN. Strong bias for candidates that enjoy film and video, so please share your YouTube, Vimeo, or IMDB if you have one.
