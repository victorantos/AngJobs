Vidably - Founding Engineers and Designer - San Francisco (SF) - Full-time - Onsite

(I only have one JD posted publicly, but I&#x27;m hiring broadly for eng + design): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view&#x2F;4330646312" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;view&#x2F;4330646312</a>

I&#x27;m founder of Vidably and just closed a $1.5M pre-seed last week.

AI agents are about to orchestrate trillions in commerce, but today they shop on thin data: product specs, studio photos, and text reviews. Agents need evidence, not marketing. Today, the most influential product evidence lives on TikTok and Reels, outside the surfaces brands control and agents can use. Vidably puts verified buyer video directly onto e-commerce product pages through a lightweight widget. We capture that video post-purchase and link it to real purchasing outcomes. Every video is SKU-linked and structured so shopping agents can reason over it.

We&#x27;re already seeing organic pull from creators and expansion from brands.
