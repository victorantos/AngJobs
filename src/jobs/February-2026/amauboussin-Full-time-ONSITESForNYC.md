Our mission at Surge is to build the human infrastructure behind the next generation of models. We operate the largest human data platform in the industry and power the AI teams at all of the top AI labs. This year, we&#x27;re been focusing on RL environments and agentic workflows to help our clients ship agents that interact with the world. Here are some examples of our past work:

You’d be joining a rapidly growing team of former founders, engineering leaders and AI researchers from Google, Meta, Twitter, and Airbnb. We work in small groups, ship quickly, and value autonomy and ownership. No previous AI experience is required, if you have the engineering skills you can learn what you need on the job.

We&#x27;re looking for senior engineers to work out of our offices in SF or NYC, or remotely. Please reach out to us at careers@surgehq.ai with a resume and 2-3 sentences describing your interest. Excited to hear from you!
