Fanvue - AI Internal Developer Tooling Engineer - REMOTE (London based, GMT-5 to GMT+5 preferred) - Full-time

One of the coolest roles we&#x27;ve had: experiment with cutting-edge AI tools to make talented engineers faster and more effective. Hands-on, experimental, operating at the frontier.

Fanvue is a fast-growing creator monetisation platform — AI-powered, creator-first (Series A, $100M+ ARR, triple-digit YoY growth), supporting hundreds of thousands of creators and millions of fans.

What you&#x27;ll do: Define and roll out our AI-assisted dev stack (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) across IDEs, PR workflows, and CI. Build MCP servers and AI-ready infra for context-aware code generation. Enable parallelised workflows, agent skills, and AI-assisted reviews. Establish best practices for safe, consistent AI-assisted coding. Track and report measurable impact. Evaluate emerging tools with clear success criteria.

Who you are: Strong software engineering background with TypeScript in production. Hands-on with AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, Copilot). Experience with MCP servers. Solid LLM fundamentals (RAG, embeddings, fine-tuning). Comfortable with GitHub workflows and CI&#x2F;CD. Autonomous, experimental, outcome-focused.

You&#x27;ll thrive if you want to make engineers dramatically more effective, enjoy rapid experimentation, and own outcomes. You&#x27;ll struggle if you prefer fixed roadmaps or need heavy direction.

Why Fanvue: Define responsible AI at scale, direct impact on velocity and quality, access to top AI tools, competitive salary, unlimited holiday, remote-first, flexible hours.
