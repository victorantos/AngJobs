Kadoa - Multiple roles - Remote - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com</a>

Web scraping hasn&#x27;t changed in decades: engineers still write brittle scripts that constantly break. Kadoa automates the entire web data pipeline with AI agents that build, maintain, and validate scraper code themselves.

All 3 founders have spent years in the trenches writing web scraping and ETL software and still do it almost every single day. We’re making sure every team member can do the best work of their career at Kadoa.

We are growing fast, have a drama-free and distraction-light environment, and try to minimize the distance between the code you ship and the customers who use it.

We are looking for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship, web scraping, and AI.

Open roles:

- Senior Frontend Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;frontend-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;frontend-engineer</a>
