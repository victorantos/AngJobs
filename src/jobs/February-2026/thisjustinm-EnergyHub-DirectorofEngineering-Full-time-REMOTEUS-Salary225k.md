Want to work on helping to decarbonize the electric grid and transportation in the US? (the two biggest sectors for impact)

Want to do it at scale? (we control over 2.5 million devices across the US making up over 4 gigawatts of electrical load for utilities that service 1&#x2F;3rd of the entire US population)

Come work with me building some of the largest VPPs (virtual power plants) on the planet at EnergyHub. (What&#x27;s a VPP? See page two of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;live-energy-hub.pantheonsite.io&#x2F;app&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2026&#x2F;01&#x2F;DOE-LPO-VPP-Liftoff-2025-update.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;live-energy-hub.pantheonsite.io&#x2F;app&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2026&#x2F;01&#x2F;...</a> )

EnergyHub’s software makes it easy for millions of smart device owners to partner with their utility and help decarbonize the grid. Our platform lets consumers turn their smart thermostats, electric cars, EV chargers, batteries, and other products into virtual power plants that keep the grid stable and enable higher utilization of solar and wind power. You’ll be a part of building the tech that’s at the center of it all.

Tech stack includes: Java, Kotlin, React, Snowflake, dbt, AWS, Docker, Python, PostgreSQL

All roles are remote but if you like offices we have them in Brooklyn, NY and Burlington, VT.

Note that we can NOT sponsor visas at this time.
