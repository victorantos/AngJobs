Beacon AI builds intelligent systems that make aviation safer and more autonomous. We’ve completed multiple DoD programs and are expanding our team with exceptional technical leaders to push the boundaries of human-machine collaboration in the cockpit.

You’ll help shape critical systems that advance aviation safety and autonomy, working alongside a team that values effort, creativity, and accountability.

We’re hiring Lead Engineers with 5-9 YOE who love solving complex problems. At Beacon, you’ll own your work end-to-end, from prototype to deployment, and literally see your code take flight in real world aviation environments! Roles:
