Zoox - Full Stack Software Engineer - Bay Area - Hybrid (3 days)

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;zoox&#x2F;d4a324c6-8186-435f-a102-1ac7a69abe1e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;zoox&#x2F;d4a324c6-8186-435f-a102-1ac7a69ab...</a>

I&#x27;m an engineer on the HD Mapping Team at Zoox (autonomous vehicles) and we are looking for a mid-career full stack engineer with a flair for automation and dev tooling. The role is about helping us scale our map production and management systems. Geospatial data and 3D visualization (deck.gl) experience are nice to haves but by no means required.

If the role sounds like a good fit and you would like to talk to someone directly you can email me at carl chatfield gmail. (Please fill in the gaps).

Usual perks apply, but please read the linked job description for details.

Thank you :)
