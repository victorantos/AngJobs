Pushscroll - Full-Stack Mobile Engineer (KMP) - REMOTE (GMT-3 to GMT+4)

We make people do push-ups before opening addictive apps - verified through camera pose detection. Our goal is to replace doomscrolling with exercise.

500k+ downloads, bootstrapped and profitable, very quickly growing.

Looking for someone strong in Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform + Swift&#x2F;SwiftUI who works independently, uses AI to ship fast, and can implement a pixel-perfect Figma design.

Bonus: Supabase, Amplitude, native Android&#x2F;iOS knowledge (e.g., Screen Time).

Small team, work directly with founders, long-term role. We’ve got big plans to make Pushscroll the app of the year, and there are a lot of challenging problems to get there.
