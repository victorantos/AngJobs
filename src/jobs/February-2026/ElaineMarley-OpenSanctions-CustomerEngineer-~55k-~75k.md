OpenSanctions builds an open source database of sanctioned entities, PEPs, and other risk-relevant subjects used in compliance screening and investigations.

We’re hiring a Customer Engineer to bridge customers and engineering. You’ll help customers integrate our API and bulk data, reproduce and debug issues, write clear technical guidance and examples, and turn recurring customer pain into product and docs improvements.

Required: strong customer-facing communication with technical users, comfortable with APIs and JSON, can write small scripts (Python preferred, JS ok), comfortable with Docker and basic infra troubleshooting (logs, configs, ports), fluent English, overlap with CET working hours (ideally CET ±3).

Nice to have: fuzzy matching or entity resolution experience, interest in sanctions and AML&#x2F;KYC or OSINT, comfort with support tooling and building clean escalation paths.
