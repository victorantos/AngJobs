Waypoint AI - Senior Backend, Fullstack, Frontend - Prague + REMOTE (CZ) - Full-time - Equity

We&#x27;re building Chip — an AI support engineer that autonomously triages, routes, and resolves complex technical support cases. Think: a teammate that reads every Jira ticket, every Intercom thread, and every runbook, then actually acts on them.

Czech-American B2B startup, raised $3.1M. Already in production with Volvo, ClickHouse, and others.

We&#x27;re a small eng team where early architectural decisions still matter. We use AI daily as a collaborator (Claude Code) — not as a gimmick, but because it genuinely makes us faster. We value craft, ownership, and shipping in small slices.

Stack: Django + Django Ninja, Postgres, Dramatiq (background jobs), React&#x2F;Next.js&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;Tailwind.

Hiring for three roles:

Senior Backend Engineer (AI Systems) — Own APIs, data pipelines, and durable workflows. LLM product experience (evals, cost&#x2F;latency, vector search) is a plus. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mywaypoint.ai&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;senior-backend-engineer-ai-systems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mywaypoint.ai&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;senior-backend-engineer...</a>

Fullstack Engineer — Backend-heavy with enough frontend to be dangerous. End-to-end ownership from schema to UI. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mywaypoint.ai&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;fullstack-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mywaypoint.ai&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;fullstack-engineer</a>

Frontend Developer — Build interfaces that make complex AI feel simple. React&#x2F;Next.js&#x2F;TS&#x2F;Tailwind. Product-minded, not just pixel-pushing. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mywaypoint.ai&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;frontend-developer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mywaypoint.ai&#x2F;open-positions&#x2F;frontend-developer</a>

Office in Prague 7 (Holešovice), remote-friendly. Competitive CZ-market comp + meaningful equity.

To apply: joinus@mywaypoint.ai — include a project you shipped end-to-end and how you use AI tooling in your workflow. Mention HN.
