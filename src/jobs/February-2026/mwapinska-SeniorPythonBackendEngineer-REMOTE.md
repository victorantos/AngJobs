Senior Python Backend Engineer - REMOTE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reef-technologies.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reef-technologies.com&#x2F;</a>

We’re looking for Python backend engineers to work on a trustless supercluster of performance-proofed GPU-enabled sandboxed docker container runners controlled by truly decentralized algorithms (not just PAXOS or RAFT).

Wow, that was a mouthful...

If you found it interesting, join Reef Technologies and tackle complex technical challenges like this on your own terms:

- Contribute from wherever you like—we are fully remote

- Set your own time commitment, as long as it’s at least 30h per week

- See how we work in our handbook: github.com&#x2F;reef-technologies&#x2F;handbook

- Influence the way we operate through our Sociocracy 3.0 decision-making process

Salary on a B2B contract:

- 45-70 USD or 180-280 PLN per hour

- Flexible work schedule (as measured with a time tracker)

- We automatically adjust rates based on inflation twice a year

We&#x27;re looking for someone with 5+ years of programming experience, including at least a year with Python (including opensource and significant personal projects).

So, what do you think? You don&#x27;t even need a CV, just go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.reef.pl&#x2F;?utm_source=hackernews" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.reef.pl&#x2F;?utm_source=hackernews</a> and shoot a few quick commands to apply.
