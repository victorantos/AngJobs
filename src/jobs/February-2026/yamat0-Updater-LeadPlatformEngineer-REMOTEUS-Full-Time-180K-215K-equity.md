We&#x27;re hiring a Lead Platform Engineer who will split their time 50&#x2F;50 between hands-on technical work and cross-functional collaboration.

This is a foundational hire with significant influence over our platform direction. You&#x27;ll build the next generation of infrastructure and tooling that lets our engineers ship faster and sleep better.
