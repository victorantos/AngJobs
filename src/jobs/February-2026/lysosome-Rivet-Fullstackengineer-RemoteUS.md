Your favorite artist is on Rivet. Chance the Rapper, Major Lazer, John Legend, and more engage their fans with our AI marketing platform. We boost D2C revenue for brand and creator teams by growing their communities and powering their direct-to-fan marketing and sales across all channels.

I&#x27;m one of two founding engineers, and we&#x27;re expanding to an eng team of three. We&#x27;re looking for scrappy and adaptable fullstack devs with demonstrated early-stage startup experience. Our main web app stack includes Express &#x2F; React on Typescript, Postgres, hosted on AWS.

We&#x27;re pre-seed, VC-backed, and have gone from pre-revenue to profitable in the past 2 years.
