Northstar Security - Software Engineer - SF Bay Area - Onsite - Full-time
Northstar is a seed-stage cybersecurity startup building an agentic platform to help security teams understand and defend the complex environments they&#x27;re responsible for. Our semantic layer integrates data from the fragmented security and IT tools that teams have to deal with and allows for an AI-native approach to reasoning over a company&#x27;s security posture.

We&#x27;re looking for someone with hands on experience building modern AI systems who wants to join an early startup (&lt;5 engineers) and everything that comes with it: working closely with design partners, solving hard technical problems, working in a fast-paced environment and figuring out how to apply agentic AI in practical, novel ways.

I&#x27;m also looking for someone who&#x27;s a scrappy ui engineer&#x2F;designer hybrid - will want to see examples of interesting UIs you&#x27;ve built and how you&#x27;re using AI to accelerate the design process.

Contact me if you&#x27;re interested - alex@northstar.security
