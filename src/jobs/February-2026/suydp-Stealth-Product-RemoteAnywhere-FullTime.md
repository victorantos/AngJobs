Stealth - Product - Remote Anywhere - Full Time

Hello, I am bootstrapping an AI companion startup. I believe that within 10 years, more people will date AI than humans. I think this is neither good nor bad, just interesting, and I want to build something in this space.

- I am looking to hire someone to help with user interviews to define and iterate the MVP.
- You should have strong communication skills and be familiar with how to talk to users
- You should have C1+ English proficiency

As I am bootstrapping this, I can only offer up to $4,000&#x2F;mo ($50,000&#x2F;yr) at the moment. If you are interested, please email James at gcyiuqy1 [at] gmail.com
