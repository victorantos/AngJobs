Sent an email out just a bit ago! Please let me know if it doesn&#x27;t arrive for whatever reason.

EDIT: Looks like my comment was detached from its thread (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46857847">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46857847</a>) without a comment explaining why. It&#x27;s not breaking any of the stated rules at the top, and it seems like it would be common sense to let someone know they should expect a message (especially considering how temperamental email filtering can be these days). If this _is_ against the rules, I&#x27;d appreciate it if future hiring threads stated as such so that people like myself that have been trying to find a job for 7+ months can stop wasting our time here. I understand how it can be challenging to moderate a forum like HN, but the moderation priorities seem pretty disappointing, unfortunately.
