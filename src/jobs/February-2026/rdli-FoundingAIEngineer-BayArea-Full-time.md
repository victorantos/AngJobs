Cybersecurity&#x2F;AI seed startup - Founding AI Engineer - Bay Area - Full-time

We&#x27;re seed-staged, 3 people, building an AI for cybersecurity, looking for a founding AI engineer who wants to learn&#x2F;apply SOTA techniques for AI. Ideal background is experience building production agentic AI systems (by this I mean something like Simon&#x27;s definition: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2025&#x2F;Sep&#x2F;18&#x2F;agents&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2025&#x2F;Sep&#x2F;18&#x2F;agents&#x2F;</a> definition) who also likes to think about WHAT to build and not just how.

We are a Golang&#x2F;Python shop (although I&#x27;m not sure that matters so much any more).
