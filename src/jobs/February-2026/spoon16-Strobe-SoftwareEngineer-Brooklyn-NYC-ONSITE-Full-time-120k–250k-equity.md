Strobe - Software Engineer - Brooklyn, NYC - ONSITE - Full-time - $120k–$250k + equity

We’re building a distributed, software-defined power plant: buildings, batteries, EVs, and on-site generation buying and selling power in real time. Think cloud control plane + embedded hardware + energy markets.

Small, high-performing team. No layers. You’ll own systems end-to-end: design → deploy → on-call.

We’re looking for *fungible generalists*, not narrow specialists. Strong fit if you’re comfortable with:
- AWS-heavy backend work (Lambda, APIs, GraphQL, data pipelines)
- Operating real-time production systems
- Python &#x2F; TypeScript (Rust a plus)

Depending on fit, you might work on:
- Telemetry &amp; control over unreliable networks
- Embedded Linux &#x2F; RTUs (Modbus, BACnet, DNP3)
- Market-facing systems and optimization
- Operator UIs with real-time streams (React)

Requirements:
- Strong production experience
- Systems mindset, bias to shipping
- Willing to be onsite 5 days&#x2F;week at Newlab (Brooklyn Navy Yard)
- Not remote

Fast pace, direct feedback, real ownership. This is not a 9–5.
