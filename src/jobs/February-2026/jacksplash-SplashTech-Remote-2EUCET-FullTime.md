Splash Tech-  FE&#x2F;Fullstack Mid-Senior&#x2F;Senior - Remote( +-2 EU CET) -  Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;splash.tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;splash.tech&#x2F;</a>

We’re a small UK-based free-to-play gaming company with a distributed EU team, growing fast after recent success and scaling our platform. We’re looking for a FE&#x2F;Fullstack role, from mid-senior to senior engineer with at least 5+ years of experience.

Our engineers must be able to think product-first, and take a task from idea to production, work across the full cycle. You must write your own code, AI assistance is fine, but you must be able to produce all your work independently. We value clear thinking and communication, you should be comfortable sketching simple architecture or flow diagrams (boxes and lines, nothing formal) to explain your ideas.

You’ll also be asked to write SQL and some Java Controllers that access data. It’s ok if you don’t know Java, but our controllers are written in Java and you’ll need willingness to learn.

Our stack includes Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, SQL.

To apply, please send an email to jack[at]splash.tech with the subject “FE&#x2F;Fullstack Hackernews 2026”. Please send any git&#x2F;bitbucket&#x2F;source-forge project that represents your coding otherwise I’ll ask you to complete a small test project.
