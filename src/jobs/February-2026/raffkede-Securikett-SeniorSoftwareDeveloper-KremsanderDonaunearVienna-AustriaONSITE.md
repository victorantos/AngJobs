What we’re looking for: 5+ years production experience; strong engineering fundamentals; Java + JavaScript (other languages ok); AWS experience a strong plus (everything as CDK IaC); comfortable working autonomously.

Tech &#x2F; How we work: React, Java on AWS Lambda, serverless, strong focus on automated tests. “No Ops”, highly automated infrastructure, direct deploys to production, close collaboration with company owners.

Location: ONSITE in Krems an der Donau &#x2F; Wachau region (near Vienna). Hybrid setup: ~40–60% home office after onboarding.

Compensation: €70k–€120k depending on experience.
Austria offers strong public benefits (free childcare, kindergarten, universities), increasing effective compensation.
