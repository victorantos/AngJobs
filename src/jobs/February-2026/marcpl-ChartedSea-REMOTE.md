Charted Sea - Senior Product &amp; Platform Engineer - REMOTE - Full-time
Location: Hong Kong
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chartedsea.com&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chartedsea.com&#x2F;about</a>

Charted Sea is a small, bootstrapped SaaS company helping customers scrape very complex platforms such as Shopee (a major e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia). We focus on hard technical problems (anti-bot, browser automation, fingerprinting, captcha solving).

We are hiring a senior engineer to take ownership of our core platform: scraper orchestrator, billing &amp; payments, customer dashboard, and parts of our AI-based captcha tooling. This is a hands-on role with real ownership: architectural decisions, setting standards, and gradually mentoring other engineers. The role is very full-stack (infra, backend, frontend).

Stack includes TypeScript (most backend &amp; web), Rust (new backend services, migration in progress), Go (Android scraper), PyTorch (captcha solvers), PostgreSQL, Redis, GitHub Actions, Ansible, Ubuntu Linux, bare-metal Hetzner servers.

We are profitable, demand is growing fast, and engineering bandwidth is the main bottleneck. Team is small (3 engineers), fully remote, mostly async (we expect ~4h overlap with UTC+8).

Compensation: $80k–$120k USD base (depending on experience) + monthly bonus tied to company revenue (10% of net revenue shared with employees).

Apply by emailing marc.plouhinec@chartedsea.com with a short intro and CV&#x2F;GitHub. I&#x27;m the founder and will personally read and reply.
