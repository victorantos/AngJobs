Shepherd - ONSITE - San Francisco, CA

Shepherd is an all-in-one commercial insurance platform. We provide savings on insurance premiums for commercial businesses that are leveraging modern technology on their worksites. While we began with commercial construction, we&#x27;ve just expanded into adjacent sectors, like renewable energy &amp; power!

We’ve raised over $20M and we’re looking for product-minded engineers to join us as we continue to scale! We’re looking for someone who thrives on ownership, drives results, and cares deeply about both technical excellence and customer impact.

We’re hiring for Senior &amp; Staff-level Full Stack &amp; Backend Engineers. We’re growing the engineering team from 20 to 40 this year. And we&#x27;re also looking for two Product Managers!
