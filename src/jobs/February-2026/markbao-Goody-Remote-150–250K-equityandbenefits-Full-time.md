Goody - Remote - $150–250K + equity and benefits - North&#x2F;South America - Full-time

I&#x27;m Mark, the technical co-founder and CTO at Goody. We&#x27;re building a gifting product that every business can use to recognize employees, retain customers, and accelerate sales. Despite being something everyone does, gifting is one of the areas of commerce yet to be disrupted, and we&#x27;re working on building the best and most delightful product in this space.

Our product is used by Google, Stripe, Anthropic, Meta, NBCUniversal, Notion, and others, and we also offer a developer API for commerce. Tech stack is Ruby + React + TypeScript, though we&#x27;re flexible on backend language if you know Python or Node.js better. All roles are full-stack.

We&#x27;re coming off of a big year and planning for scale in 2026. We have a few new roles to accelerate our growth.

• Staff Software Engineer ($200–250K) — for those who ship at a startup pace and have a great eye for detail

• Senior Software Engineer, Customer Engineering ($150–200K) — if you like to hear a customer request in the morning and tell them it’s shipped in the afternoon. US and Canada only for this one

• Senior Software Engineer, Growth ($150–200K) — be the engineer who has the most direct impact on our growth

• Data Analyst ($80–140K) — build models to help power decision-making across our business (not a dev role but thought I&#x27;d include it)

We&#x27;re looking for people who have great startup energy, want to win, and bring great vibes to our tight-knit team. Great time to join since our offsite in London is happening soon (we&#x27;re US-based, this is our third international offsite).
