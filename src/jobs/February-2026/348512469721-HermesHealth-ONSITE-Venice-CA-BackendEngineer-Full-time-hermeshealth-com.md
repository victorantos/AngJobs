Hermes Health - ONSITE - Venice, CA - Backend Engineer - Full-time - hermeshealth.com

Hermes Health is building a platform to connect identified medical data sources. We are looking for a Rust backend engineer. Our backend is is entirely Rust, via Rocket, and our frontend is (currently) TS via React&#x2F;Next. However, we are moving the frontend to Rocket via maud+Datastar (similar to HTMX) in order to adopt a &quot;microlith&quot; architecture. Familiarity with event sourcing is recommended, but not required.

This is an in-person position, although we WFH on Fridays and are very flexible on other days as needed. Healthcare and dental available. We are also a startup and have just wrapped up our seed round, we have 2 years of runway and already have paying customers. Happy to discuss more details on this if you&#x27;d like.
