Unto Labs - San Francisco, CA - ONSITE (Hybrid OK), REMOTE (US) - Full-Time Unto Labs is developing the Thru Layer-1 blockchain (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thru.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thru.org</a>)
We recently announced $14.4 million in funding to make blockchains &amp; digital assets useful for the world. Founded by Jump Crypto alumni and core contributors to the Solana protocol and the Firedancer client (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;firedancer-io&#x2F;firedancer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;firedancer-io&#x2F;firedancer</a>), we’re tackling fundamental scalability, performance, and usability challenges in distributed ledgers.

Our runtime conforms to the RISC-V specification—moving away from domain-specific VMs, DSLs, and bespoke compiler toolchains that limit developer and institutional adoption. You can write smart contracts and programs in any LLVM compatible programming language and reason about a standard ISA in RISC-V. Components are developed in C for maximal control over performance and resource usage.

We believe there is a unique window of opportunity to developer fairer, more accessible, and more global financial products on resilient public blockchains.
