Mainstay - Senior&#x2F;Staff Software Engineer (Full-stack) - Remote (US) - Full-time

Mainstay is a market intelligence platform for large real-estate operators. We’re an AI-native company focused on turning complex, messy, real-world data into systems customers actually trust to make financial decisions. Mainstay was incubated at Opendoor, spun out in 2024, and recently raised a Series A led by Khosla Ventures.

We’re hiring a Senior&#x2F;Staff Software Engineers, but we care more about ownership and judgment than title.

You&#x27;ll work on:

- Designing and evolving foundational data models used across the platform

- Building backend services, workflows, and automation systems end-to-end

- Applying AI&#x2F;LLMs pragmatically (automation, reasoning over messy inputs, decision support)

- Shipping user-facing product features tied directly to real customer workflows

- Owning problems from idea → production → iteration

Stack: Python, TypeScript, React, AWS
