Midpage - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;midpage.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;midpage.ai</a> - Senior Software&#x2F;Data Engineer - prefer NYC, open to remote - Full-time - $170-240k + equity

Midpage is seeking a senior engineer to help us catalog the world&#x27;s legal data. Our dataset currently covers US case law and powers some of the largest law firms, legal technology platforms, and AI companies through our webapp, API, MCP, and custom data services. We&#x27;re currently the only vendor openly widely selling this data in the US and customers appreciate that we have good citation linkages and a citator (indication of which judgments have been overruled&#x2F;criticized).

We&#x27;re looking to expand data coverage, adapt our infrastructure to our scaling enterprise needs, and find new ways to enrich our data offerings and delight our developer customers.

We&#x27;re a team of 7, mostly in-office in lower Manhattan with a few remote&#x2F;international teammates. Seeking a backend generalist with deep Python + Postgres experience who&#x27;s ready to move quickly. Prefer NYC but flexible.

If interested email ben&#x2F;dot&#x2F;hoffner&#x2F;dash&#x2F;brodsky&#x2F;at&#x2F;midpage&#x2F;dot&#x2F;ai with HN in the subject.
