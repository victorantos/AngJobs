At E2B, we&#x27;re building an open-source computer for AI agents. Imagine you want to run 100k claude codes simultaneously, and all spin up in milliseconds.

We&#x27;re a Series A startup with 8+ figures of annual revenue. We&#x27;ve raised over $37M and have customers that are both exciting new startups (a lot of companies with billboards around SF are our customers and enterprises. We&#x27;re scaling fast, hiring all over the place, have 5+ years of runway, and a roadmap full of exciting features to build.
