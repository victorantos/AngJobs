By turning legal code into AI code, Norm enables enterprises to move faster and more comprehensively in their legal and compliance processes with reliability and trust. Norm Ai, the leading Legal &amp; Compliance AI company, has a client base with a combined $30 trillion in assets under management.

Norm’s platform combines frontier AI, proprietary legal reasoning systems, and embedded legal and regulatory expertise.

We have recently raised more than $140 million, backed by Blackstone, Bain Capital, Vanguard, Citi, New York Life, TIAA, Coatue, Craft Ventures, Henry R. Kravis (KKR co-founder), and Marc Benioff (Salesforce CEO).

Norm Ai pioneered Legal Engineering, the process that empowers lawyers to build and supervise domain-specific AI agents with Norm’s proprietary suite of no-code software tools. We hired dozens of lawyers from premier U.S. law firms and trained them as Legal Engineers, who specialize in Large Language Model powered legal workflows.

Norm Ai technology is deployed inside many of the largest and most consequential institutions in the world. The company is growing quickly and hiring in NYC across all teams, including:

- Full Stack Engineer, Senior + Staff ($190k-270k)

- Engineering Manager ($235k-270k)

- Applied AI Engineer ($220k-285k)

- Forward Deployed Engineer ($145k-250k)

We&#x27;re also hiring for many non-technical roles. The best way to apply is online on our website (we review every application!).
