Cloudflare - New York City, Austin, London, Lisbon, San Francisco, Seattle - Full Time

I’m hiring for some (IMHO) really fun product manager roles on Cloudflare’s Developer Platform (workers.cloudflare.com)
- Workers Runtime - Set vision for our V8 isolate based runtime that lets people deploy JS, TS, Rust and Python to the globe in seconds with great dev ex.
- Containers - Help build our new containers platform into the best place for both agent Sandboxes and stateless global apps.
- AI Agents - Define what Agents on Cloudflare look like: from our AgentsSDK, to Sandboxes, to MCP Servers, “Code Mode” (see our blog) and more.

We’re a really technical group, and tend to like product managers that can straddle the line between engineer and PM. You should be able to set high-level vision, understand architectural constraints, and be technical enough to really deeply understand our users (developers).

email: &lt;my-hn-username&gt;@cloudflare.com - Please add “HackerNews” to the subject line.
