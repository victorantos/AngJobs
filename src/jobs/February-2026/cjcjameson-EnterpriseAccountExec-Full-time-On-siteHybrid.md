Parabola Labs (NYC &#x2F; SF) - Enterprise Account Exec - Full-time - On-site Hybrid

We’re hiring an Enterprise AE to scale Parabola, a product used by finance and ops teams to automate messy, high-stakes workflows without needing engineers.

Parabola sits at the intersection of AI, automation, and real operational pain: unstructured data (PDFs, emails), brittle processes, constantly changing rules, and teams that can’t wait months for IT. Customers get to see live workflows in action immediately.

This is not a traditional enterprise sale... Deals are driven by automations, as they are built live in-app. Customers engage multiple times per week and see value instantly. Expansion is natural because the product is horizontal, the first team is never the last

We’re looking for someone who loves going deep on product and customer problems. You can work comfortably with operators and execs (CFO&#x2F;COO) as well as with companies in the retail&#x2F; ecom&#x2F; CPG + freight&#x2F; logistics spaces. You care deeply about solving real problems. We&#x27;re building the Enterprise motion, not just running a playbook.

Parabola had its biggest year ever in 2025. We’re consistently exceeding targets, and there is serious demand that is pulling us upmarket. You’d be working closely with our CRO, COO, CEO and GTM team to shape how Enterprise sales is done here.
If you’re an experienced AE (5+ years in SaaS sales) who wants to sell something genuinely powerful with real customer impact, we’d love to talk.
