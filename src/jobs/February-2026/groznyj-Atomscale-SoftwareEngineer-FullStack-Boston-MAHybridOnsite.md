Atomscale - Software Engineer, Full Stack - Boston, MA (Hybrid Onsite) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomscale.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomscale.ai</a>

Atomscale is building AI to improve atomic-scale materials manufacturing. Our goal is to help translate new materials into new technologies and products by making sure they can be created at scale instead of stalling at R&amp;D.

This is a hard (but exciting!) challenge that involves high-throughput data ingestion and processing pipelines, complex data visualization, and hardware integrations for direct control. The payoff is unlocking new technologies that address today&#x27;s most pressing challenges.

⎯

We&#x27;re looking for a Product-oriented Software Engineer that will:

- Build ergonomic interfaces for data visualization, workflow automation, and AI-copilot assistance.

- Develop backend systems with flexible, expressive data models and performant APIs.

- Create desktop apps for on-premises low-latency data streaming and hardware integrations.

(You don&#x27;t need background in materials science!)
