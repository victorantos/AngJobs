Loki Robotics - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lokirobotics.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lokirobotics.co&#x2F;</a> - Zurich, Switzerland (Europe) - Full Time - Onsite

We build robots that do facility management. We are an early-stage startup developing teleoperated and autonomous robots for contact-based indoor cleaning. We already have deployed robots and are planning to pivot from prototype to product.

We are looking for experienced SWEs that can work across the stack:

- Create pipelines for building, testing and deployment. This includes HIL testing, kernel compilation, multi-arch compilation, cloud and robot provisioning,...

- Design autonomous systems by building 3D occupancy maps, LiDAR odometry, or behaviour planning

- Work on a low-latency teleoperation pipeline that enables remote operation across the globe

- Integrate sensors and hardware and develop reliable drivers

Check out these SWE roles:
