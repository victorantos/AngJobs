DrSwarm - Founding Engineer (Full-Stack) - REMOTE (US or LATAM; must overlap with US Pacific hours) - Full-time or Contract to Full-time

DrSwarm is building AI-driven workflow automation for healthcare clinics &#x2F; health systems (scheduling, RCM&#x2F;billing workflows, patient ops). This is a true 0→1 role: ship fast, talk to customers, own systems end-to-end.

You will:
- Build product end-to-end (Next.js + Django)
- Ship integrations + workflow automation (APIs, webhooks, background jobs, queues)
- Own reliability (logs&#x2F;metrics, retries, failure modes) and pragmatic security (HIPAA-aware)

Stack: Next.js, React&#x2F;TypeScript, Django&#x2F;Python, Postgres, Celery&#x2F;Redis, Docker, AWS&#x2F;DigitalOcean, LLM APIs.

Looking for:
- Strong full-stack builder who ships
- Good to work with
- Can talk to customers &#x2F; users &#x2F; salespeople
- High integrity, cares about healthcare

Comp: Market with mix of base + bonus + meaningful equity

Process: 30m intro → 60m technical&#x2F;product deep dive → short paid work trial → references. I (founder) read every email and reply.

Contact: jobs@drswarm.com (include “HN Founding Engineer” in subject) + GitHub&#x2F;LinkedIn + 2–3 projects you’re proud of.
