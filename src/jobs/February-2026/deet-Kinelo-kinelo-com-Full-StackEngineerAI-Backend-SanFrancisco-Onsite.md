Kinelo - kinelo.com - Full-Stack Engineer (AI + Backend) - San Francisco - Onsite

Kinelo manages the new type of hybrid team that will emerge in the future: humans+AI working shoulder-to-“shoulder”.

Our first product helps human software engineering teams deliver more efficiently and more reliably by assisting in coordination and engineering management. But it’s built on a foundational layer that ingests data, knowledge, and process across communications and systems, exposing that to humans and AI alike.

Eventually, Kinelo will become a proper human+AI orchestration layer, managing entire companies, and our goal is to have Kinelo run Kinelo (we already dogfood it today).

We’re looking for high ownership individuals to join our small team and shape its direction. We also just opened a new SF office and new hires will have the ability to help shape company culture, engineering practices, architecture, and roadmap.

We’re well-funded (just raised another round), founded by a serial founder, anti-bureaucratic, and highly technical.

We’re looking for:

- Those who want to go 0 to 1 with high ownership: moving features and products from idea on a napkin, to prototype, to engineering UI, to shipped and polished product

- ~8 years professional experience, including the pre-LLM days with strong CS fundamentals

- A balance of wisdom from experience and optimism about the future

- Strong TypeScript and Postgres (or other RDBMS) experience at scale and with high reliability (SaaS apps, APIs, etc)

- Experience with a variety of technologies, including containerization, distributed systems, and at least one strongly typed programming language (Go, C++, Java, etc)

- Ideally experience with ML and AI systems (though expertise in ML, data science, etc is not needed for this role)

We can’t sponsor visas but relocation assistance to SF is possible.
