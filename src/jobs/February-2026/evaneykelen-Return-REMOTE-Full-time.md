Return - REMOTE - Software engineer backend (Go&#x2F;Golang) - Full-time

Return (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;return.energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;return.energy</a>) is hiring a software engineer to work on platforms that accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy. Return’s main activity is building and operating industrial-scale Battery Energy Storage Systems. Our operations are located in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and Spain. You will make a measurable, country-level impact on the transition to renewable energy. Return recently raised €300M to support its growth.

While we employ more than 120 people, Return’s technical team remains small with 13 members. Our platform automates processes in energy storage, monitoring, market optimization, sales, project management, procurement, construction, and customer service.

During the first three years of operation, we laid the foundation for our platforms, and we are ready to scale up. This is why we are looking for an experienced software engineer.

Your primary focus will be to further develop our battery virtualization platform, enabling customers to use slices of battery capacity distributed across our fleet of industrial-scale batteries.

Our tech stack and toolset are straightforward: Go, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL, TigerData, dbt, Dagster, Grafana, Terraform, and self-hosted plus cloud compute. We keep meetings to a minimum to provide at least five hours of uninterrupted coding time per day. We conduct code reviews and apply both automated and manual testing. Our web apps and platforms are often deployed multiple times per day.

Return has offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Hamburg, Munich, Madrid, and Stuttgart. We are very open to remote work as long as you live in the EU. Our hiring process is swift but thorough: a brief call to get acquainted and discuss finances, followed by one or more technical interviews, and a paid visit to Amsterdam to meet the team.

The tech team members have co-founded several companies and have worked with remote development teams since 2008, and they will personally guide you through most of the recruiting process (there is no recruiter involved).

We aim to hire you in February or March ultimately.
