Electric Twin - London, UK - Hybrid (4 days&#x2F;week in office)

Electric Twin builds simulations of real customer audiences, so teams can test decisions before shipping them — fast, safely, and at scale.

We’re a small, fast-growing team backed by top investors and operators, working with real clients on real problems. We’re hiring engineers (and other roles) who want high ownership, meaningful impact, and to help shape both the product and the company as we grow.
