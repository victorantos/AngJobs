xdof - Robotics Engineers, Infra Engineers, Product Engineers, GTM - SF Bay preferred, NYC &amp; Remote possible for non-robotics roles

At xdof, we&#x27;re at an inflection point. Frontier labs are racing to build general-purpose robots, and high-quality training data is the bottleneck. We&#x27;re building the foundation behind the foundation models – the data collection systems, operational capability, exabyte-scale data warehouse, and software toolchain – to help our partners drive the field forward.

Founded by UC Berkeley Robotics PhDs and MechEs, this is a team that executes across software, hardware, and operations faster than I can believe sometimes. This speed and ability to deliver has led to partnerships with many of the top players in the space.

We are not quite yet out of stealth, so not able to share more details here, but are so understaffed relative to demand that I&#x27;d like to start semi-public hiring ASAP.
