Plutus - Kirkland, WA (In Person) Founding Engineer - We&#x27;re building a fintech platform that democratizes sophisticated investment strategies. We&#x27;re looking for engineers who love the craft of software and take pride in what they build.

This is a hands-on technical leadership role where you&#x27;ll architect and build scalable systems, establish engineering best practices, and help shape our technical culture. You&#x27;ll own end-to-end delivery from conception to production.

===

Cloud Platform:

GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud Armor, K8S)

Languages &amp; Frameworks: Node.js, TypeScript, React

Data Store: PostgreSQL, Storage Buckets

Cache: Redis

Infrastructure: Terraform, Docker

====

You must:

1. Love the craft - You take pride in writing clean, maintainable code. You care about the details. Building software well matters to you.

2. Have battle scars - 8+ years of experience including real on-call rotations and service maintenance. You&#x27;ve been paged at 3am and know what it takes to keep systems running.

3. Be deeply curious - You dive deep into unknowns. When you don&#x27;t know something, you figure it out. You want to understand how things work, not just make them work.

4. Use AI effectively, but own the fundamentals - You leverage AI tools to move faster and be more productive, but you have deep knowledge of the entire stack. You can explain what the code does, debug when things break, and make architectural decisions without relying on AI to tell you what&#x27;s right.
