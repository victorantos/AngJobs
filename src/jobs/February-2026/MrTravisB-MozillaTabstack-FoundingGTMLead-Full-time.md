Mozilla (Tabstack) - Founding GTM Lead - Remote (US&#x2F;Canada) - Full-time

Mozilla’s New Products organization is an internal incubator for high-potential ventures. We are building Tabstack (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tabstack.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tabstack.ai</a>), the browser automation stack for AI agents. Our goal is to make it dead-simple for developers to integrate fast, reliable web interactions into agentic applications.

We are looking for a Founding GTM Lead to own the 0→1 journey. This isn&#x27;t a &quot;standard&quot; marketing role; it’s for someone with a founder’s hustle who can speak the language of AI engineers and bridge the gap between technical APIs and commercial traction.

The Role:

- Drive early customer acquisition through scrappy, high-signal experiments.

- Own messaging&#x2F;positioning for a technical audience (LangChain, Playwright, LLM orchestration).

- Translate customer friction into product roadmap priorities.

- Secure our first commercial wins and design partners.

Requirements:

- Technical Fluency: You understand browser automation mechanics and the current LLM landscape.

- 5+ years experience: A mix of DevRel, Technical Sales, PMM, or Founder experience.

- Founder Hustle: You can generate leads and write technical docs without a massive marketing budget.

Values: You align with Mozilla’s mission of a healthy, open internet.
