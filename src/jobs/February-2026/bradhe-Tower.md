Tower - Senior&#x2F;Principal Software Engineers - London, UK &#x2F; Berlin, DE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.tower.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.tower.dev</a>

Data teams waste countless hours wrestling with infrastructure instead of solving their businesses’ most critical problem: How to get more value from their data. The problem gets even worse with the AI revolution in flight. Tower changes that.

We&#x27;re a Python-native serverless platform built on Apache Iceberg with powerful ETL and Lakehouse management tools. We integrate seamlessly with enterprise systems and make companies more nimble by letting them choose the best engine for each job while maintaining full data ownership.

We&#x27;re focused on hiring developers that love the data ecosystem, are interested in really hard distributed systems problems, and working on dev tools.
