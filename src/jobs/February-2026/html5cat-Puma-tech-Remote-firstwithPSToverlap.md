Puma.tech - Remote-first with PST overlap - iOS&#x2F;MacOS, Android, Ai&#x2F;ML, Growth - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech</a>

Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma.tech. Previously worked  as software engineer &amp; developer advocate at Cloudant (YC S08, Acq. by IBM), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11, Facebook&#x2F;Meta), and explored AI&#x2F;ML (computer vision for self-driving cars).

We have two products:

1. Puma Browser (iOS &amp; Android) – browser with built in LLMs &amp; Wallets. Private by design.

2. PumaAI app for Mac – ChatGPT&#x2F;Atlas, but with ability to pick different model providers and fall-back to local-first ones for data privacy.

Open Roles: Eng (iOS&#x2F;MacOS, Android, Ai&#x2F;ML, Browser Extensions), Based Social Media Intern; Internships: Eng, Design, Growth

We’ve raised a few rounds from some of the best builders in crypto and ai:
