Mobasi - Founding Engineer - Austin, TX &#x2F; Remote - $240k + Profit Sharing - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobasi.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobasi.ai</a>

Mobasi builds autonomous AI agents for digital forensics. Our software orchestrates 150+ forensic tools to help law enforcement turn days of manual evidence analysis into minutes, aiding in cases involving child exploitation, trafficking, and homicide. We are bootstrapped, profitable, and shipping fast.

We are looking for our first hire outside the three co-founders to own infrastructure, DevOps, and compliance. You will transition our build pipeline from manual updates to an automated delivery system scaling to thousands of agencies. You will manage infrastructure across AWS, GCP, Azure, and AI providers, while owning CJIS and SOC2 compliance.

Tech Stack: Rust, TypeScript, Python, Tauri, Next.js, Docker, Pulumi, Terraform.

We work as a small SWAT team. We are AI-native and expect you to use tools like Cursor and Claude to ship significantly faster. We do not have sprints or daily standups. Instead of lottery-ticket equity, we offer a high base salary and direct profit sharing.
