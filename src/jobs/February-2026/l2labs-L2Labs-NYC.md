L2 Labs - Founding (AI&#x2F;Software) Engineer + Founding Research Scientist - NYC - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.l2labs.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.l2labs.ai&#x2F;</a>

L2 Labs is a new kind of AI lab pursuing research at the intersection of database systems and AI, driven by real-world challenges from our enterprise partners. We are backed by Cornell University, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.focal.vc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.focal.vc&#x2F;</a>, and New York University.

We are a team of hard-working, talented researchers and engineers who are obsessive about greenfield problems. We thrive on work that is equal parts compelling, difficult, and fun. Our favorite days at the office are when we get caught up ideating on a hard problem, writing code + experiments, whiteboarding, and before we know it, we&#x27;ve ordered pizza, it&#x27;s 2am and the problem is finally solved.

We are looking for talented researchers + engineers to join our Founding team. This is an owner-operator role - it&#x27;s your opportunity to help build a new kind of applied AI research lab from scratch with very meaningful upside in the form of a generous equity package.
