BuildForever - On-site (SF, NY) - Full-time

We’re a small team of creative builders (ex-OpenAI, Pinterest, startups) crafting consumer products that feel personal, magical, and deeply human. We build for ourselves first, with the belief that what delights us will resonate with millions more. We imagine a new golden age of consumer software - crafted with heart, emotion, and taste. Small, inspired teams building things that feel lovingly made, purposeful, and joyful to use. If that sounds like your happy place, you’ll fit right in.

We have several positions available. Please send us a note at careers@buildforever.com with a short intro and links to what you’ve built (systems, repos, tools, prototypes, side projects). We care more about your taste, technical creativity, and product intuition than resumes.
