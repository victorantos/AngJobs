MiLaboratories - Bilbao, Spain - ONSITE - VISA SPONSORSHIP - RELOCATION SUPPORT

We are MiLaboratories, the team behind Platforma.bio &amp; MiXCR. We are building the &quot;OS for Biology&quot;—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate biological discovery and drug development.

We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration.

We are hiring for three core roles:

1. Senior TypeScript Engineer (Desktop Platform &#x2F; SDK): This is not a dashboard or a simple web GUI. You will build the architecture of our Desktop Platform—a high-performance local application that acts as the &quot;OS&quot; interface. You will deal with complex state management, massive data throughput, and bridge directly with our high-performance Rust data layer. We need someone who treats the browser engine as a runtime for heavy applications, not just for websites.

2. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale.

3. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing production blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology (Builder profile, not just analyst).

The Offer:

Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k).

Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the &quot;Special Impatriate Regime&quot; (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions).

The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin.

Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a &quot;nice to have.&quot;

Relocation: Comprehensive &quot;Soft Landing&quot; package (Visa, temporary housing, school search).

Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living.

Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team.
