Lightning AI - lightning.ai - Senior Engineers (Full-stack, Backend, ML Platform) - NYC &amp; SF - HYBRID &#x2F; ONSITE - Full-time

Lightning AI (the creators of PyTorch Lightning) is building the OS for AI. We provide a unified platform to build, train, and deploy models and applications without the infrastructure headache.

We are looking for Senior Engineers across Full-stack, Frontend, Backend, and ML&#x2F;Inference Platform teams for our NYC and SF hubs. We operate with high autonomy—no hand-holding, just high-ownership engineering.

The Stack:

Languages: Go, Python, TypeScript, React.

Data&#x2F;Infra: Postgres, Kubernetes (K8s), AWS, GCP.

The Profile:

Seniority: Significant experience scaling production systems and distributed architectures.

Execution: You thrive in a &quot;0 to 1&quot; environment and prefer biased-towards-action, deep technical work.

Impact: You’ll build the systems that allow developers to deploy AI applications at scale.
