Count - Senior Software Engineer - REMOTE (UK&#x2F;Europe&#x2F;US East Coast) - Full-time - £100–140k (or local equivalent) + Equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;count.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;count.co</a>

Count is an infinite, real-time canvas where SQL, Python, and low-code query cells live side-by-side with visualizations and freeform whiteboarding. It replaces the traditional linear notebook with a collaborative space for modeling, analysis, and presentation.

Under the hood, we&#x27;ve built a custom WebGL rendering engine, data visualization library, graph-based modeling layer, and horizontally scalable compute engine (DuckDB-based) that dynamically shifts execution between browser and server to minimize latency and reduce database load.

You&#x27;ll help evolve the core platform: integrating agentic workflows into data exploration, pushing the performance limits of our distributed execution layer, and building powerful new analytics experiences used daily by customers. You&#x27;ll have high autonomy and ownership over major parts of the product and technical roadmap, from architecture through production.

Tech stack: TypeScript, Python, Node.js, WebAssembly, WebGL, Apache Arrow&#x2F;Parquet, DuckDB, Kubernetes, React.
