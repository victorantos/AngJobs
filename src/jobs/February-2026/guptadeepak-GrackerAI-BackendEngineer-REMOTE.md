GrackerAI - Backend Engineer - REMOTE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gracker.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gracker.ai</a>

We are building the infrastructure for the post-SEO era. As B2B buyers shift from traditional search to AI assistants like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Gemini, the old playbooks for visibility are breaking. GrackerAI provides the analytics and automation layer for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).

We help brands track their real-time AI visibility scores and automate the creation of high-intent content that these engines actually cite. We’re looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to help scale our data ingestion pipelines and LLM-based evaluation systems. You’ll be working on the core engine that benchmarks brand mentions against competitors across various model architectures.

We are a small, results-driven team focused on high-intent lead generation for SaaS. If you&#x27;re interested in the intersection of search behavior and automated content strategy, we’d love to hear from you. I am the founder and will be personally reviewing and responding to all applications.
