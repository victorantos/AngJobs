Yuzu Health (yuzu.health, Series A) - Location: New York City (Flatiron) - ONSITE

Pitch: Yuzu is not a wrapper, point solution, or integration on top of something. Our platform makes it easy for anyone to create their own health plan from scratch. That means our tech handles everything from the member&#x2F;HR portals, claims adjudication, invoice automation, member support tools, to even printing and sending out ID cards.

Why: We&#x27;re truly rebuilding health insurance from the ground up. We currently serve over 1,000 employers, and we&#x27;re growing extremely fast (like over 10x last year fast)!

Investors: We&#x27;re well funded with investors like General Catalyst, Chemistry, Anthropic, Lachy Groom, Neo and founders from startups you know like Notion, Brex, Deel, and Mercury.

Roles: We&#x27;re hiring engineers for in-person work over here at Yuzu&#x27;s HQ in Union Sq, Flatiron. Primary need is for Fullstack&#x2F;Product Engineers. You can check out our office in our recent MTV cribs office tour.

I&#x27;m Kev, the recruiting lead. Reach out to me directly if interested on kev ( at ) yuzu ( dot ) health
