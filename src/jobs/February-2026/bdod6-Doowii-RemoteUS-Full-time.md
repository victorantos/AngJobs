Doowii - Remote (US) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doowii.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doowii.io</a>

Doowii is building an “AI operating layer” for education analytics: connect your institution’s systems (SIS&#x2F;LMS&#x2F;CRM), and non-technical teams can ask questions, explore, and take action with integrated workflows and highly customized data ontology.

We’re hiring SWEs to ship AI-first product experiences and infrastructure.

Roles:
- Senior Software Engineer (AI Product &#x2F; Backend)
- Software Engineer (Full-stack, AI)
- Implementation Engineers (FDE or CXE)

What you’ll build:
- LLM-backed app features: multi-step query&#x2F;reasoning flows, conversational UX, follow-ups, citations, and “show your work”
- Evaluation + reliability: offline eval sets, regression testing for prompts&#x2F;tools, quality metrics, guardrails, and latency work
- Agentic workflows: tool-calling, retrieval over structured sources, workflows that can debug&#x2F;repair queries and guide users to the right next step
- App&#x2F;platform foundations as needed: APIs, auth&#x2F;RBAC, job orchestration, observability, and cost controls

Stack (approx): Python, TypeScript, modern web app stack, LLM tool-calling&#x2F;RAG patterns, GCP.

You might be a fit if:
- You’ve shipped real product features (backend + app), and care about UX + correctness
- You have experience building LLM-enabled systems (or you’ve built strong distributed&#x2F;backend systems and want to go deep on applied AI)

Comp: competitive salary + meaningful equity (seed-stage)
