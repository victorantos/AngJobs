TextQL - Senior Software Engineer (FT) - ONSITE - New York City - $200k Salary - $400k Total Compensation

Company: TextQL is working to drive the unit cost of a data-driven decision down to zero. We&#x27;re building the agentic data lakehouse – finding trustworthy answers to hard questions from messy enterprise data without configuring schemas, moving data, or lengthy implementation roadmaps.

Roles:

* Platform: today, no one stakes their job on AI-generated queries. You&#x27;ll build the system that changes that—giving agents the context to query enterprise data correctly, and the guardrails to prove it.

* Infrastructure: sandboxes are not enough for agents to work with enterprise data. You will develop reliable infrastructure for the first data platform designed to be operated agent-first – ETL pipelines, Trino clusters, and systems that let agents spin up infrastructure on their own.

Stack: Go, Haskell, TypeScript, DuckDB, Trino, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes, AWS

Perks: 21 days PTO, free lunch, 5% 401(k) matching, top-tier health insurance, visa sponsorship

How to Apply: email gabriel@textql.com with the most significant technical challenge you have solved, GitHub if you have one, and LinkedIn and&#x2F;or resume (PDF).
