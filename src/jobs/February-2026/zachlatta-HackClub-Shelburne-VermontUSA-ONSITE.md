Hack Club - Quality &amp; Integrity Lead, YSWS - Shelburne, Vermont (USA) - ONSITE

Hack Club (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackclub.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackclub.com</a> &#x2F; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hackclub" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hackclub</a>) is a nonprofit where 1,000s of teenagers ship real projects — games, hardware, websites, apps — and we send them free stuff in return. 100k+ teens, 140 countries. Our motto is &quot;by teens, for teens&quot; and we operate with radical trust and transparency.

Every month, thousands of projects come through our You Ship We Ship programs. Program authors do the primary reviews. We need someone to QA the reviewers — a second set of eyes who can tell us: are they making good calls? Catching the fake projects? Being too harsh on legitimate ones?

Responsibilities:

- Spot-check approved projects (random sampling)

- Audit reviewer consistency and catch patterns

- Define what &quot;high quality&quot; actually means and document it

- Train program authors to make better decisions

- Handle appeals and investigations

-  Build systems that work at 100k projects&#x2F;year

You&#x27;ll still do plenty of hands-on review — you can&#x27;t spot-check effectively without understanding the projects deeply. But your mission is ensuring the integrity of the entire process, not being the bottleneck for each submission.

$55-70k. 4 weeks PTO. Health&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision. Based in an 1800s building in Shelburne, Vermont. Full details: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiring.hackclub.com&#x2F;38523" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiring.hackclub.com&#x2F;38523</a>
