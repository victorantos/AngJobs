Arizona Optical Metrology (AOM) - Software Engineer - Tucson, AZ - Onsite - Full-time

AOM is bringing decades of experience in optical metrology to bear on some of the most demanding applications on earth—commercial space telescopes, extreme precision optics for EUV lithography, and next-gen consumer electronics.

We are looking for a Software Engineer to lead development of a computer vision based advanced metrology system. We are seeking a long-term team member, as we have further products that will be developed and would like a key team member to grow with the role.

The Role: You will own core system development, moving between high-level scientific computing and low-level hardware control. You will also go on-site to support system deployment. This includes:

Pipeline: Python (NumPy&#x2F;SciPy&#x2F;OpenCV) for numerical computing and image processing.

Performance: Rust for real-time frame processing and optimized solvers. (We offer opportunities to learn Rust on the job).

Hardware: Camera SDKs (PySpin), display synchronization, and timing-critical acquisition loops.

Math: Sparse linear algebra, FFT, polynomial fitting, and geometric optics.

Requirements:

BS&#x2F;MS in CS, Physics, or Optical Engineering.

Strong Python experience (NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV).

Systems-level thinking (state management, error handling, timing).

Bonus: Rust experience, hardware interface experience, or a background in optics&#x2F;physics.

We are looking for someone who enjoys the intersection of software, math, and physical hardware.
