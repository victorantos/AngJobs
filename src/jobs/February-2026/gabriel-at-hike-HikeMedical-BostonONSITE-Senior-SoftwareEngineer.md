Hike Medical - Boston (ONSITE) - Senior+ Software Engineer

Hike Medical is reinventing musculoskeletal care, starting with feet. Our proprietary AI-vision platform turns a 30 second web based (yes, no sensors) foot scan into precision engineered, 3D-printed insoles that prevent pain before it starts. We&#x27;re already protecting on-their-feet workforces at Fortune 50 leaders, major health systems, and middle America manufacturers. Fresh off a stealthy round with top tier VCs, we run a fast, no BS, execution first culture out of Boston’s Seaport as we sprint toward $100M ARR and standing with 10M Americans as they step into their shoes daily.

As the backbone of Hike&#x27;s high-growth, mission-driven platform, you’ll design scalable services, implement production AI, and deliver user experiences that improve patient outcomes. From day one, you’ll have real autonomy and clear impact on transforming the US healthcare system.
