ChipStack is a company building AI-powered tools for chip design and verification. At the core of the platform are fine-tuned LLMs, extensive flow engineering to solve complex problems with LLMs, integrations with existing EDA tools, and high-quality UI&#x2F;UX.

We are looking to hire a top-notch senior full-stack SWE who leans towards the frontend (in the beginning). You will get to work with highly experienced chip designers, ML scientists, and other fellow SWE. We take pride in paying well for top talent and maintaining an open, innovative culture.

Why should you join?: Chips are at the center of the technology-driven world today. As such it is a consequential, challenging, and worthy problem to work on. The value we build is substantial, and you will enjoy working in a highly interdisciplinary field involving chip design, AI, and SW. We are funded by top investors, work with well known names in chip design.
