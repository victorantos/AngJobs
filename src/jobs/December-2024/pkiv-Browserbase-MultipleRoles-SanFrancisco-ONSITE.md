Browserbase - Multiple Roles - San Francisco - ONSITE

We&#x27;re building infrastructure that enables developers and LLMs to programmatically interact with the web using our hosted headless browsers.

A headless browser is just like the browser you&#x27;re using right now, but running on a server. Running a single one isn&#x27;t too bad, but running many of them becomes a complex exercise in stateful, distributed systems. We handle that, as well as provide great observability and other helpful features (like cookies management) to make developer&#x27;s lives easier.

While the infrastructure product is how we make money, we also maintain Stagehand (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;browserbase&#x2F;stagehand">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;browserbase&#x2F;stagehand</a>), the AI-powered successor to Playwright. We built it to show how you can use LLMs to build dynamic web automations that don&#x27;t depend on deterministic code.

We&#x27;re looking for developers who are interested in working on products that cater to other developers. You&#x27;re an especially good fit if you&#x27;re experienced in cloud infrastructure or distributed systems.
We&#x27;re a team of 10, full time in-person in-SF. You can learn more about our work culture here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;pk_iv&#x2F;status&#x2F;1860762063490158642" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;pk_iv&#x2F;status&#x2F;1860762063490158642</a>. We have product-market-fit, and have raised $27M from Kleiner Perkins, CRV, and Okta Ventures.

I&#x27;ve hired several people from HN and I&#x27;m excited to continue meeting great people like yourself!
