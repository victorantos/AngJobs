We&#x27;re bringing currency back to cryptocurrency. We care a LOT about UX and are at the forefront of chain and account abstraction. Weâ€™re making crypto actually usable as a currency and not just a degenerate gambling fiesta.

We are VC-funded ($1.4m pre-seed), advised by heavyweights like ex-venmo CTO, and founded by Harvard alum.
