Felt - Elixir Contractor - Oakland, CA or REMOTE (US timezones) - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com</a>

Felt is building a cloud-based geographic information systems (GIS) solution and have hundreds of customers already using it to run their operations, processing terabyte. Our team hails from Uber, Google, Meta, CARTO, Mapbox, The New York Times and a few others. If you have used online maps in the past few years like hundreds of millions of people do every day, you have used their work. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC 2014 founder who sold his previous company [1] and I&#x27;m an early Uber engineer.

We are on the lookout for an exceptional Elixir engineer on a contract basis for our Applications team. This team builds what our end-users experience; a lightning fast and easy-to-use mapping tool that works in the browser. We are primarily using Elixir &#x2F; Phoenix on the server side and have a spatially focused React on the frontend side. As an Elixir engineer, you&#x27;ll be working with folks who are experts in their field [2], release more than 15+ a day [3], and aren&#x27;t afraid to break new ground when necessary [4]. Our larger team builds a data ingestion and processing pipeline that churns through terabytes of data and make it accessible.

We are well-funded and just raised our $15M Series A. You can read more about it our funding here [5], and our announcement here [6].

Once again, this is a contract role; we pay competitively for the right talent.

If you are interested, please reach out via hello@felt.com and mention HN. We can&#x27;t wait to hear from you!
