Journalytic - Software Engineer - REMOTE (US) - Full-time

Journalytic is an early stage company building the world’s first Investment Operating System for professional investors. We are a small team with decades of business, investing, and technology experience. We’re backed by a cadre of amazing public and private market investors who believe in our long-term vision. They want to use the tools we’re building in their own firms.

We are currently a remote team, with concentrations in Pennsylvania, Northern California, and Seattle. This role is perfect for an engineer who relishes complex technical challenges in a fast-paced startup environment. (We don’t have a lot of pointless meetings.) You’ll be joining a team of passionate A+ players who will support you and challenge you to grow.
