Stanford Research Computing - Stanford, CA (next to Palo Alto) - Full-time - Two positions - HYBRID

Stanford Research Computing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu</a>) is a collaboration between University IT and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. We operate HPC environments for researchers, we do one-time consultations on projects (from software and pipelines, to data management, to physical building design and fit-out), and we provide contract support for individual Labs, Departments, and Schools.

We have two open positions:

• Research Computing Manager: Our current IC:Manager ratio is 7, which is too high, so we&#x27;re hiring another manager for our group! You&#x27;ll oversee a number of ICs, help them plan &amp; prioritize their work, make policy decisions, and contribute to Research Computing&#x27;s strategic direction. You&#x27;ll also be interacting with groups throughout the University, as a service provider and as a policy maker.

• Research Storage Consultant: We have lots of storage environments (both on-prem &amp; cloud); it can be confusing to identify which is the best for a given purpose, and how to take full advantage of it. Your job will be to help Students &amp; Faculty figure out what storage is best to use, and get them started on using it!

If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you drive, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site. There is some on-call around the holidays. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation). All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards</a>.
