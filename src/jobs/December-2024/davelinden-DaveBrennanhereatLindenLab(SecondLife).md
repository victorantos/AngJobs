Dave Brennan here at LindenLab (Second Life)

We&#x27;re looking for a fantastic SSE who&#x27;s a great teammate!

Role Overview

This is a hybrid role, assigned to our San Francisco worksite, and candidates must be available to work on-site a few days per week and be flexible for ad hoc in-office meetings as needed.

We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer (Server) to join Second Life&#x27;s Server team and help develop mobile backend applications and the persistent real time simulation software behind one of the world&#x27;s most long-lived and rich virtual worlds.

This is an independent contributor role, reporting to the Director, Engineering of Second Life. In this role, you will create new features and improve core functionality of the platform, taking projects through their full lifecycle, from idea to release and help maintain them afterwards. This role will be hybrid in our San Francisco office three days a week.

The stability of an established company with new startup momentum. An unparalleled opportunity to create  relationships, systems, strategy and culture. An environment where your voice will be heard and your impact deeply felt. A sense of belonging where your work is appreciated and rewarded.

Second Life&#x27;s huge, persistently simulated virtual topography runs 24&#x2F;7. You will have opportunities to work on unique engineering problems that cannot be found anywhere else and that meaningfully impact the lives of millions of residents. You will also be given the time and support needed to grow your skills and knowledge.
