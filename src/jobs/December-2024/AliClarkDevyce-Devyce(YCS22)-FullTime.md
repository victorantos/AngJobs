Devyce (YC S22) - UK (remote&#x2F;onsite&#x2F;hybrid) - Senior Frontend&#x2F;Fullstack&#x2F;Backend Developers - Full Time

We&#x27;re redesigning the business phone network from the ground up. Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we&#x27;re losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want.

We try to be flexible around work and don&#x27;t believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work&#x2F;life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children.

We&#x27;re looking for full stack software engineers - doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there&#x27;s no &quot;front end team&quot; once the backend is done. There is naturally work that&#x27;s much more one sided, so you won&#x27;t be stuck for months on the front end if you prefer the backend, but we&#x27;re still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can!

You&#x27;ll need to visit our London office roughly once a month.
