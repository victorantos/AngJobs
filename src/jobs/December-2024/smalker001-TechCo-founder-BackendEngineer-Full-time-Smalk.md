Who We’re Looking For;

First, please keep in mind: we’re describing the background we imagine would best fit the role. If you don’t meet every requirement but feel confident you can handle the challenge, we still want to hear from you! We know this is an ambitious challenge, and we need the right technical partner to tackle it with us. Specifically:

- The Engineer: Deep expertise in Backend Engineering, GenAI (with focus on Search&#x2F;RAG), and scalable architecture. You must be able to handle large daily data pipelines.
- The Leader: Someone with strategic and hands-on experience, who can guide both vision and execution.
- The Changemaker: Someone who thrives on building from scratch and exploring uncharted territory.

Ideally, our tech co-founder will be building with us on-site in Paris

If this resonates, let’s connect and see if our vision aligns.

If it&#x27;s not you but you know someone you trust could be a fit, I would love a warm intro.
