AI Insurance (YC W19) - Senior Software Engineer - Lead App Factory Specialist - Hybrid (San Francisco) or Remote

AI Insurance (aiinsurance.io) is the platform that small-to-midsize insurance companies use to run every part of their business. Before we showed up, they used spreadsheets and filing cabinets – wasting as much as 60% of revenue on administrative expenses. We’re doing what Salesforce did for SMB sales teams, but we’re tapping into the over 10,000 insurance companies that waste $238 Billion dollars annually.
