Parley - Founding Engineer - San Francisco, CA - Full-Time

Hi there, I&#x27;m Ian Edwards - one of the co-founders of Parley (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parley.so">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parley.so</a>). We help automate legal drafting for immigration attorneys and other flat-fee lawyers. Currently, we are helping immigration firms of various sizes prepare work visas and green cards faster, so lawyers can spend more time on case strategy, client interaction, and operations.

We are currently a team of three and are looking to bring on additional product-minded engineers to help build out key features and expand our offering.

Feel free to reach out to me directly at ian@parley.so, and mention that you found us on HN!
