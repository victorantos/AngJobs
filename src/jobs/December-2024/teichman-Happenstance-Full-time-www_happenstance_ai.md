Happenstance - Design engineers &amp; AI&#x2F;infra engineers - Bay Area or Remote (US&#x2F;Canada) - Full-time - www.happenstance.ai

So much of making progress is about finding the right person at the right time. Happenstance exists to create 10x more of this kind of luck in the world.

Backed by Garry Tan and Elad Gil, we&#x27;ve built the world&#x27;s best AI person search by a wide margin. No more keyword search; just describe the kind of person you&#x27;re looking for. We&#x27;re already used by 1000+ YC alums to accelerate their customer development, sales, and fundraising.

To apply, email one paragraph about one of the hardest problems you solved, plus whatever else you like, to: careers@happenstance.ai
