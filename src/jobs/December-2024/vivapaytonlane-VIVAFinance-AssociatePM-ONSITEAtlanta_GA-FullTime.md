VIVA Finance is systematically changing how consumers are overlooked in accessing and managing credit. We offer personal, unsecured loans to working Americans. The VIVA difference is that we underwrite our loans using employment information rather than credit score, allowing workers with stable jobs to access affordable credit that many wouldnâ€™t have otherwise. Founded in 2019, we are a venture-backed start-up. We hit cash flow positivity in May and continue to hit new milestones of growth each month. We are growing the product team to further support our personal lending product and engineering team, and to support the building of new products to diversify our revenue streams.

As the current PM, you would be joining me and a wonderful team of 10 full-time FE and BE engineers and a designer. As an associate PM you would get to work intimately with our engineering team, host of stakeholders, our designer and our customers. You would be a good fit if you are:
- eager to learn
- highly communicative
- organized and detail-oriented 
- interested in the SDLC and product strategy
