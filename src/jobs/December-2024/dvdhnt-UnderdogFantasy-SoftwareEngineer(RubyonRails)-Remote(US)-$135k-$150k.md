Underdog Fantasy - Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails) - Remote (US) - $135k - $150k

We’re the fastest-growing sports gaming company ever.

We build innovative games and products for American sports fans.

Founded in 2020, our team built four of today’s most widely played fantasy games and recently launched our Underdog Sportsbook. We are the only sportsbook to ever launch on our own home grown technology, which allows us to build different and innovative experiences. We believe there’s so much more to be built for sports fans, and we’ll continue to win by building the best products and experiences for our customers.

The opportunity in front of us to become the biggest company in our space is massive; after all, we’re currently sitting in the fastest-growing consumer industry in the U.S. In just over two years, we reached a nearly $500 million valuation through some of the best investors in the game, including Mark Cuban, Kevin Durant, BlackRock, and SV Angel. We are many times larger now and our growth is not slowing down.

At Underdog, we believe that sports are for everyone and are building a tomorrow for every fan. Want to help create that future? Join us.

We are hiring for other roles including mobile and data.
