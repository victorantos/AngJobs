(REMOTE) Looking for someone with experience with ads to help me out with a simple games site in the vein of Wordle or 2048. Site is written in Typescript frontend and back. Express.js backend and React frontend.

Basically a one-time gig project, not a full-time position. I don&#x27;t know much about setting ads up and have had limited luck in my initial research into it since it seemed Google Ads doesn&#x27;t support sites that aren&#x27;t full of rich text content (i.e. not games sites) and most other ad providers require you to already have a large userbase or else to use them as your DNS which I didn&#x27;t want to do.
