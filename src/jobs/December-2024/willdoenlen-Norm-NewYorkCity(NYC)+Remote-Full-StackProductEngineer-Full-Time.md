Norm is building AI that understands regulations for regulatory compliance. Our AI currently automates compliance determinations for federally regulated financial content, though our vision is to build a platform that can handle any regulation in any industry. As AI begins to permeate our society, Norm aims to become a critical building block for other AI systems that need regulatory intelligence. You can read more about our vision here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norm.ai&#x2F;post&#x2F;building-regulatory-ai-agents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norm.ai&#x2F;post&#x2F;building-regulatory-ai-agents</a>
