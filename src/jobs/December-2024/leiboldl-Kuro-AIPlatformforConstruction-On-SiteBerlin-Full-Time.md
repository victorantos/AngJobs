About Kuro:
Kuro is transforming how the construction industry operates and takes decision by unlocking unprecedented productivity in a sector that’s been stuck in a decades-long deadlock.
Our initial product speeds up the quoting process for building construction by 90%. While it typically takes construction companies 6 weeks to sift through 1,000+ documents to identify risks and define what needs to be built, our AI scans these documents automatically, identifies risks, and enriches building components into a 3D model, unlocking multi-million € ROIs.
