Receipts - Remote (US only) - Senior Mobile (React Native) Engineer - Full-time - $145 - $170k + meaningful equity + benefits

Receipts (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;receipts.xyz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;receipts.xyz</a>) is creating a new economy around fitness and wellness â€” one that rewards people for consistent physical activity while giving brands a proper channel to engage with core customers.

We authenticate heart rate data through wearables and smartwatches (proof of workout). Based on the minutes spent at an elevated heart rate each week, users earn points that may be redeemed for exclusive perks and experiences, both within our app and through our partners.

Today, 1.8 billion adults aren&#x27;t physically active enough and lack of physical activity is the 4th highest risk factor for global mortality - Receipts is on a mission to change that.

We&#x27;re backed by top-tier funds and angels in crypto&#x2F;blockchain, have a live app with obsessed users, and have worked with brands like Coinbase, Garmin, and On Running. We&#x27;re going to 100x from here.

Stack: React Native, Expo, AWS, Stacktape, GraphQL, Apollo
