Drone startup - Senior Software Engineer, Fullstack Software Engineer - 2 days&#x2F;week in the office (London, UK) - UK citizens only

You&#x27;d be working with other passionate product engineers who previously worked at Google, Amazon, Helsing, Darktrace and Improbable. You&#x27;d be working alongside me in building a modern, ground control station application for drones using web technology. For my project, we use React, Tailwind, drizzle-orm, SQLite, Postgres, maplibre, deck.gl, Node, Python, asyncio, FastAPI and more.

Examples of things we&#x27;re building: low latency data and video streaming services for collaboration, or intuitive&#x2F;modern applications for planning and performing drone missions.

If interested, please reach out to my temporary disposal email: demise-collar-lurk@duck.com

We highly value passionate engineers with personal projects or technical hobbies. We also value collaboration: pair programming, discussing, teaching and learning from others.
