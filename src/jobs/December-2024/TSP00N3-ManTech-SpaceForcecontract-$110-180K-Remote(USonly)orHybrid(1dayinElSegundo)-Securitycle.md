ManTech - Space Force contract - Systems&#x2F;Applications Admin - $110-180K - Remote (US only) or Hybrid (1 day in El Segundo) - Security clearance required (can get on the job)

7 years of experience minimum (preferably 10 years), with wiggle room on types of experience. Work is in Atlassian Jira&#x2F;Confluence, Palantir Foundry, Microsoft PowerApps, and similar applications, as well as some full stack DevOps type work. Jack of all trades or willing to learn multiple skill sets is a plus.
