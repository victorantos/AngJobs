Hi are you based in the UK? We are looking for Junior, Mid to Senior Full Stack Engineers.

This is Leon, the CTO at Literal Labs. At Literal Labs, we build state of the art Machine Learning algorithms for the Edge and other targets that go brrr, and are looking for talented engineers to help us build web training tools to put these models in the hands of users.

This role is remote, though the right to work for a UK-registered company is required. Read here for more about how we work:
