Stealth dev tool startup - Founding product&#x2F;systems&#x2F;ML engineer - Onsite San Mateo - Up to 200k + 1% equity

Coding velocity has increased with AI agents, but shipping velocity has worsened in engineering organizations of 100+. The root cause is new bottlenecks that have emerged in DevSecOps with 5x increase in code and manual processes in shipping. We are building DevSecOps agent to better orchestrate the 20+ tools devs use weekly.

3 founders, each with 10+ years building in successful dev tool or AI startups. Top tier investors. More details at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.gem.com&#x2F;accelos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.gem.com&#x2F;accelos</a>
