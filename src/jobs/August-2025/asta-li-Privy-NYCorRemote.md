Privy - NYC or Remote - Staff engineering roles (Backend, Frontend, Security &amp; more) - Full-Time <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.privy.io&#x2F;careers#open-positions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.privy.io&#x2F;careers#open-positions</a>

Hi, I&#x27;m Asta, CTO at the identity and wallet infra startup Privy. We build a wallet and digital asset API that over a thousand companies integrate in order to onboard (75M+) users onto products built with blockchain infra and distributed systems.

We solve hard product design and security problems in order to shift the status quo around digital ownership and protect the accounts and assets of millions of users. With our work, we stand to transform how users think about asset ownership and money movement online.

We&#x27;re a small, high-ownership team building a product with incredibly scaled usage (&gt;12M MAUs, massive transaction volume). We were recently acquired by Stripe â€” while we&#x27;ll remain an autonomous team and stand alone product, joining Stripe will help significantly accelerate our growth and impact.
