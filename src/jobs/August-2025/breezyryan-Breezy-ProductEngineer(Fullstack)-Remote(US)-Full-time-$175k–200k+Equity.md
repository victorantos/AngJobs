Breezy - Product Engineer (Fullstack) - Remote (US) - Full-time - $175k–200k + Equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getbreezyapp.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getbreezyapp.com</a>

Breezy is modern field service software purpose-built for residential HVAC companies. We combine thoughtful product design, tight customer feedback loops, and best-in-class technology, including LLMs when they’re the right tool for the job, to help contractors grow, streamline operations, and run world-class businesses. We’re already replacing legacy systems like ServiceTitan and Housecall Pro.

We’re a small, senior team with experience scaling successful startups. We ship quickly, stay close to our customers, and take pride in building products that actually move the needle for our customers.

We’re hiring a senior Product Engineer to help define and build the product. This role goes beyond writing code. You’ll weigh in on product strategy, shape user experience, and explore how emerging tools like LLMs can create real customer value. You’ll work across the stack (TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL) and own features from idea to production in a high-velocity environment.

We’re looking for someone T-shaped: broad technical range, depth in a few areas, strong product instincts, and a sharp eye for delivering customer value. You should be genuinely excited about AI engineering and not just comfortable with LLMs and modern dev tooling, but actively raising the bar for how your team uses them.

Tech Stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS
Comp: $175–200k + equity, full health benefits, 401(k), remote-first with periodic team offsites
