Stainless - Engineers, EMs, GTM, Former Founders - NYC &amp; SF (onsite) - Full-time

When you npm install openai or pip install anthropic, you’re pulling code generated by Stainless.

We’re building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs — and companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare already rely on us.

We’re ~3 years old, ~35 people, with strong revenue, several years of runway, and backing from Sequoia and a16z.

As one of our first 25 engineers, you’ll have real ownership, autonomy to build great products, and a direct hand in shaping the future of how developers consume APIs.
We’re looking for exceptionally productive, thoughtful, and kind people who want to make software development better for everyone.
