Oxidian - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxidian.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxidian.com</a> - Remote (Ireland&#x2F;EU ONLY)

We make sure public money is well invested by building software for governments. We&#x27;re doing to government software services what challenger banks did to banking.

Our clients are mainly governmental research institutions - we&#x27;re building tools for scientists to process &amp; visualise data, HPC data processing libraries, web apps to make people&#x27;s working lives easier, and DevOps pipelines.

Currently hiring a senior python dev, a mid-level python dev, and a senior rust&#x2F;c++ dev.

We do government work so the location requirement is strict. Save yourself some time and don&#x27;t apply if you&#x27;re outside the EU.
