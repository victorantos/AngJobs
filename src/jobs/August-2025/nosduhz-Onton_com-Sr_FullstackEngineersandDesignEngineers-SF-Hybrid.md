Onton.com - Sr. Fullstack Engineers and Design Engineers - SF - Hybrid

Join us in pioneering the future of e-commerce search. 1M+ MAU growing rapidly. $10M+ raised from top-tier VCs and individuals with backgrounds from Google, Amazon, OpenAI, Stitch Fix, Whatnot, Stripe, and more.

We&#x27;re a hard-working team of 6. We have a new office in Jackson Square with a great view that we&#x27;re looking to fill with other high-performance people!

Tech-wise, it&#x27;s React&#x2F;Typescript + Julia, if that&#x27;s interesting (no worries if you haven&#x27;t used it). We&#x27;ve also built our own graph db to cope with the scale, and the foundations of a neuro-symbolic AI agent that learns more about the world on every search!

We read and respond to every application.
