HomeCloud - Senior Cloud Engineer (AWS &#x2F; Node.js &#x2F; TypeScript) - Remote (US, EU UTC-6 to UTC+2) - Full-Time (Contractor)

HomeCloud is a fast-growing proptech startup rethinking home inspections, onboarding, and management using cloud-native systems and AI. We just raised a $3.5M seed round from top VCs and are building intelligent infrastructure for the future of homeownership.

We’re looking for a Senior Cloud Engineer to help us build scalable backend systems on AWS using Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, EventBridge, and more. You’ll work with a modern serverless stack, integrate AI services (e.g. OpenAI, Bedrock), and help define our engineering culture alongside the CTO and founding team.

You might be a fit if you:

• Have 5+ years of experience building serverless systems on AWS

• Are fluent in Node.js + TypeScript

• Have worked with serverless architecture and event-driven systems

• Are curious about AI&#x2F;LLM APIs and how to integrate them into real-world workflows

• Value ownership, pragmatism, and building useful products quickly

This is a high-impact, remote-first role on a small, focused team building the foundation of a data-rich, AI-powered platform.

Remote (UTC-6 to UTC+2)
