Apollo Agriculture - Full Stack Software Engineer - Full-time - Amsterdam, NL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apolloagriculture.com&#x2F;team" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apolloagriculture.com&#x2F;team</a>
Apollo Agriculture (YC F1) is bringing modern farming to the world&#x27;s poorest farmers. Millions of farmers globally don&#x27;t have access to the basic resources the rest of the world depends on for food production: good seed and fertilizer. We sell these on credit, use ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably, and are growing rapidly (two countries and growing).

We are a small, motivated team with SV roots and an ownership culture. Come help us make a real difference in the world!

Our core engineering team supports a wide range of tools and processes. Our primary stack is Scala 2 w&#x2F; cats, backed by psql. If you are an experienced and practical problem solver, we&#x27;d love to meet you.

... due to our size and focus, we look for candidates who are experienced and can be autonomous -- at least at the &quot;senior&quot; level. Visa sponsorship is possible!

Drop me a line at elijah@apolloagriculture.com if you&#x27;re interested; I&#x27;m happy to chat.
