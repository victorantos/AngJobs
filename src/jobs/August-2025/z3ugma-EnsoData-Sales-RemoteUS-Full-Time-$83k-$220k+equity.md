Sleep is vital to recharging mentally, restoring our bodies physically, and fighting off disease. Sleep is so core to our health that it&#x27;s the activity we all spend most of our life doing.

* Yet sleep disorders are some of the most underdiagnosed health conditions on the planet, with an estimated 80% of obstructive sleep apnea patients undiagnosed and untreated

* EnsoData uses pulse oximeters paired with machine learning and mobile apps with a clinician portal to automate sleep study scoring and give sleep clinicians tools to find and help patients with sleep disorders.

* We&#x27;re hiring 12 regional sales executives around the USA to build relationships with sleep clinicians and figure out which of our product can help solve their problems. Base comp is $83-90k based on experience, plus commission with TC of $220k
