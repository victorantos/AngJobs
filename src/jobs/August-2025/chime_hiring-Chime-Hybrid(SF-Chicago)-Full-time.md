Chime - Engineering Manager &amp; Staff Engineer, Machine Learning Platform - Hybrid (SF - Chicago) - Full-time

At Chime, we’re building the ML platform that powers real-time decisions across fraud, risk, personalization, and growth. We’re hiring for both an Engineering Manager and a Staff Engineer to help lead and grow this critical part of our infra.

As an Engineering Manager, you’ll lead a small, high-leverage team building scalable systems for model training (batch + real-time), low-latency serving, feature pipelines, and observability. As a Staff Engineer, you’ll be hands-on shaping architecture, driving deep technical decisions, and mentoring others across the org. Our stack includes Kubernetes, Airflow, Spark, Ray, and SageMaker, and we support hundreds of models in production. You’ll work closely with DS, Infra, and Risk to make ML faster, safer, and easier to use across Chime.

If you’ve built platforms for ML or data teams, have strong systems thinking, and care about both developer experience and scaling impact—we’d love to chat.
