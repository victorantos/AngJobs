ZioSec Is Hiring a Senior Backend Engineer (Rust&#x2F;PostgreSQL&#x2F;GCP) - Remote

The Problem: Agentic AI systems are becoming increasingly powerful and autonomous. Most companies deploying them have no idea how vulnerable they are. We&#x27;re building the offensive security platform that will become the industry standard for AI safety testing.

The Opportunity: Join us as our lead Backend Engineer and own critical infrastructure that will protect the next generation of AI systems. You&#x27;ll architect high-performance Rust services that facilitate AI-driven attacks, manage complex state machines for AI agent interactions, and build the data pipeline that turns chaos into actionable security insights.
