Brico takes the hassle out of financial licensing for Financial Institutions and FinTechs. We automate new license applications, maintenance, and renewals, creating a 1-stop shop for all licensing needs. Put simply, we are creating from the ground-up dedicated AI-augmented software to manage complex regulatory compliance workflows that used to live in spreadsheets and emails, across all 50+ US jurisdictions.
