Yardstik - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yardstik.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yardstik.com&#x2F;</a> - Staff Engineer - Minneapolis or San Francisco (remote possible)

Yardstik is on a mission to reduce workforce risk through tools like background checks, identity verification, fraud monitoring and more.  We are a well capitalized fast growing company based in Minneapolis but with a distributed workforce.

We’re looking for a Staff Engineer to help us build a brand new line of Risk products.

This isn’t just a heads-down coding role. You’d be leading the technical direction for an entirely new product category — shaping the architecture, making key system decisions, and working closely with Product and Go-To-Market to bring it all to life.

We’re a Ruby on Rails shop, so if you’ve got deep experience with Rails (and opinions on how to scale it well), you’ll feel right at home. You’ll have a ton of ownership, real input into the roadmap, and the chance to build something from the ground up that truly helps our customers reduce risk in smarter ways.
