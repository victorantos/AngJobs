OnePool - Valencia, Spain - Flexible (preferably on-site) - Founding CTO &#x2F; Technical Cofounder - Full-time + Equity

We’re building the first group payment platform that integrates directly into merchant checkouts. Backed by real user demand and selected by Lanzadera (Spain’s top startup accelerator), OnePool is looking for a technical cofounder to lead the development of our MVP and shape the future of collaborative payments.

What you’ll do:

- Lead the architecture and development of our first product

- Work closely with PSPs integrations

- Build and maintain APIs, webhook logic, and payment flow orchestration

- Own technical decisions from infrastructure to deployment

- Define our engineering culture and roadmap as a core founding member

Nice-to-haves (not all required): Next.js, Go&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Node, typescript, payment integrations, full-stack dev, early-stage products, fintech or checkout UX

About us:
We’re a small team with backgrounds in product, growth, and early-stage startups. OnePool simplifies one of the most frustrating payment flows for users and businesses alike — and we’re ready to build fast with the right tech partner on board.
