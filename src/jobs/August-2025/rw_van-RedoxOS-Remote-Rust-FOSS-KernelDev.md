Redox OS - Remote - Rust - FOSS - Kernel Dev

Redox OS is a Unix-like general-purpose microkernel-based operating system written in Rust, aiming to be a complete alternative to Linux and BSD. It is community developed and MIT licensed.

Redox is seeking an OS&#x2F;kernel developer, paid through a combination of grants and contract work. If you are a committed FOSS developer, with expertise in Rust, device drivers and performance-optimized software, we are interested in hearing from you.

This is a fully remote position. There are some geographic preferences and limitations. Check out this month&#x27;s report for more details.
