StorPool - Senior Software Engineer, Storage Core (C&#x2F;Linux) - Remote (UTC-1 to UTC+5) - Full-time

StorPool is a profitable, self-funded company building one of the fastest, most reliable distributed block storage platforms in the world. Our software powers modern clouds with latency under 100µs, up to 113M IOPS per cluster, 99.999% measured availability, and a fantastic customer NPS.

We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer (C&#x2F;Linux) to join our Core Storage team — the group behind the engine that delivers these results. You’ll work on advanced distributed systems problems: custom Linux drivers, low-level disk I&#x2F;O, data replication, lock-free algorithms, and fault tolerance at scale. We’re remote-first (UTC-1 to UTC+5) and value autonomy, written communication, and a relentless drive for technical excellence.
