MeritFirst - Software Engineer - Austin, TX (onsite)

MeritFirst is a VC-backed startup building a new way to identify talent, where intelligence, problem-solving, and adaptability matter more than credentials. We&#x27;re a small, profitable team using a modern stack (TypeScript, Next.js, Postgres&#x2F;Drizzle, Vercel).

You&#x27;ll work side-by-side with the founders, own features end-to-end, and have direct input into product decisions. Competitive salary + equity.
