Class Central - Developer Education Specialist (Course Guide Author) - Remote (Global) - Full-time - 
We’re the most popular search engine for online courses, and we’re hiring a deeply technical writer-researcher to help learners master tech skills by testing advanced courses and publishing “best course” guides.

You’ll: research, test, and evaluate courses (e.g., LangChain, DevSecOps, Nginx, pen-testing) and write clear, actionable guides with charts&#x2F;images&#x2F;layouts.

You are: a curious polyglot learner and clear writer, fluent with the command line, and comfortable driving projects in a remote team.

How we work: full-time, remote-first, async, very few meetings; we’re profitable and independent so you can ship fast and have real impact.

AI policy: AI can speed you up, but this is hands-on research and writing—you find and test the best courses yourself (not a prompt-engineering role).

Process: application review → paid writing test → interview with founder → paid trial → decision.
