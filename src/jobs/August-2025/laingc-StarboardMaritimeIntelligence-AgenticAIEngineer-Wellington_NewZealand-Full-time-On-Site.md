Starboard Maritime Intelligence - Agentic AI Engineer - Wellington, New Zealand - Full-time - On-Site

Starboard builds mission-critical intelligence platforms for the defence, national security, and maritime enforcement sectors. Our software fuses complex datasets—including satellite imagery (SAR&#x2F;EO), vessel tracking (AIS), and proprietary intelligence to help our customers identify and respond to illicit and threatening activities at sea. We work on challenges like sanctions evasion, illegal fishing, and maritime security operations.

We are seeking our first Agentic AI Engineer to pioneer a new capability within the company. This is a foundational role with significant autonomy, responsible for designing and building an &quot;AI Agent Workforce&quot; from the ground up. Your objective will be to leverage agentic AI to enhance operational effectiveness and accelerate the intelligence cycle across our business—from engineering to analysis. This is a hands-on-keyboard role focused on deploying robust, auditable, and secure AI systems, not just theoretical research.

Example responsibilities:

- Develop agents to automate the initial analysis of raw data streams, generating draft intelligence summaries for our analyst teams.

- Build agents to assist with static code analysis, security vulnerability scanning, or triaging failures in our secure deployment pipelines.

- Create agents to perform real-time horizon scanning, monitoring multiple data feeds to flag and contextualise key maritime events.

- Establish the company-wide standards, tooling, and security frameworks for the development and deployment of all AI agents.

We&#x27;re looking for someone with:

- Demonstrable, hands-on experience building functional AI agent systems. This can be from professional, academic, or personal projects.

- Proficiency in Python.

- A deep-seated curiosity for emerging AI technologies and a systematic approach to experimentation.

- An understanding of how to apply technology to solve concrete business and operational problems, with a strong sense of ownership.

IMPORTANT - SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Due to the nature of our work with government defence and intelligence partners, this role has strict security clearance requirements. To be eligible, you MUST have been a citizen of the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand, or Australia for at least 10 years. We regret that we cannot make exceptions to this.

If you are interested in applying your AI skills to critical national security and intelligence challenges, we would love to hear from you.
