Unitary Foundation - Full-Stack Web Developer (Data visualization) - Open-source - Full-time - Remote (EU&#x2F;NA timezones) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitary.foundation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitary.foundation&#x2F;</a>

We&#x27;re a quantum computing non-profit organization, and we are looking for a full-stack web developer.

The job is classical — mostly building web portals — but those portals open into the quantum world.

Quantum computing knowledge is a plus, but not required. The initial project is a platform to understand the trajectory of quantum computing. The focus is on data visualization, so strong skills in that area are preferred. The candidate will work mostly alongside quantum engineers and researchers, so ownership to work independently on the classical side of things is important.

The stack of the main web project is PERN, but the organization maintains other projects in Python.
