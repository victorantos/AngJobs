Hi

This is Venkitesh, Founder and CEO of Nextoar.

At Nextoar, we&#x27;re building a neurosymbolic multi-agent Industrial AI platform that transforms hitech industries, semiconductor and electronics operations, augmenting technicians, engineers, and planners with intelligent assistants (AI Coach) for supply chain and manufacturing operational excellence.

We are honored to be selected as one of 35 global semi-finalists (and one of 4 from Asia) at SEMICON West 2025 in the Startups for Sustainable Semiconductors program:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semi.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;semi-startups-for-sustainable-semiconductors-committee-announces-semi-finalists?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=blog&amp;utm_term=s3_semi_finalists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semi.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;semi-startups-for-sustainable-...</a>

We are hiring a Founding CTO — someone who is a hands-on software engineer first, with strong AI intuition and a drive to build real, usable systems.

You might be a fit if:
• You have led high-caliber engineering teams, shipped distributed systems, and scaled SaaS platforms
• You write code and love building—whether it is backend architecture, model-serving infra, or an internal AI coding tool
• You are actively used LLMs and other AI tools to boost engineering productivity (e.g. prompt-chaining, agents, smart code review, AI-powered documentation, etc.)
• You have dabbled with (or are keen to grow into) AI-native product architecture—retrieval, reasoning, vision, agent or MCP frameworks
• You are a zero-to-one thinker, eager to own product + engineering, and work directly with the founder

We offer:
• Early leadership role with significant equity and long-term influence
• A rare opportunity to work on real-world, high-impact industrial AI problems
• Can explore hybrid setup (Bangalore preferred),
• Direct exposure to global semiconductor and electronics ecosystem and live customer deployments
To apply, write to me at vramadas [at] nextoar [dot] com with HN in the subject line.
