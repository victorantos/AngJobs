Continua - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai</a> - Multiple Roles - ONSITE (NYC&#x2F;Seattle) - Full-time

At Continua (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;</a>), we&#x27;ve built an AI agent that users can invite into group conversations to make planning, coordination, and information retrieval effortless, and we&#x27;re expanding our team. We&#x27;ve seen rapid growth over the last few months and want you to help us scale to the next level. Try adding our agent at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;</a> to group texts and kick the tires!

I’m David (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dpetrou&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dpetrou&#x2F;</a>), the founder and CEO. Before starting Continua, I was a Distinguished Software Engineer at Google. We’re backed by top-tier VCs and incredible angel investors. Our team is a fantastic bunch (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;team" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;team</a>) of accomplished engineers and researchers from Google, Slack, Disney, and several AI startups. We&#x27;re pretty clued in on the technology side and have a strong vision of how the transformative technology of the last few years along with our own secret sauce (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) can help a huge number of people.

We’re hiring for two positions:

Senior&#x2F;Staff Machine Learning Engineer (NYC or Seattle): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;continua&#x2F;f1d8fc3e-7092-486b-95c2-0684a1de0af2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;continua&#x2F;f1d8fc3e-7092-486b-95c2-06...</a>
You&#x27;ll work on building and improving the best LLM group chat experience there is, including fine-tuning models to boost conversational quality and improve scalability and identifying novel ways to build a &quot;memory&quot; which leads to a personalized and unique experience for our users. You&#x27;re an experienced machine learning engineer with broad knowledge and skills and have experience fine-tuning LLMs for both generative and discriminative use cases. You have a Master&#x27;s or PhD in Machine Learning (or a Bachelor’s with exceptional industry experience). You understand what it means to work at a fast-moving startup.

Product &amp; Growth Manager (NYC): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;continua&#x2F;c3bc02c4-9663-4d69-8731-89f045715986" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;continua&#x2F;c3bc02c4-9663-4d69-8731-89...</a>
You&#x27;re a technically minded PM that will drive go-to-market execution, user research, and feature development. You’ll run fast experiments, talk to users daily, and help us build the product roadmap based on real-world feedback and data. Ideal candidates have strong startup instincts, a technical background, and experience launching or growing AI products.

We offer competitive salary and equity, health benefits, 401k, and the opportunity to help shape the future of AI agents during one of the most exciting moments in computing history!
