SuperMe - Software Engineer - SF (In-Person) - Full-time -
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.superme.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.superme.ai</a>

We’re building the professional network for the AI age - think Perplexity meets LinkedIn, powered by expert-modeled AI profiles. Team is small (ex-Lyft, Whatnot, Pinterest, Eventbrite, ex-founders) and everyone codes (even our ops person). Our designer is cracked and ships production code regularly.

We&#x27;re looking for a product-minded engineer who like to work across the stack — spanning product, infrastructure, and ML. If you&#x27;re excited about the intersection of consumer and AI, we should chat.

Location: In-person in SF.
