Estuary - US Based &#x2F; Remote - Full-time – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;estuary.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;estuary.dev&#x2F;</a>

Estuary is a VC-backed startup building the next generation of real-time data infrastructure. Our platform, Estuary Flow, combines change data capture (CDC), stream processing, and declarative configuration to unify real-time and batch data movement.

We’re open-source, developer-first, and focused on making data engineering radically simpler.

We’re a small, high-trust team with deep experience in distributed systems, stream processing, and data tooling — and we’re growing quickly.

We’re hiring for:
Senior Backend Engineer (Integrations) – 5+ years of backend engineering experience. Own and scale high-impact systems that power real-time data pipelines. You’ll work on complex integrations with external APIs and databases, improve our internal connector frameworks, and tackle deep challenges in performance, reliability, and developer experience.

Backend Engineer (Integrations) – 2–4 years of backend experience. Help expand and maintain our catalog of real-time data connectors to SaaS tools using Python. You’ll work closely with experienced engineers to build and optimize integrations with third-party systems, while deepening your skills in infrastructure and stream processing.

Site Reliability Engineer - First SRE hire. Greenfield role owning reliability and scalability at Estuary. Build out automation, observability, and deployment pipelines, and lead incident response as we scale. Plenty of room to shape tooling and practices.

Solutions Engineer - Work with the founding team to help customers use Estuary effectively. Collaborate closely with engineering and product, shape how users integrate real-time data, and feed insights back into product development.

What we’re looking for:
Engineers who care about building reliable, maintainable systems and enjoy working with complex APIs and data flows. We value curiosity, clear communication, and a willingness to learn.

Bonus points for experience with CDC tools, open source contributions, or fast-paced startups.
