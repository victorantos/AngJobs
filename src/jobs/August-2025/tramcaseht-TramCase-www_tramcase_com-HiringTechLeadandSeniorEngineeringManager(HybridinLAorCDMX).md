Tram Case - www.tramcase.com- Hiring Tech Lead and Senior Engineering Manager (Hybrid in LA or CDMX) and Remote Engineers (LATAM) - Fluency in both Spanish and English is required for all roles.

We’re building software to help high-volume law firms handle their caseload more efficiently—starting with an AI assistant that transcribes and classifies inbound calls so teams can focus on what needs action. That system is already in use, and we’re now expanding into case tracking, follow-ups, and broader workflow automation.

We&#x27;re looking for a Tech Lead and Senior Engineering Manager based in Los Angeles or Mexico City (hybrid). You’ll work closely with the founders, lead a small team of senior engineers, and take ownership of key technical decisions. It’s a hands-on role with room to influence both product direction and team structure as we grow.

We’re also hiring senior backend, frontend, and AI engineers across LATAM (remote). You’ll be part of a tight, experienced team focused on building tools that solve real operational problems inside legal teams.

Our stack includes Python, JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript, Postgres, Kubernetes, and GCP.

If you&#x27;re looking for thoughtful engineering work in a fast-moving environment, we’d love to hear from you.
