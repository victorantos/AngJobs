LEA — Founding Engineer — Hybrid NYC (2–3 days&#x2F;week onsite) — Salary + Equity

Early stage Rails engineer wanted to build AI-driven enterprise wealth tools in NYC. Founding role, high ownership, direct impact.

We’re a seed-stage NYC startup reimagining how wealth management firms work. LEA extracts structured data from complex financial documents and automates workflows—handling everything from document organization to pushing clean data into CRMs and planning tools—so advisors can focus on clients instead of admin.

You’ll be the first technical hire, working directly with me (CTO&#x2F;co-founder) to ship features fast, shape our development culture, and integrate AI into our Rails + Postgres + Hotwire stack.

Tech stack: Ruby on Rails 7, Postgres, Hotwire, AI
Location: Hybrid NYC (onsite 2–3 days&#x2F;week)
Compensation: Competitive salary + meaningful equity
