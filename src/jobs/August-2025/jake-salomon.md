Hi, I’m Jake — I lead startup recruiting at Roc. Over the past year, we&#x27;ve helped 48 founding engineers land roles at high-growth startups in SF and NY.

Right now, we’re working with several seed to Series B companies hiring TypeScript and AI&#x2F;full-stack engineers. If you&#x27;re exploring what’s next, I’d love to connect and share what we’re seeing in the market.
