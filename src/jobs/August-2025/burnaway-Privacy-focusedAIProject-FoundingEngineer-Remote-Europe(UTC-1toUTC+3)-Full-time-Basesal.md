Privacy-focused AI Project - Founding Engineer - Remote - Europe (UTC-1 to UTC+3) - Full-time - Base salary + Up to 4% equity

We are building a truly private, open-source LLM gateway with outstanding user experience to address privacy problems around using LLMs. When we interact with AI-based services, we face the fundamental tension between utility and privacy. Current solutions to this problem are inadequate, so we are ready to build what we couldn&#x27;t find.

Who are we? A well-funded, bootstrapped venture by the founders of IVPN - a VPN service highly regarded by privacy advocates and analysts, in operation since 2009.

We are looking for a Founding Engineer (based in Europe) to architect and build an MVP from the ground up. This is a role for a senior builder with:

- At least 8 years of professional experience

- Demonstrable history of solo-shipping products

- Deep expertise across the stack (e.g., Go&#x2F;Rust for backend, React&#x2F;Vue for frontend)

- Strong security and infrastructure automation mindset

What you can expect:

- Founder-funded, sovereign startup = no VCs and external pressure

- Small, dedicated, 100% remote team that prefers pragmatism and maximum autonomy.

- Complete technical ownership, responsible for building a system designed for high availability and verifiable privacy.

- Sole focus on engineering - zero distractions. Founders own strategy, functional requirements, design, communications, legal and all other business related decision and execution.

- Strong salary and a significant, foundational equity stake (up to 4%).

If you&#x27;re a self-directed, experienced engineer who wants to build the foundational infrastructure for private, trustworthy AI access, email me at viktor at ivpn.net for a one-page project brief.
