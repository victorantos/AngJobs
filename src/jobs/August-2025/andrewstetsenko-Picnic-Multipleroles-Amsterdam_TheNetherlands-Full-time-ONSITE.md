Picnic - Multiple roles - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full-time - ONSITE - Visa Sponsorship &amp; Relocation Support

Take the lead on projects that power Europe&#x27;s most advanced grocery delivery tech. And without the grind of Big Tech or chaos of early-stage startups.

Picnic now delivers groceries to millions of people across three countries and is growing quickly. This includes the tech team, which is at the core of everything from product development (mobile app, store backend, internal dev platforms, etc.) to last-mile delivery optimization using machine learning.

Everything is built in-house, and many of their solutions are open-sourced.

Youâ€™ll solve real engineering problems at scale - while shaping the systems millions rely on every week.
