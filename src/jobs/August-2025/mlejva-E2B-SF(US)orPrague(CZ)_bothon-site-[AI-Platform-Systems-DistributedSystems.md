E2B - SF (US) or Prague (CZ), both on-site - [AI - Platform - Systems - Distributed Systems - Customer] Engineer&#x2F;DevRel Engineer&#x2F;Head of Engineering - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2b.dev&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2b.dev&#x2F;careers</a>

E2B is an open-source infra devtool that gives AI agents cloud computers that we call sandboxes.

We&#x27;re Series A startup with 7+ figures revenue. We&#x27;ve raised over $32M and have customers like Perplexity, Hugging Face, Manus, or Groq. We&#x27;re growing double digits (sometimes triple digits) every month, have 5+ years of runway, and a full roadmap of exciting features to build.

I&#x27;d love to chat if you want to help us with some of the scaling challenges, DX, or new products!

Feel free to send me your projects to vasek[at]e2b.dev.
