Solace Health - Full-Stack - Remote (US Only)

I realize it&#x27;s hard to tell these days what jobs are &quot;real&quot; but make no mistake - we&#x27;re hiring aggressively.

About Solace:

The U.S. healthcare system wasn’t built for patients. It’s massive, confusing, exhausting, and designed to wear people down. It denies access, withholds clarity, fails to take patients seriously, and rarely shows them how to fix what’s broken.

At Solace, we’re on a mission to empower patients &amp; improve outcomes.

By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes.

We&#x27;re a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully-remote U.S. team distributed coast-to-coast.
