Hellas.AI - Remote - Full Time or Contract - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellas.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellas.ai</a>

Hellas.AI is building a compiler for categorical deep learning to power decentralised, serverless AI.

We&#x27;re looking for an experienced Rust engineer. You must have demonstrated:

* Experience in designing and implementing BFT consensus protocols
* Ability to engage with academic literature on distributed systems
* Understanding of ZK proofs and proof aggregation (you don&#x27;t need to design these, but you should know how to use them)

Nice-to-have: interest or experience in:

* Deep Learning &#x2F; ML &#x2F; AI, GPU programming
* Compilers and array programming languages
* Category Theory and string diagrams

If you have project(s) demonstrating your experience in one or more of these areas, get in touch!

Our process is simple: we read code you&#x27;ve written and research you&#x27;ve published, then interview you about it. We don&#x27;t do tedious coding tests.
