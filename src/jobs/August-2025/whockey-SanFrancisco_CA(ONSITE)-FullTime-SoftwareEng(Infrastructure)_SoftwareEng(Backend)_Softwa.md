Column (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;column.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;column.com&#x2F;</a>) - San Francisco, CA (ONSITE) - Full Time - Software Eng (Infrastructure), Software Eng (Backend), Software Eng (Product)

Column is building the infrastructure that powers the US dollar globally. We own a nationally chartered bank that we&#x27;ve built from the ground up. We&#x27;re currently processing trillions of dollars annually, supporting some of the largest and most sophisticated companies out there like Wise, Bilt, Brex, Ramp, Mercury and dozens of others.

Previous to this I started Plaid (plaid.com), and at Column I&#x27;m focused on keeping an extremely lean and experienced team. We&#x27;re currently 10 experienced engineers that all report to me. We are looking for an ambitious infrastructure, product, and backend engineer (one of each) that wants to build incredible software from first principles.
