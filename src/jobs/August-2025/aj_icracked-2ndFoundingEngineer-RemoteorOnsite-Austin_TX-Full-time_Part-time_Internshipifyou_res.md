Coop (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smart.coop.farm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smart.coop.farm</a>)- 2nd Founding Engineer - Remote or Onsite - Austin, TX - Full-time, Part-time, Internship if you’re scrappy

My name is AJ Forsythe and I&#x27;m the Founder &#x2F; Chief Chicken Tender at Coop! We&#x27;re an Austin TX based company on a mission to build the world’s largest decentralized food production network, starting with AI powered chicken Coops.  We’ve been in the market for about 18 months and our customers are in 48 states and will generate about &gt;5M eggs this year. It&#x27;s insanely fun to work on and we have a shot at building a huge business in the connected urban farming space. If you’re big into computer vision, consumer products that are fun, and an awesome team we would love to chat. The Coop has an automatic door + cameras doing computer vision work (predator detection, egg alerts, remote health monitoring, etc). It&#x27;s a super exciting time and are seeing directional product market fit which I&#x27;m thrilled about. Seriously go check out our website, it&#x27;s a super fun + amazing product.

We’re a tight-knit team of 6 people with 15+ years of experience working together. We’ve been through YC, started and scaled multinational million-dollar businesses together, taking them from idea to acquisition by a Fortune 50 company. We’re gritty and passionate without taking ourselves too seriously - and we’re here to build something really exciting that helps people reconnect with their food and the planet. We&#x27;re VC backed (call it $5M) by some of the world&#x27;s best investors but we are a scrappy small team that moves fast.

We have an absolutely fantastic CTO Ryan that I&#x27;m looking for his &#x2F; our right hand person to work alongside with. I think the term full stack is overused but that&#x27;s closest to what we&#x27;re looking for. Also this really isn’t a traditional Eng role, I look at it as we’re a small growing team and you would be one of us working on a ton a cool projects on day 1. Also, we LOVE working with founders so if you&#x27;ve started a company before that&#x27;s epic.

You can also reach out to me directly at: aj[at]coop.farm - Just email me your LinkedIn &#x2F; GitHub &#x2F; portfolio + why you think you&#x27;ll be an awesome fit and I&#x27;ll respond. This is my 3rd company (2 have exited) and I want to build the super solid core team and you might be the perfect fit for us and vice versa.

Bwok Bwok!
