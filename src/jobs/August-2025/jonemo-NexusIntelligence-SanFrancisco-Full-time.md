Founding Software Engineer — Accelerate and elevate our software development work. You&#x27;ll be working ~50&#x2F;50 between improving existing software (PLC programming copilot, web app, LLM agent) and building new features and products from scratch. Exceptional full stack software development skills are required, preferably with strong Typescript&#x2F;React&#x2F;Node experience. Experience with manufacturing&#x2F;controls is not required but would be a plus.

I&#x27;m Jonas, lead architect at Nexus Intelligence. We’re a software startup backed by a16z that’s building industrial automation systems for companies at the forefront of the US manufacturing renaissance. Our initial product is an agent-based platform for developing &amp; operating legacy control systems, a set of platforms critical to automotive, food, energy, and other industrial sectors. Our vision is to bring AI-enabled workflows, development tools, languages, and runtimes into the manufacturing ecosystem - ultimately becoming the platform on which all modern industrial automation processes are built and deployed.

The team currently consists of Chris (CEO and founder, previously at Tesla, Stanford CS &amp; MBA) and myself (automated biotech labs at Zymergen and Counsyl, dev tools at AWS, Cornell PhD). The first version of our product is in use by customers. You&#x27;d join us for the exciting and fast-paced 0 → 1 phase of company building. You’ll need to strongly believe in our mission, welcome the challenge of ambiguity, and iterate fast.

If this particular role doesn&#x27;t quite fit your interests, we also have a General Application form on the same careers page. Email: jonas@getnexus.ai
