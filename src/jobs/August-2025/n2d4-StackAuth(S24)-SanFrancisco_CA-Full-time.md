Stack Auth (S24) - San Francisco, CA - Full-time

Hiring design &amp; founding engineers! We&#x27;re building the customer platform for developers â€” think of a single service that does auth, payments, analytics, marketing emails, and so much more.

If you&#x27;re in San Francisco and frequent Hacker News, that&#x27;s enough of a reason to DM me on Twitter @konstiwohlwend! Would love to invite you over for a coffee at our hacker house :)
