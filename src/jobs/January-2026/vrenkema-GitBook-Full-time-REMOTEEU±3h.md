GitBook - Full-time - REMOTE (EU ±3h) - Product Engineers &amp; Solutions Engineers

Hey HN!  We’re GitBook — building the next generation of documentation and knowledge tools used by teams and engineers worldwide to create, organize, and publish docs, decent change you&#x27;ve visited docs in the past that are created through us! Our platform combines a modern editor, collaborative workflows, and AI-native capabilities to help teams ship better docs faster — whether that’s API references, product guides, internal knowledge, or user support content.

We’re a small, fully remote team (~35 people across ~13 countries) with a bias toward async work, autonomy, and impact. We meet a few times a year in person for offsites, support flexible schedules, and invest in great tools and setups for everyone.

Open roles (remote EU ±3h):
 • Product Engineer — help build core parts of our product experience and platform.   
 • Solutions Engineer — work with customers to understand needs, build solutions on GitBook, and drive adoption.
