Microsoft Research is hiring Senior MLE&#x27;s in Cambridge, MA (ONSITE).

Responsibilities include the training of generative models and anything that contributes to the betterment of their capabilities -- profiling &#x2F; optimizing their throughput, scaling training runs, tuning of hyperparameters &#x2F; data mixes, etc. If it makes the model better, it&#x27;s fair game!

Depending on the project, you will likely be involved in some combination of AR model training, diffusion model training, midtraining, post-training, multimodal training, etc.

As you can likely surmise, we&#x27;re looking for folks who are flexible and comfortable wearing many hats. If this sounds like you and you&#x27;re interested in working in a research environment, consider applying!
