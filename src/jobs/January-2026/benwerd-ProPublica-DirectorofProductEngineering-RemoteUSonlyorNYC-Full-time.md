ProPublica - Director of Product Engineering - Remote (US only) or NYC - Full-time

ProPublica is a non-profit newsroom that investigates abuses of trust in the public interest. Journalism we published last year shed light on the impact of DOGE and ICE, investigated right-wing militias, told stories about the US medical system, and more. Here were our most-read stories in 2025: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;propublica-most-read-stories-2025" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;propublica-most-read-stor...</a>

I&#x27;m the Senior Director of Technology. I&#x27;m hiring a pragmatic, mission-driven Director of Product Engineering, who will report to me, in order to provide more support for our product engineers who work on our publishing and data products. (This is *not* a reporting position.) You&#x27;ll directly lead and manage a small team of engineers and help us to create and maintain great engineering processes.

Or get in touch with me at ben.werdmuller [at] propublica.org if you&#x27;d like to have a conversation about it.

The expected salary range for this position is $170,000 to $180,000. We cannot sponsor visas and must hire in the US. The role is almost fully remote: we have two in-person week-long summits a year.
