We’re evolving the architecture of a mission-critical justice platform and looking for a hands-on Principal Engineer.

We are looking for a track record of reducing complexity and an appreciation for databases as foundational pillars of correct applications.

We value engineering judgement over specific frameworks—if you’re a great engineer who can ramp up quickly we want to talk.
