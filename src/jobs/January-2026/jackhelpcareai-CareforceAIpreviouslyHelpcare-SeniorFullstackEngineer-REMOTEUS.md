Description: Careforce AI is building autonomous AI agents that eliminate the manual administrative burden in healthcare (fax machines, scheduling, calling). We find, call, and schedule patients, breaking interoperability barriers that have plagued the industry for 40 years. We are a well-funded, YC-backed company with massive customer demand.

We are looking for a Senior Fullstack Engineer to be a foundational member of our small, ambitious team. You will have significant ownership working across the stack to build and scale the core of our AI agent platform. We are looking for builders with 5+ years of experience, preferably with an early-stage startup background (Pre-seed to Series A).
