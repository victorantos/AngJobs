Shorebird - Mid-Senior C++&#x2F;Runtime OR Dart&#x2F;Cloud Engineers - REMOTE (North America) - Full-time - $150-230k + equity + benefits - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shorebird.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shorebird.dev</a>

Flutter&#x2F;Shorebird founder here. Flutter is used by millions of devs (and nearly ⅓ of free apps submitted to AppStore), but is missing services for businesses. We offer Flutter-related SAAS used by 1000s businesses globally, on track to profitability early 2026.

As part of our over-the-air updates “code push” product, we’ve built a custom compiler and runtime for the Dart language, primarily written by me (founder&#x2F;CEO). We need a fulltime engineer to take over primary responsibility for all of our C++ code (Dart &amp; Flutter forks, custom runtime, compiler, etc.) and evolve it further than I could alone.  You don’t need to be a compiler&#x2F;runtime expert. You do need to be capable of working on large open source projects, be comfortable with C++, want to work at a startup, work well independently (we’re remote) and want to learn and work on lots of different areas of code.  If you’ve contributed at least a little to WebKit, Godot, Firefox, or any other open source project and are at least compiler&#x2F;runtime curious, you will likely find this role extremely rewarding.

For our second role: we serve 10s of millions of devices daily from our cloud, (2k+ RPS sustained), built mostly in Dart on Google Cloud + CloudFlare.  We’re in the process of launching a CI product and have a lot of cloud development work ahead of us.  You need some cloud experience, want to work at a startup, and be willing to work in Dart (what our customers use).

We’re a small, senior team, making something people want. Tech: GCP, Cloudflare, React, Dart, C++, Rust.  Shorebird operates almost entirely in the public over Discord. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;shorebird" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;shorebird</a>
