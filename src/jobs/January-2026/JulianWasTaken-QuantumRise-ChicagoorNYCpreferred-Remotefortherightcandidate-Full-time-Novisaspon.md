Quantum Rise - Chicago or NYC (preferred), Remote for the right candidate - Full-time - No visa sponsorship - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantumrise.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantumrise.com&#x2F;</a>

Quantum Rise is an AI-forward consulting startup serving the middle market, across multiple industries. Clearly many companies are struggling to understand how to leverage artificial intelligence in their day-to-day operations, to understand what their existing workforce now needs to know, or to understand whether they&#x27;re about to be disrupted. Many have business problems which &quot;traditional&quot; machine learning could help with even before the current GenAI hype cycle, but for whatever reason hadn&#x27;t prioritized doing so until now. We try and help getting a handle around these issues and designing outcome-driven solutions.

Agentic AI Solutions Manager: You&#x27;ll work directly with clients to benchmark, train and deploy agentic systems for industry-specific problems. We&#x27;re looking for someone deeply curious about agentic systems across vendors and platforms. Companies are looking for ways to leverage agentic systems to upskill their practitioners. This is a front-facing development role for someone who loves both tech and tackling real business problems.
