Founding Engineer @ Conductor (San Francisco, ONSITE)

Conductor lets you run a team of coding agents on your Mac. We launched in July through Show HN, and are used by engineers at companies like Linear, Vercel, Notion, Stripe, and YC.

We’re on a mission to build the human interface to AI organizations. We’re a team of four looking for one or two more exceptional engineers or designers.
No AI experience needed, just some enthusiasm for the awesome alien power of LLMs.
