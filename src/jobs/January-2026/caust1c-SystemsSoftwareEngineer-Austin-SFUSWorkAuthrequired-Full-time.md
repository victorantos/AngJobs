RunReveal (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runreveal.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runreveal.com</a>) - Systems Software Engineer - Austin, SF (US Work Auth required) - Full-time

RunReveal is the Security Data Platform that&#x27;s building tools to help companies detect and respond to threats in their network.  We&#x27;re a team that values speed, quality and curiosity.  Our stack is Go, NextJS (TS), Postgres and ClickHouse.  We believe that companies should be able to own their security data and get value out of it too and so we&#x27;ve built a platform that can be deployed anywhere.  SIEM sucks, so we&#x27;re here to fix it.

If you&#x27;re into self hosting or running a homelab, or you&#x27;re using LLMs to enhance your development workflow and extend your knowledge and not just regurgitate slop, or you&#x27;re always looking for opportunities for self improvement, you&#x27;re in good company at RunReveal.

We&#x27;ve got phenomenal customers like Cursor, Harvey, Temporal, Linear, DigitalOcean, ClickHouse and AngelList among many others that we work with on a daily basis to improve the product.

We&#x27;re especially interested in folks that have experience working with petabyte scale databases.  We use ClickHouse, but experience with other similar large scale data technologies like Iceberg, Flink, Spark, ScyllaDB, Cassandra, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, BadgerDB etc would also be valuable.

Reach out to me via alan at the company domain and mention hn who&#x27;s hiring January &#x27;26 in the subject line.
