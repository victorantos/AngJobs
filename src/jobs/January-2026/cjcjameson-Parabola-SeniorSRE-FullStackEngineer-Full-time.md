Parabola - Senior SRE + Full Stack Engineer - NYC&#x2F;SF ONSITE-Hybrid - Full-time

We&#x27;re building the AI-powered workflow automation platform that ops and finance teams at Lyft, Flexport, WHOOP, 1000+ other companies use to turn their business logic into executable workflows. They&#x27;re dealing with messy reality: PDFs, emails, spreadsheets, APIs scattered across systems. We let non-technical teams build production-grade automation by describing what they need in plain English.

Senior SRE: Join our platform team keeping the foundation solid as we scale. Own reliability, security, and developer experience for a multi-tenant system handling 100+ integrations. You&#x27;ll be on-call, but working on genuinely interesting problems: making deploys boring, keeping customer workflows running, building infrastructure that compounds. Best fit if you care about enabling teams, not just managing pipes.

Senior Full Stack Product Engineer: Own entire features from idea to production. Build interfaces that make complex automation accessible to people who&#x27;ve never written code. Current problems: LLM-powered workflow generation, extracting structure from chaos (PDFs, emails, weird APIs), real-time collaboration on live data pipelines.
The companies winning with AI in 2026 are the ones who made their business logic explicit and their context connected. We&#x27;re building the layer that makes that possible.
