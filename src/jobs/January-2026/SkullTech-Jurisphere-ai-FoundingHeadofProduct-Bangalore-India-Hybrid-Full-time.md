Jurisphere.ai - Founding Head of Product - Bangalore, India - Hybrid - Full-time

We’re building an enterprise AI platform for the legal industry. Bootstrapped to $1M ARR with a team of ~20, recently raised our first institutional round.

We’re hiring our first Product leader to take over from the founders and own the roadmap end-to-end. This is not a wrapper; we’re building complex, multi-step AI workflows, document reasoning systems, and audit-heavy enterprise software for top-tier law firms and corporates.

Profile:

• 6–10+ years. We care more about output density than titles.

• Background in B2B SaaS &#x2F; DevTools &#x2F; workflow or platform products.

• Has owned large product areas or whole products end-to-end.

• Technical enough to discuss things like RAG evaluation and LLM latency.

• High-agency: you’ll decide what we build and what we don’t.

Not a fit if: you’re a process-only &#x2F; Jira-first &#x2F; bigco PM.

Comp: ₹40L–₹70L base + meaningful equity. Strong growth as we scale from $1M to $5M+ ARR.

Apply: sumit@jurisphere.ai. Short intro + links to things you’ve built helps.
