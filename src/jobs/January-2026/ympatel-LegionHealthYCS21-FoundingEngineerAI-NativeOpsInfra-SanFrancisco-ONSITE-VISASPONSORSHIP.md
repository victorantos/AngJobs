We have $3M+ ARR, $7M+ raised, and our infrastructure currently supports 2,000+ patients with only one human support lead.

We&#x27;re hiring a Founding Engineer to own our backend and agent systems end-to-end. This is not a &quot;wrapper&quot; role; you will be architecting the state machines and event streams that turn clinical intent into reliable operations.

Build AI Co-workers: Implement agents with tool use, memory, and safety rails that act as trustworthy teammates for clinicians.

Event-Driven Architecture: Design the schemas and workflows (Node.js&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;Postgres) that encode how psychiatric care operates.

High Impact: Your work lands in real clinical workflows immediately, directly improving patient access and care quality.

Tech Stack: Node.js, TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres), AWS (ECS&#x2F;Lambda), Next.js 15, OpenAI&#x2F;Anthropic.

Offer:

Comp: $130k–$190k base + significant early equity (0.2%–0.8%).

Location: San Francisco (In-person).

Process: Intro -&gt; Systems Deep Dive -&gt; Practical Work Trial (No Leetcode) -&gt; Onsite. We move fast (7-10 days).
