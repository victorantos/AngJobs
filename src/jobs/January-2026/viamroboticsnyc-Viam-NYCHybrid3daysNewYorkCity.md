Viam - Senior &amp; Staff Engineers Backend Engineers - NYC Hybrid 3 days (New York City) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viam.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viam.com&#x2F;</a>

Viam (founded by former co-founder&#x2F;long-time CTO of MongodDB) is an open source robotics + AI developer platform. It is a single platform that brings software engineering maturity to robotics and automation.

Why this could be interesting to you: 
Impact: ~100 people (~70 engineers) with only a handful at Staff level → huge room for influence.

Proven, technical founder (MongoDB): → scaling with traction and real customers.

Tech: Backend-focused teams (Core Services, Infrastructure, Motion Planning, Platform&#x2F;Server) using Golang, MongoDB, Linux, GCP.

Timing: Early enough to shape core architecture, late enough to see meaningful usage and scale.
