Gobii AI - Senior Software Engineer - REMOTE (US) - gobii.ai

Gobii is the easiest way to deploy browser-use agents in the cloud or on-premises. We&#x27;re building an open-core AI workforce platform—browser-native agents and automation tools. We have paying customers.

The entire team contributes to browser-use. We also have contributors to Apache NiFi, LiteLLM, and RA.Aid (open-source coding agent I created). Open source is core to how we build and how we think. We&#x27;re backed by Open Core Ventures.

HQ is San Francisco, but much of the team is in the DC area. East Coast timezone preferred, DC area even better—but we&#x27;re fully remote.

What we&#x27;re building: The orchestration layer for browser-use and AI agents. Systems that navigate, reason, and execute on the real web.

Who we&#x27;re looking for: You&#x27;ve built agentic systems that shipped to production. You have opinions about tool use, context management, and why most &quot;agents&quot; are just glorified prompt chains. You strongly prefer working in the open—a significant part of this role is contributing to OSS repos. We strongly prefer candidates with existing open source contributions.

Why now: We have strong traction and are expanding the team. You&#x27;d be early—with real influence over product, architecture, and how we work. High autonomy, high trust, small team of people who know what they&#x27;re doing.

Comp: Cash + healthcare + modest 401k match + options. In line with SF-based VC-backed startups at pre-seed stage.

Stack: TypeScript, Python, browser automation, LLM orchestration.
