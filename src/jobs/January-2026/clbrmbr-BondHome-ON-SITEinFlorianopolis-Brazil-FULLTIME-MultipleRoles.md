Bond Home - ON-SITE in Florianopolis, Brazil - FULL TIME - Multiple Roles

We are building smart outdoor living spaces.

Come work with a cracked team, in-person, building primarily for the US market.

Interested to hear from talented: firmware engineers (C), mobile (iOS&#x2F;Android native), backend (Python), UX designers, &amp; quality engineers.

We&#x27;re heavy users of agentic coding (Claude), looking particularly for engineers who can scale their output with increased access to compute, while being meticulous about security &amp; quality.

Hiring exclusively in Brazil. Must be in or willing to relocate to Santa Catarina. We have an office right by UFSC. We work with a lot of hardware and so an in-office culture is efficient.

Some travel to USA required.
