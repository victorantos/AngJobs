Estuary is a VC-backed, post–Series A startup powering right-time data replication and transform — from sub-second CDC replication to terabyte-scale OLAP data flows.

We’re open-source, developer-first, and focused on making data movement radically simpler across both our Platform and Applications layers.

We’re hiring for:

Senior &amp; Staff Backend Engineers (Integrations)

5+ years backend experience; Go required, Rust a plus. Own core systems powering real-time data pipelines. Build complex API&#x2F;database integrations, improve connector frameworks, and tackle deep challenges in performance, reliability, and developer experience.

Backend Engineer (Integrations) – 2–4 years of backend experience. Help expand and maintain our catalog of real-time data connectors to SaaS tools using Python. You’ll work closely with experienced engineers to build and optimize integrations with third-party systems, while deepening your skills in infrastructure and stream processing.

Solutions Engineer - Work with the founding team to help customers use Estuary effectively. Collaborate closely with engineering and product, shape how users integrate real-time data, and feed insights back into product development.

What we’re looking for: Engineers who care about building reliable, maintainable systems and enjoy working with complex APIs and data flows. We value curiosity, clear communication, and a willingness to learn.

Bonus points for experience with CDC tools, open source contributions, or fast-paced startups.
