CareIgnition - Senior Software Engineer (Generalist) - REMOTE, Chicago (US Only)

Medical billing in America is a black box of fragmented data and inefficiency. At CareIgnition, we are building the transparency layer for healthcare. We transform massive, messy datasets into financial clarity for employers and providers.

We are looking for a pragmatic generalist. You’ll be working across the entire stack: from building customer-facing features in React and Django to architecting data pipelines that process petabytes of medical claims and rates. Crucially, this role involves deep algorithmic and analytical work. You won&#x27;t just move data; you will implement the logic that makes sense of it.

We value &quot;generalist&quot; DNA—engineers who are as comfortable optimizing a SQL query as they are building a clean UI component. If you enjoy solving high-scale data problems that have a direct impact on healthcare affordability, we’d love to talk.

Tech: Python, Django, React, AWS (ECS, Step Functions, Athena), SQL (DuckDB&#x2F;Polars), Iceberg&#x2F;Redshift.
