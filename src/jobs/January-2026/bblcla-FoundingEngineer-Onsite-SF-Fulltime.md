Stardrift (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardrift.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardrift.ai</a>) - Founding Engineer - Onsite - SF - Full time

Hi HN - I&#x27;m the founder of Stardrift, and we&#x27;re looking for a founding engineer to join our team of 3.

We are building a world-class travel agent experience. In the future, you won’t book travel by opening ten tabs in Google Flights; you’ll book through a personalized AI assistant that understands everything about you and automatically arranges your trip for you.

You&#x27;ll tackle everything from optimizing LLM performance and building evals to integrating with APIs for rail and flight networks around the world. We care about moving fast and writing high-quality code; your job will be to take customer feedback and improve our product, working with me &amp; the rest of the founding team.

Here&#x27;s a tech blog we wrote about some of the systems engineering we do: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardrift.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;streaming-resumptions">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardrift.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;streaming-resumptions</a>.
