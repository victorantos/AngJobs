MiLaboratories - Bilbao, Spain - ONSITE - VISA SPONSORSHIP - RELOCATION SUPPORT

We are MiLaboratories, the team behind Platforma.bio &amp; MiXCR. We are building the &quot;OS for Biology&quot;—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development.

We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration.

We are hiring for two core roles:

1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale.

2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology.

The Offer:

Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k).

Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the &quot;Special Impatriate Regime&quot; (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions).

The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin.

Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a &quot;nice to have.&quot;

Relocation: Comprehensive &quot;Soft Landing&quot; package (Visa, temporary housing, school search).

Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living.

Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team.
