Bevyl - Founding Engineer &#x2F; AI Engineer - NYC &#x2F; open to remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevyl.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevyl.ai&#x2F;</a>
Bevyl is a seed-funded startup building AI-powered content creation tools for consumer brands. We&#x27;re making it possible for brands to produce high-quality social media content at scale without agencies or massive creative teams. The other competitors in the market are laughably bad, and we have a chance to build something really powerful on the cutting edge of what&#x27;s possible.

You&#x27;ll work with me (CTO, ex-Airbnb&#x2F;Loom&#x2F;Hightouch) to build key parts of our video + AI tooling. Video is hard, and we need to move fast to win. We have real customers, a lot to build, and strong conviction in our space. This is genuinely a very fun project and I&#x27;m looking to build my core team.

Stack: TypeScript, React + Tanstack, PostgreSQL, Supabase, AI pipelines. Competitive salary and significant early-stage equity

You: Early startup experience, willingness to hustle, love for product, comfort with ambiguity &amp; startup pace
