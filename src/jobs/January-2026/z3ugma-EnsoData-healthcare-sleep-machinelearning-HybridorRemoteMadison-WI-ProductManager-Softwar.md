Sleep is vital to recharging mentally, restoring our bodies physically, and fighting off disease. Sleep is so core to our health that it&#x27;s the activity we all spend most of our life doing.
Yet sleep disorders are some of the most underdiagnosed health conditions on the planet, with an estimated 80% of obstructive sleep apnea patients undiagnosed and untreated

EnsoData uses machine learning, integration with pulse oximeter hardware, mobile apps, and clinician review UIs to automate sleep study scoring and give sleep clinicians tools to find and help patients with sleep disorders.

We&#x27;re hiring a product manager to uncover what features our customers crave most, conduct discovery research in the sleep industry, define and prioritize product requirements, partner with engineers to ship features, and work with marketers to tell compelling product stories. You&#x27;ll manage the product development process from whiteboard mockups tested with real users through to detailed specs and launch, breaking down ambiguous problems into releasable slices that bring AI-powered sleep diagnosis to more patients.
