Prophet Town LLC - Various Software Engineering Roles - US – Remote and Hybrid - English fluency required - Full-time - $150K-$250K annual total comp (multiple)

I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a people-first, fully-remote, boutique indie tech agency – building a team of talented, high integrity, and community-minded individuals first, then building businesses around them. Our leadership staff are ex-Fortune 100; everybody touches code. Notable recent projects: internal tools for Anduril, and the auction system for voltagepark.com.

We’re currently especially seeking:

Full-Stack Software Engineers
(React, NextJS, Ruby on Rails; Typescript, Python; Database Design, Devops, and third-party API integrations)

IoT Developers
(Python, MQTT, GraphQL, AWS, Test Infrastructure)

Please apply using this Google Form: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;Dxpj7eTwcHpjiGT39" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;Dxpj7eTwcHpjiGT39</a>.  Applicants who submit before January 15 will typically receive a reply by January 31. Tier3 roles are typically 5-10 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e with $150-$175k annual total comp. Tier4 roles are 11-20 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e, $210-$250k annual total comp. Higher tiers exist, and we welcome exceptional applications.

REGARDING DECEMBER - if you already submitted to last December&#x27;s post, and haven&#x27;t heard from us yet, we&#x27;re still getting to you.  The team&#x27;s been working really hard over the last year, and I unexpectedly gave most of the folks helping me with job submissions the time off at the end of December &#x2F; beginning of January.  Apologies for the delay, and we will be with you soon.  Rest assured there are jobs we&#x27;re trying to fill - in fact, more than ever, it seems.
