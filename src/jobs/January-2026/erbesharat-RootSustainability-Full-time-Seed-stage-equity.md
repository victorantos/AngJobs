Root Sustainability - Senior UX&#x2F;UI Designer - REMOTE&#x2F;The Netherlands (or hybrid) - Full-time - Seed-stage + equity

We’re Root Sustainability, helping retail brands to turn scattered, incomplete operational data into auditable, high-granularity sustainability insights, and we’re doing it from the bottom up. Think tens of millions of data points, messy ERP exports, complex supply chains, and sustainability logic that most tools can’t handle. Our goal is to make all of that feel simple, clear, and usable for the people who rely on it every day.

Role:

You’ll own UX&#x2F;UI end-to-end: research, flows, wireframes, prototypes, and polished interfaces that make complicated domains feel obvious. You care about usability, accessibility, and simplicity in the face of ambiguity. You work closely with product and engineering, not as a service, but as a partner shaping what we build next.

What you’ll do:

Lead design for key features: mapping, dashboards, workflows.

Turn fuzzy sustainability domain problems into clear, user-centered interfaces.

Build prototypes and run lightweight user testing to validate assumptions.

Maintain and evolve a design system (Figma, etc.).

Collaborate closely with engineers, you’ll be shipping frequently, not just handing off specs.

You should apply if:

You have ~5+ yrs experience in UX&#x2F;UI with a strong portfolio.

You’re pragmatic: prioritize clarity over trends, iteration over perfection.

You thrive in early-stage environments where priorities shift quickly.

You know design systems, user research, and can defend your decisions.

Bonus: data viz experience, sustainability passion, accessibility chops.

Perks:

€60,000 – €70,000 gross per year with stock options.

Remote-friendly &#x2F; hybrid with occasional meetups.

Direct impact, your work shapes product direction.

Flat culture; work with a small, mission-driven team.
