Baserow is an open-source no-code database platform (Airtable alternative) for building databases, internal apps, and workflows.

You’ll work with prospects + customers to translate real processes into Baserow solutions: data modeling (tables&#x2F;relations), demos&#x2F;POCs, production-ready setups, integrations&#x2F;APIs, best practices, and feedback to product&#x2F;engineering. Also help with docs&#x2F;onboarding and first-line support for support-contract customers.
