AREO - Remote (EU) - Full-Time - Equity - Roles: [Engineering Manager (Ruby on Rails), Lead Product Engineer (Ruby on Rails), Senior Android Developer]

My name is Marius and I am the CTO at AREO (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goareo.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goareo.com&#x2F;</a>).

AREO, founded in January 2023 by a team with 20+ years of combined experience in retail and startups, is a young startup specializing in developing innovative solutions for supermarkets and grocery retail stores. Our cutting-edge B2B SaaS platform optimizes workflows for employees by providing real-time access to inventory, product information, and customer inquiries. We serve large supermarket chains in Germany and across the EU.

About a year ago we brought a backend developer on board through &quot;HN - Who is hiring&quot; and are now seeking a Lead Product Engineer &#x2F; Engineering Manager and a Senior Android Developer with a minimum of 8 years of experience (preferably in startups) as we just closed another 1M+ ARR contract with a major retail chain and are growing quickly.

For the Product Engineer &#x2F; Engineering Manager (but not the Android Developer) role professional knowledge of German is highly preferred.

If you&#x27;re passionate about building innovative retail products from scratch, these roles are for you.

Backend Stack: Ruby &#x2F; Rails (8.x), StimulusJS &#x2F; Hotwire &#x2F; Turbo, AlpineJS, Postgres, Docker, DigitalOcean, OpenAPI, LLMs

Mobile Stack: Kotlin, Room, Jetpack Compose, Hilt

Perks: Fully remote roles (Europe), work where you are most productive, sizeable equity in a rapidly growing company, flat hierarchies, no-ego work environment, work in a lean but highly experienced team
