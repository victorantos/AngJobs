WireScreen (Series A) - Senior Software Engineer - NYC - hybrid - Full-time - $165k-$210k base + equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;wirescreen&#x2F;e9d8e7e3-c737-43ee-8c7e-35a38007a0f1?utm_source=xgRXlw271G" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;wirescreen&#x2F;e9d8e7e3-c737-43ee-8c7e-...</a>

WireScreen is a fast-growing Sequoia-backed Series A startup building the go-to open source intelligence platform for navigating global supply chains and China-related risk. While China maintains some of the world’s most detailed corporate ownership records, the real challenge is connecting the dots. That’s where we come in—surfacing the networks, relationships, and financial ties behind companies to support national security, compliance, and regulatory oversight.

We’re looking for senior software engineers to build our data platform and help us ingest and model messy, unstructured data into insights and actionable intelligence. At the heart of this is a 50m+ entity knowledge-graph with 200m+ relationships represented - and we need your help to build a system that can scale this up by an order of a magnitude. Today, we mostly use Python, Postgres, Airflow and Pyspark.

If you have prior startup experience, can bring strong Python (PySpark is a big plus) experience and have previously worked with TB-scale data sets - we’d love to talk to you.
