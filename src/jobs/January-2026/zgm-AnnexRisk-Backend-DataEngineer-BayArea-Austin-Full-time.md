Annex Risk - Backend + Data Engineer - Bay Area, Austin - Full-time

The cost of homeowners insurance, especially in natural catastrophe prone areas, has skyrocketed in recent years. Annex is solving this problem with better digital infrastructure for executing the transaction. Our platform enables insurance agents to quote and bind policies within 90 seconds vs. the current multi-day phone&#x2F;email&#x2F;fax-based transaction that is the status quo.

We grew 4x in 2025 and anticipate similar growth in 2026. We&#x27;ve done the above after deploying &lt;$1.5m in funding. We have significant and growing momentum on both the insurance distribution and insurance capital sides of our business; our challenge now is scaling our engineering team to support that progress.

We&#x27;re in that exciting early stage, where someone can contribute foundational new pieces to core parts of our platform.
