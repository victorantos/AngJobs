Uptiv Health - Remote US with occasional travel- Lead&#x2F;Senior Engineer - Full-time - competitive comp + equity, flexible PTO, health benefits, 401K

We are a specialty infusion provider treating chronic conditions (MS, RA, IBD, Alzheimer&#x27;s) across Michigan and expanding into more states. We differentiate through human centered design and whole-person care. Our operations are fragmented across multiple disconnected systems.

We&#x27;re building the Uptiv Platform: a unified system that consolidates everything into one intelligent engine. You&#x27;ll architect the solution - data foundation, workflow orchestration, integrations. Own this end-to-end, work directly with leadership, and shape how we serve patients.

Stack: Open for discussion. You&#x27;ll drive the vision. Must be built with AI-first mindset in engineering tooling and product design.

We&#x27;ve got funding, customers who need this desperately, and a team that knows the problem deeply. You&#x27;ll influence product direction from day one. Experience and understanding of the healthcare space is a strong preference.
