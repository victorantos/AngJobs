Pango - Founding Full-stack Software Engineer - On-site (hybrid) in Stockholm, Sweden (Visa Sponsorship possible) - Full time

Pango is building the world&#x27;s first Agentic Operating System for e-commerce logistics. Our vision is to create the AI e-commerce employee of the future. We are forming our core team in Stockholm and are looking for exceptional engineers. We are based at the SSE Business Lab, where companies such as Klarna, Voi, Budbee or Legora originated. We have achieved a product-market fit and are growing rapidly.

You are a good fit if:

* You are comfortable maintaining, expanding and operating an entire B2B SaaS platform with a high sense of ownership.

* You are happy to take on work that in a large company is divided into a dozen roles, and execute it all at a good enough level.

* You are unafraid of any technology. If we need a desktop app and you haven&#x27;t done one before, you will study the documentation of Electron.js and build one. If a model for predicting delivery times is needed, you will do a literature review to find the right architecture and train one.

* You have strong proficiency in any backend language or platform, with a strong willingness to dive deep into PHP&#x2F;Laravel OR strong proficiency in JS&#x2F;React.

* E-commerce (Shopify, Magento, other platforms, shipping carrier integrations) experience is a plus.

You will take a key role in shaping the product and company, with ability to make an impact and advance career limited only by your aptitude and interest.
