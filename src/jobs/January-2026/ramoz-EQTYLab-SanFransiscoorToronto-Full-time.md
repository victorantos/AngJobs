EQTY Lab - Software Engineers &amp; DevRel - San Fransisco or Toronto - Full-time

EQTY Lab is focused on emerging governance and security paradigms for AI infrastructure. Our primary focus is verifiable computing using cryptographic capabilities to identify and govern agent behavior.

We&#x27;re also focused on helping the industry advance with frontier tooling. From requesting the hooks feature in Claude Code, to building our own open-source integrated capabilities such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eqtylab&#x2F;cupcake" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eqtylab&#x2F;cupcake</a> - we will continue to explore and share the things we develop for coding agents or any frontier tooling enterprise is quickly adopting.

We&#x27;re seeking software engineers across the full stack. To include,

<pre><code>    - engineers interested in governance tooling
    - sdk writing in TypeScript or Rust
    - or engineers with cryptographic security domain experience
    - or deeper hardware level focus (platforming on Kubernetes - confidential computing, custom firmware as it relates to GPUs).
</code></pre>
For all of this, we&#x27;re seeking experienced devrel to help us communicate and build tooling the right way.
