Trunk is an a16z funded (25M) Series A dev tools startup, redefining software development at scale. At Trunk, our mission is to help teams create high-quality software quickly. We&#x27;ve helped engineerings teams at: Google X, Zillow, and Brex to understand why their builds fail, which tests are flaky, and how to ship code faster without sacrificing reliability.  AI has made writing code 10x faster, but shipping is still painfully slow. The bottleneck has shifted downstream - to merge conflicts, flaky tests, inconsistent code quality, and dozens of other frictions that drain productivity and morale. Engineering teams that can stay focused on designing, implementing, and delivering software will build magical, high-quality projects - and they&#x27;ll be happier doing it. We&#x27;re building a CI Reliability Platform that empowers teams to land code faster and develop happier!

Our products:

<pre><code>  * Merge Queue: Ensure your PRs keep the builds you care about green at any scale.

  *Flaky Tests: Detect and eliminate Flaky Tests.
