I have adapted our &quot;Stealth&quot; pitch to fit their strict format while keeping the &quot;Nerd Bait&quot; hook.
Stealth PropTech Startup - Boston, MA (or Remote) - Founding Full-Stack Engineer - CONTRACT TO HIRE - Competitive Market Rate + Equity
We are looking for a &quot;Mad Scientist&quot; engineer to build a living, gamified dashboard that disrupts a massive legacy industry (Consumer Logistics&#x2F;Real Estate).
The Stack: React, Next.js, Supabase, Node.js. (Bonus: Framer Motion&#x2F;GSAP).
The Project:
This isn&#x27;t a CRUD app. It is a &quot;Command Center&quot; that feels like a video game. It features a dynamic &quot;AI Companion&quot; (Nook) that actively coaches users through complex financial and logistical phases. We need someone who can take a &quot;Frankenstein&quot; MVP concept and turn it into a high-performance, secure, living organism.
About You:
* You treat your IDE like a video game.
* You obsess over micro-interactions and &quot;game feel.&quot;
* You want to be Employee #1 on a product that solves a universal anxiety point for 40k+ users in Boston alone.
The Deal:
* Mode: Contract-to-hire. We start with the MVP build (paid project). If you survive the mission, you become the Founding Engineer.
* Culture: No Jira. No PMs. Just code and shipping.
