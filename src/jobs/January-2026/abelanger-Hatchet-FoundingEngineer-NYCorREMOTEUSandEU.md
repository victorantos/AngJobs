Hey HN! I&#x27;m Alexander, one of the founders of Hatchet. Hatchet is an open-source platform for running background jobs at scale.

We&#x27;re hiring engineers who are excited to build the next class of engineering primitives, starting with queues, background tasks and durable execution. We started in early 2024 after launching our distributed task queue (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643136</a>).

Hatchet is currently used by thousands of engineers for all kinds of workloads: log ingestion pipelines, code review agents, video encoding, GPU scheduling, etc. Our target customer is fast-growing startups who have a strong need for background jobs system. These days, that tends to be AI companies, though we&#x27;re general-purpose and not exclusively targeted for AI workloads.
