Valis Insights (VALIS) - Full-time - Software Engineer - remote-first hybrid Massachusetts (US)
Hi, I&#x27;m Caleb (co-founder&#x2F;CTO) from Valis Insights. We&#x27;re a small climate-tech B2B SaaS&#x2F;HaaS startup, based out of MA. We build material sampling, sorting analytics, and material monitoring web-based and hardware&#x2F;computer-vision enabled solutions for metals recycling companies.

We&#x27;re looking for a passionate SWE with some linux&#x2F;networking&#x2F;firmware experience to drive forward some greenfield product development and help scale &amp; deliver existing hardware-enabled offerings. We&#x27;ve got some scale-integrated cameras deployed in the field which enables a web-app for analytics for material sampling. We&#x27;ve got a few units deployed at metal recycling facilities, and we&#x27;re ramping up sales. We&#x27;re also building a camera-over-conveyor-belt solution for process monitoring (greenfield dev&#x2F;R&amp;D).

Desired Competencies: linux, networking, basic electronics, firmware, cloud infra (AWS), web products, databases

Nice-to-Have Experience: edge-to-cloud CV system deployment&#x2F;design, .NET ecosystem (C#, EF), networking (Wireguard, ssh), firmware dev&#x2F;mgmt, observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus), IaC (Pulumi), stats&#x2F;math&#x2F;ML&#x2F;signal-processing fundamentals, basic soldering, web products (TypeScript, React)

Role is remote-first hybrid. For some hardware&#x2F;firmware&#x2F;R&amp;D, you&#x27;ll need to be in-person in Worcester MA, but majority of role is remote. Infrequent travel to recycling facilities (continental US) for deployment&#x2F;maintenance will be required.
