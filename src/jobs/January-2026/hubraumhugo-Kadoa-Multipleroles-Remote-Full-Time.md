Kadoa - Multiple roles - Remote - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com</a>

We’re on a mission to give humans and LLMs reliable and fast access to web data.

Web scraping used to be the same for decades (brittle scripts that break constantly). We&#x27;re automating that end-to-end with LLMs that build and maintain data pipelines. We&#x27;re also heavily focused on making ethical scraping the default (robots.txt checks, rate limiting, etc.).

All 3 founders have spent years in the trenches writing web scraping and ETL software and still do it almost every single day. We’re making sure every team member can do the best work of their career at Kadoa.

We are looking for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship, data, and AI.

We are growing fast, have a no-bullshit culture, and try to minimize the distance between the code you write and the customers who use it.

We have openings for:

- Senior Frontend Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;frontend-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;frontend-engineer</a>

- Senior Software Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-engineer</a>

If that sounds like you, please email me at (adrian at kadoa dot com) and mention HN in the subject line. AI slop applications will be filtered out immediately ;)
