Noise - Senior Software Engineers (Frontend, Mobile) - NYC - ONSITE - Full-time - $160k-$210k + equity

Noise is building a way to measure and trade attention — something the internet produces endlessly but no one has been able to objectively track. We create a transparent, real-time market for attention itself, revealing what the world actually cares about as it changes.

Team of 10 in SoHo. We look for people with great taste who ship code, design, or convey user needs into delightful products.

Hiring:

Senior Frontend Engineer — Own and ship features across the stack with a frontend focus. Work closely with design to build fast, reusable components. React, TypeScript, Tailwind.

Senior Mobile Engineer — Architect and build our React Native app from zero to launch. Own performance, motion, and polish. Every frame and gesture should feel native.

For both: Not a vibecoder. Uses Cursor or similar to empower, not replace. Strong attention to detail, self-QA, taste for motion and interaction.
