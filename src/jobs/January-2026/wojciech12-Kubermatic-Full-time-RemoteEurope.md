Kubermatic - Full-time - Product Eng &amp; Open Source Dev &amp; CloudNative Consultant - Remote Europe

I am looking for Product Engineers and Open Source Developers to join the KDP and kcp teams.

- Open Source Software Engineer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubermatic.bamboohr.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;24" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubermatic.bamboohr.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;24</a>): Work directly on the upstream kcp project. Your contributions will have a direct impact on the open-source community and will help build a framework for managing multi-tenant services at scale. Kubermatic is the project&#x27;s maintainer.

- Product Software Engineer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubermatic.bamboohr.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;25" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubermatic.bamboohr.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;25</a>): Build a platform that makes other engineers more productive. Drive features from discovery to delivery and shape architectural and product decisions. KDP is currently available as a standalone, on-premises solution. As we prepare to launch a new SaaS offering, you&#x27;ll help evolve our tech stack to meet these emerging requirements.

KCP and KDP tackle the same problem: managing complexity across heterogeneous IT landscapes at scale. kcp is the open-source foundation—a control plane technology that works with any tech stack. We maintain it upstream and contribute to the community. KDP builds on that foundation, delivering a pragmatic platform for enterprise.

We&#x27;re also hiring for a role that bridges our technology with real-world enterprise challenges:

- CloudNative Consultant (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubermatic.bamboohr.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;28" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubermatic.bamboohr.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;28</a>): Partner with some of the largest companies in Europe and the US to solve their toughest infrastructure and engineering challenges. You&#x27;ll guide enterprises through deploying KKP, running virtualization with KubeVirt, and adopting autonomous operations with KDP&#x2F;kcp —turning complex tech transformations into success stories.

Feel free to PM (wojciech.barczynski@kubermatic.com or LinkedIn) me if you would like to learn more.
