I&#x27;m Alex McHale, Lead Developer at GreenArrow Email. We&#x27;re looking to add an additional developer to our team. The right candidate will have solid Go skills and can &quot;hit the ground running&quot; (so sorry for the cliché). Bonus if you&#x27;re a polyglot who might have skills in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

We&#x27;ve put a lot of thought into our job post. Please give it a read. If you think you&#x27;re a fit, there&#x27;s a link at the bottom of the post with a form to fill out.
