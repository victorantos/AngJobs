Commercial Real Estate (CRE) is the world’s largest asset class. The annual transaction volume is 10% of US GDP, yet the industry remains slow and archaic because data is locked in PDFs and Excel files. We are transforming CRE into an AI-native asset class by helping investors understand their own assets better.

*We are hiring in NYC:*

Senior&#x2F;Staff AI&#x2F;IE engineer (NYC)

- Architect RAG&#x2F;prompt systems to parse heterogeneous structured data.
- Develop frameworks connecting LLMs to quantifiable investment decisions.
- Collaborate with finance experts to translate domain knowledge into code.

Senior&#x2F;Staff Full-stack engineer (NYC)

- Own the infrastructure and UI that power high-value investment decisions.
- Design scalable data pipelines and cloud architecture.
- Tackle complex business logic with domain-driven design.

**Who are you:**

- You build things for fun, obsess over craft, and have a lot of product ideas.
- You have proven experience shipping production software to solve *ambiguous business problems*.
- You have experience with end-to-end NLP&#x2F;IE and complex data extraction.
