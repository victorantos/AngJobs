Prodia - Fastest Inference API - London &#x2F; REMOTE (US or Europe) - Software Engineer

Engineers at Prodia build the systems that make image + video generation fast, reliable, and easy for developers to use.

This is a highly practical role: shipping models, features, and improvements that show up directly in latency, quality, and uptime.

Sample projects include…
* Optimising, testing, and integrating frontier image&#x2F;video models (research -&gt; production)
* Building the best APIs for developers: clean ergonomics, great docs, predictable behaviour
* Designing evals + observability: catching regressions, ranking outputs, and understanding quality changes
* Improving our distributed job scheduling (throughput, latency, fairness, cost)
* Reading the latest papers to gather methods for future improvements
* Using the newest AI&#x2F;agentic tooling to speed up debugging, experimentation, and iteration

You might be a fit if…
* You’re an excellent programmer and love shipping quickly
* You&#x27;re a first principles thinker who is unfazed by hard problems
* You&#x27;re looking to learn more about machine learning at a rapid pace
* No specific degree or background required — show us what you’ve built and how you think

Please email me: monty at prodia dot com. If you&#x27;re in London, I&#x27;d love to buy you coffee and learn more about you.
