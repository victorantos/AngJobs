Gambit Robotics - Founding Principal &#x2F; Staff Full-Stack Engineer - NYC - Onsite - Full-time

Hi! I’m Nicole (ex-Google AI), cofounder of Gambit Robotics with Eliot Horowitz (cofounder&#x2F;CTO MongoDB).

We’re hiring for two founding engineering roles to work directly with us in our NYC office (in-person only):

1) Founding Principal &#x2F; Staff Full-Stack Engineer
   - 8+ years experience shipping production systems
   - Strong backend and systems foundation
   - Experience owning architecture end-to-end (zero → production)

2) Founding Full-Stack Engineer
   - 4–6 years experience building and shipping production products
   - Strong product sense and ownership
   - Comfortable working across backend, client, and infrastructure

Gambit is an AI-powered kitchen assistant that mounts magnetically under most range hoods or microwaves. It uses computer vision, thermal imaging, and on-device AI to understand what’s happening in the pan in real time, and handles the hardest parts of cooking — heat, timing, and doneness — so people get better results with less stress.

We’re moving quickly from prototype to product and launching via Kickstarter later this month. It’s a seed-stage startup with high autonomy, real impact, and a very intense (and fun) next phase.

If you or someone you know might be a fit, email me:
