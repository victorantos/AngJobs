Lightcraft Technology - Senior iOS Real Time Engineer - Remote (US) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightcraft.pro&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lightcraft.pro&#x2F;</a>

Hi! I’m the co-founder of Lightcraft Technology. We’re creating a collaborative virtual production platform for the future of visual storytelling. Our team includes deep expertise in robotic systems, real time video processing, and Web frameworks – and a couple of Emmys and Oscars between us!

Our award-winning Jetset iOS app is the core of our real-time connection to cine cameras and stage production. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;app&#x2F;lightcraft-jetset&#x2F;id1634621836">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;app&#x2F;lightcraft-jetset&#x2F;id1634621836</a>

We’re looking for a senior iOS&#x2F;real time developer to help craft the next generation of previsualization and on-set filmmaking experiences, where the stage meets the network. You’ll work closely with our small, fast-moving team on leading-edge technologies in augmented reality, rendering, and networking.

This is a product where milliseconds and mathematics matter, and mutexes are a love language. Spin up your xCode profiler, put the pedal to the Metal, and send responses to eliot (at) lightcrafttech.com.
