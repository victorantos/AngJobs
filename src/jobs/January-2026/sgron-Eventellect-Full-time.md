Eventellect - Hybrid &#x2F; Onsite &#x2F; Remote (US – NY, TX, MA only) - Full-time

Eventellect builds algorithmic systems for live event ticketing. We’re on a mission to fix ticketing for fans and teams -- eliminating inefficiencies, replacing opaque pricing, and getting the right tickets directly to the right fans at the right time. We work directly with both sports teams and other major live events, directly shaping revenue, attendance, and fan experience at scale.

We’re hiring for:

Full-Stack Engineers (Senior+)
Own and build complete systems. Work on real-time pricing, inventory management, and internal&#x2F;external tooling. Looking for strong fundamentals, ownership, and good judgment.

Data Platform Engineers (Staff &#x2F; Principal)
Own the data stack and internal data products. Design core data models, pipelines, and standards that support analytics, modeling, and operations. High-impact role with real ownership.

What we’re looking for:
Strong builders who thrive in messy real-world problem spaces, take ownership, and ship.
