BetterBugs - Remote - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterbugs.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterbugs.io</a>

We’re building debugging intelligence for modern software teams.
BetterBugs captures rich technical context at the moment a bug occurs and turns it into actionable insights for developers — not screenshots, not back-and-forth.

Our next leap: AI that understands bugs, not just describes them.

Senior AI &#x2F; LLM Engineer (Python) : Build production LLM systems that understand real-world bug context (logs, stack traces, network, user actions).
Design agent workflows for root-cause analysis, bug triaging, and debugging assistance.
Implement RAG pipelines grounded in codebases, historical bugs, and execution data.
Own prompting, evaluation, reliability, and observability of AI outputs.
Build and operate Python services (FastAPI) powering AI features in production.
Strong Python, hands-on LLM&#x2F;agent frameworks, Docker; bonus for dev tooling or observability experience.
