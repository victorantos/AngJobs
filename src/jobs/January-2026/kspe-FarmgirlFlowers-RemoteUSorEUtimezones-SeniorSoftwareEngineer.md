 - Remote (US or EU timezones) - Senior Software Engineer

I’m the Director of Engineering at Farmgirl Flowers, an online flower shop with a loyal customer base. We&#x27;re looking for a product-minded engineer who can own projects end-to-end and keep things simple, safe, and maintainable.

We&#x27;re a small team of three, so communication is fast and your impact will be immediately visible. We value pragmatism over &quot;perfect&quot; - shipping useful solutions matters more than polishing forever.

Stack: Rails 8, MySQL, Heroku, AWS, a little React -&gt; moving toward Hotwire.
