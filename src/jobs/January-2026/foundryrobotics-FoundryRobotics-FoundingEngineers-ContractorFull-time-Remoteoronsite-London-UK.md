Foundry Robotics - Founding Engineers - Contract or Full-time - Remote or onsite - London, UK

I&#x27;m Gio, CTO of Foundry Robotics. We&#x27;re an early stage London-based startup building robotic solutions for manufacturing applications.

We have 3 open positions:

1) Tinkerer&#x2F;mechanical engineer -- Help us build our robots in our lab with a mixture of design and hands-on prototyping. Experience with metal fabrication (CAD, CNC milling, turning, 3d printing, sheet metal).

2) Software&#x2F;robotics engineer C++&#x2F;Python -- Help us build our software with a lot of autonomy. Navigate documentation for the different components and technology options and make key decisions. Path to become a team lead. Experience in robotics is not required if you have experience in adjacent fields such as 3d graphics (game engines for example).

3) Robotics research engineer -- Be our first research hire. Experience with computer vision, NVidia Isaac or similar simulation environments. Background in reinforcement learning.
