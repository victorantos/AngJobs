Rainbow is a tech-enabled small-business insurer. We built software that underwrites small businesses (starting with restaurants) and evaluates them against various risks to provide them with insurance policies. We&#x27;ve been live for only 2.5 years but already one of the top insurers of restaurants in the US. We are looking for an experienced software engineer to join our team and help us grow and innovate. We&#x27;ve raised around $20m to date with a series A around end of 2024. We&#x27;ve grown massively over the past year. Most of our problems we&#x27;re currently working on are about building tech as we expand out to other categories of insurance and insuring other types of businesses.

Job Requirements:

- 5+ years of professional experience as a software engineer

- Experience in fintech is an optional but major plus

- Familiarity with our tech stack (Golang, React through a Next.js app, GraphQL, PostgreSQL) is beneficial but not required

Why You’d Enjoy Working with Us:

- You&#x27;re joining a small fast paced team: 12 engineers, 40 people total

- Direct impact on solving real-world problems for small businesses

- Hybrid work model with 2 days on-site in SF

- Competitive salary and benefits
