Pelairo Inc. - Senior Full Stack Developer - REMOTE (US Only) - Full-time - $100-150k

At Pelairo we&#x27;re building the most intuitive and flexible Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) on the market. &quot;Manage the lab, not the LIMS!&quot;

After a successful hire from our post in November, we&#x27;re back! We&#x27;re looking for a hands-on Senior Full Stack Developer to help design and deliver core product experiences across our stack (TypeScript + NestJS on the backend and Next.js on the frontend.) You&#x27;ll work on customer-facing workflows, turning ambiguity into shippable slices, and helping us level up reliability, security, and speed as we scale.

What you&#x27;ll do:

<pre><code>    - Build features: implement and ship production ready functionality across frontend and backend (TypeScript, Next.js, NestJS).

    - Backend: contribute heavily to APIs, data models, and integrations that power questionnaire-driven workflows and FHIR pipelines.

    - Frontend: build intuitive, configurable UI modules for complex healthcare workflows, collaborate closely with Product and domain experts.

    - Quality &amp; reliability: contribute to testing strategy (unit&#x2F;integration&#x2F;contract&#x2F;E2E), safe migrations, and rollouts (feature flags).

    - Observability &amp; performance: instrument tracing&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;logging, improve dashboards&#x2F;alerts, and participate in incident reviews and follow-ups.
    - Engineering excellence: raise the bar through strong code reviews, pragmatic standards, and improvements to the developer experience.

    - FHIR correctness: help ensure backend transformations produce valid FHIR resources in Medplum and support scalable data flows.
</code></pre>
What makes you a great fit:

<pre><code>    - 7+ years building production web applications (frontend + backend) in a fast-moving environment.

    - Strong TypeScript + Node.js experience and solid production exposure to NestJS (or comparable backend frameworks with willingness to ramp quickly).

    - Strong experience with modern React-based frontend development (React &#x2F; Next.js) and comfort owning UI implementation details.

    - Experience shipping ambiguous projects end-to-end with good judgment, pragmatism, and clear communication.

    - Familiar with building secure systems and thoughtful about reliability, testing, and performance.
</code></pre>
Bonuses:

<pre><code>    - Experience with FHIR &#x2F; Medplum, healthcare data workflows, or LIMS&#x2F;clinical systems.

    - Familiarity with HIPAA and&#x2F;or SOC 2 practices.

    - AWS experience (e.g., Cognito, Fargate) and comfort working in cloud-native environments.
</code></pre>
Stack: TypeScript (Next.js + NestJS), Medplum, AWS (Cognito, Fargate)
Visa&#x2F;relocation: No
