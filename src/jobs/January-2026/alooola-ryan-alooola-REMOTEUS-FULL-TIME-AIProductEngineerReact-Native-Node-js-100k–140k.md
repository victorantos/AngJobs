alooola - REMOTE (US) - FULL-TIME - AI Product Engineer (React-Native + Node.js) - $100k–$140k

alooola is a wealth management mobile app for medical professionals (investing + retirement + spending), backed by a 30-year advisory firm with ~$1B AUM. Our app is in production and we’re expanding features now that a major custody&#x2F;infrastructure upgrade is complete.

We’re hiring our second engineer to own features end-to-end across React Native&#x2F;TypeScript (iOS&#x2F;Android) and Node.js&#x2F;Express&#x2F;Postgres. AI tools (Claude&#x2F;GPT) are part of the daily workflow, but we care most about strong fundamentals, validation, and UX polish.

Benefits: medical fully covered; 401k match after 1 year; flexible schedule; unlimited PTO
