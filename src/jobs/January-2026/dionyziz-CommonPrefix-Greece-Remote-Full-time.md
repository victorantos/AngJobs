Common Prefix - Software Engineers &#x2F; DevOps - Greece - Remote - Full-time

Common Prefix is a blockchain research &amp; development company. Blockchain technologies enable large-scale economic coordination through shared, programmable ledgers. Our mission is to solve the foundational scientific and engineering challenges standing in the way of mainstream adoption, particularly around interoperability, scalability, and usability. We combine formal scientific research with production-grade engineering. Our team publishes in top-tier peer-reviewed venues and builds open-source infrastructure used across major blockchain ecosystems. We have contributed to advanced systems including Axelar, XRPL, Sui, and Flashbots, and are trusted partners to protocols building critical infrastructure.

What we&#x27;re looking for:

Software engineers who can solve problems, are smart, get things done, and enjoy working on the bleeding edge, learning about cryptography, and working from first-principles.

Tech stack: Doesn&#x27;t matter, we&#x27;ll teach you. But we work mostly with Rust, Go, and TypeScript.
