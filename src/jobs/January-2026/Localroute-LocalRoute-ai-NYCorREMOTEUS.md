LocalRoute.ai - Founding Engineer (Infra &#x2F; Full-Stack) - NYC or REMOTE (US)

We’re an early-stage startup building a privacy-first AI routing layer for teams running multiple models across on-prem and hybrid environments.

The problem: AI workloads default to overpowered models and leak sensitive data because there’s no intelligent routing layer.

We’re looking for a founding engineer who enjoys systems-level problems, ambiguity, and owning architecture end-to-end. You’ll help design routing logic, policy enforcement, and developer-facing interfaces from the ground up.

Tech we’re working with &#x2F; around: backend services, model orchestration, infra, performance, privacy boundaries (stack flexible at this stage).

Location: NYC preferred, open to strong remote (US)
Stage: very early, YC-bound
Comp: equity (range depends on stage and fit)
