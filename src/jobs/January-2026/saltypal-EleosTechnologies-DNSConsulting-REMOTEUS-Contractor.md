Eleos Technologies - DNS Consulting - REMOTE (US) - Contractor

We build mobile apps and supporting systems for long-haul truck drivers.

We have a critical DNS registrar&#x2F;hosting migration to do this year and while I did the last one (on a less-critical domain), I&#x27;d really like support from someone who has done &gt;5 of these to help our team get it right. Good news: no DNSSEC. =)

Please reach out to me at phil@eleostech.com and mention this post if this is you and you have a reference or two. It should be really easy project for the right person, but we&#x27;ll compensate commensurate with the business risk.
