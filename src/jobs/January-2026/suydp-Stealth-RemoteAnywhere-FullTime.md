Stealth - Software&#x2F;AI Engineer - Remote Anywhere - Full Time

Hello, I am bootstrapping an AI companion startup. I believe that within 10 years, more people will date AI than humans. I think this is neither good nor bad, just interesting, and I want to build something in this space.

I am looking to hire someone with strong technical and problem solving skills. You will be seeing a lot of problems for the first time and need to just figure out how to hack a solution. Sometimes that involves writing code but not always. It is ok if you don&#x27;t have prior AI experience.

Interesting problems we will work on:

- extreme latency issues while providing a fully multimodal experience (audio, video, text)

- building models that predict when to interrupt in a conversation

- building models and control systems for emotion

- generating avatar response in real time

- custom 3d models from input image

- real time or very fast video generation with custom characters

- llm memory

As I am bootstrapping this, I can only offer up to $4,000&#x2F;mo ($50,000&#x2F;yr) at the moment. If you are interested, please email James at gcyiuqy1 [at] gmail.com
