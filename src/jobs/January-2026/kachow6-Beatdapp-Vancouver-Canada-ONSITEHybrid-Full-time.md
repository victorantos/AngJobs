Beatdapp - Vancouver, Canada - ONSITE (Hybrid) - Full-time

Beatdapp is a venture-backed ML&#x2F;music startup based in Vancouver, Canada. We&#x27;re a relatively small company of ~50 people that works with media companies to solve data intensive (TB&#x2F;PB scale) problems using ML and classic data systems engineering.

We&#x27;re looking for a:

- Cloud Infrastructure&#x2F;Data&#x2F;MLOps Engineer

to work on our ML recommendation systems, but you&#x27;ll probably get the opportunity to work on other data systems and the rest of our ML platform as well.

The team pretty great, lots of collaboration and no egos. If you like video games or tabletop games you&#x27;ll fit right in. Your stack would probably include a lot of GCP (BigQuery, GCS, ...), K8s, Airflow, datastores (Redis, BigTable, etc.) and Python.
