BuilderBase is hiring a Growth &amp; Partnerships Lead

BuilderBase is an AI-native platform for hackathons, innovation sprints, and accelerator-style builder programs.

Our team includes ex-VC partners, operators who’ve raised $70M+, and engineers from Sequoia- and YC-backed startups.

We already have US customers, are launching publicly in January, and have our calendar fully booked with customer conversations worldwide.

This is our first US hire and a key founding-team role.

You’ll own growth and partnerships end-to-end, run live customer and partner conversations, and turn GTM activity into scalable, automated systems using AI.

We’re looking for exceptional candidates and are flexible on compensation, equity, and role scope.
