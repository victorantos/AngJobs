Marker is a technology venture from 3 leading communications agencies. We’re an incubator building and launching force-multiplying software products for communications teams.

Our product team is small and autonomous, but with the resources, expertise, and customer access of the global agencies we work with. We’re hiring an early engineer to join us on this journey; you’ll have a large impact on what we build, how we build it, and where we’re going next.
