Dirac - Junior&#x2F;Senior Software Engineer (£60k-£95k) + 0.3-0.6% equity - London, Acton - In-person

Backed by patio11 &amp; backedvc, we&#x27;re an exporting startup, offering a chance to write code (django&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;python), learn to drive a forklift (Hyster J2.0UTT) and wire up label printers (brother-ql 1100c + a new zebra one which I bricked using Chat GPT sending commands directly through).

Experience as a forklift driver not essential. You should feel excited by writing and designing code which will analyze cash flows, optimise pricing, improve shipment monitoring.

The role would ideally start in November, but we can be flexible (forecasting labour demand on an exponential curve is non-trivial)

Email me ethan@dirac.software if interested.
