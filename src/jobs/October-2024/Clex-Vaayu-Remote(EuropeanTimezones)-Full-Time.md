Vaayu - Remote (European Timezones) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaayu.tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaayu.tech&#x2F;</a>

At Vaayu, we&#x27;re on a mission to fight climate change by helping e-commerce retailers measure and reduce their carbon emissions. E-commerce has a significant climate impact, and calculating carbon manually can be time-consuming and costly. Our goal is to make carbon analytics accessible to every online retailer, empowering them to take control of their environmental footprint.

Our automated software is already trusted by sustainability leaders such as Klarna, Wunderman Thompson, Vinted, Ace &amp; Tate, Adevinta or New Balance, linking up with shop platforms to deliver the tools necessary for retailers to take charge of their environmental footprint.

We are a distributed company based in Berlin, with an international and diverse team throughout Europe.

We are looking for a mid-level Golang engineer to join our team. Experience working with large existing codebases is a plus.

If you’re an innovator and want to work in a purpose-driven startup, we’d love to hear from you! To apply, email me at clem [at] vaayu [dot] tech, please mention HN in the subject.
