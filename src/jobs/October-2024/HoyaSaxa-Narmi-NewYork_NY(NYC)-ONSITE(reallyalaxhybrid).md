Narmi - New York, NY (NYC) - ONSITE (really a lax hybrid) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.narmi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.narmi.com</a>

Narmi is helping reinvent banking in the United States. We create a more accessible and useful financial ecosystem by powering the online banking, mobile banking, account opening and open banking APIs for the 10,000 credit unions and community banks in the United States.

You&#x27;ll be working on production software that has a real impact on the average American&#x27;s life everyday. Our software helps them save money on their bills, understand their financial story, protect their families and move money.

Narmi was founded by two Georgetown University alums who previously worked as CEO and CTO of an $18 million credit union and also at some of the largest banks in the world.

We are a Series B startup with a great group of investors including a top 5 VC (NEA), we are continuing to grow quickly, and have a sustainable business model.

Even if you don&#x27;t think you are an exact fit for one of our current openings, we&#x27;d still love to talk. We are always looking for well-rounded engineers to join our team in NYC.
