Taiyaki Studios - React Native - Tokyo - On-site Full Time - Will Sponsor Visa

We’re creating animated dramas from Webtoons&#x2F;Manga and releasing them on our own app&#x2F;webapp.

This role will primarily focus on building the mobile and web platforms for delivering our shows, but as a small team of 4 we all wear many hats and are exploring creating interactive content as well.

We license finished shows and webtoons, and build tools to produce original content in-house.

Ideal candidate: We value fast learners who are language agnostic.

Bonus: Python, ComfyUI experience.

Japanese proficiency not required, though nice to have. We’ll pay for weekly lessons if you want them.

If you need visa sponsorship, you’ll need a bachelor’s or 10 years experience. Not our requirement, gov’t requirement. We’ll help with all relocation logistics.

We pay 20M JPY&#x2F;yr (~$140k&#x2F;yr) + equity, 3-4X median salary in Tokyo, you’ll live in luxury or save a good chunk of your salary.
