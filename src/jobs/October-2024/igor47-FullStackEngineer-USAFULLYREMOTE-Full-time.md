Rock Rabbit (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockrabbit.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockrabbit.ai</a>) - Full Stack Engineer - USA FULLY REMOTE - Full-time

Buildings account for ~40% of all emissions. There is a ton of federal, state, and local programs to help decarbonize buildings -- but this money is difficult to access, trapped behind complicated program requirements, uncertain eligibility, lack of clarity, and long payout cycles. We make access to these incentives easy by abstracting away the policy complexity and letting our users focus on their projects. Our platform serves contractors, homeowners, incentive providers, and equipment manufacturers.

We&#x27;re hiring Full Stack Engineers for full time roles. We&#x27;re well-funded, have a lot of customer traction, and are rapidly expanding the team. Our product vision is very clear -- the bottleneck is skillful, user-focused execution.

Tech stack: Python (FastAPI, pyright), Google cloud (GKE), React (Typescript, react-query, auto-gen API client)

We value curiosity, ownership and collaboration. Interest in energy, climate, and sustainability is a plus.
