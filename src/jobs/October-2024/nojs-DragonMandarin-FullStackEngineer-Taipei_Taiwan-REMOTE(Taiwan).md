Dragon Mandarin - Full Stack Engineer - Taipei, Taiwan - REMOTE (Taiwan) - &gt;= 80k+ NTD

We&#x27;re building an app that rewrites arbitrary Chinese text into simpler language, helping users learn Chinese by reading interesting content.

You will be our first hire working directly with me, the founder. Youâ€™d be working very independently, with approximately weekly in-person meetings in Taipei.

NTD 80k+&#x2F;month depending on experience. Must be reasonably fluent in Chinese.

Apply if you are interested in the intersection of Chinese language learning and AI. Current stack is Django + React (experience beneficial but not essential if you learn fast).
