Adia Thermal - Mobile App Developer (React Native &#x2F; Python) - HYBRID &#x2F; London - Full-Time

Adia is on a mission to dramatically accelerate the decarbonisation of home heating by making heat pumps much easier to install with wet-loop heating. Adia utilises AI and affordable, easily installed sensors to rapidly deploy digital twins of homes. Our technology measures and simulates room-by-room heat loss, energy usage, and the fluid dynamics of wet heating loops. These simulations allow Adia Thermal to predict and control heating system performance, optimising the efficiency of both the heat pump and radiators, leading to simpler, quicker installations and lower bills for homeowners.

The Mobile App Developer Mobile will lead the development of our Adia Thermal mobile application, creating a platform that provides heat pump installers with the best possible experience and gives homeowners intuitive, simple, and efficient control over their heating systems.
