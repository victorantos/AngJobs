Felt - DevOps Eng — Elixir Eng — Social Media Rep - Oakland, CA or REMOTE (US timezones) - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com</a>

Felt is building a cloud-based geographic information systems (GIS) solution and have hundreds of customers already using it to run their operations, processing terabyte. Our team hails from Uber, Google, Meta, CARTO, Mapbox, The New York Times and a few others. If you have used online maps in the past few years, you have used their work. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I&#x27;m an early Uber engineer.

We are on the lookout for three roles!

First is an infrastructure focused engineer. This role involves shaping cloud infrastructure and APIs to ensure platform scalability and security. Ideal candidates are experts in major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), skilled in designing user-friendly public APIs, and experienced in leading teams to make strategic architectural decisions. They should be proficient in modern approaches like Kubernetes, serverless computing, and IaaC (via CDK) to optimize deployments for performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

Second is an exceptional Elixir engineer. Our application team builds what our end-users experience; a lightning fast and easy-to-use mapping tool that works in the browser. We are primarily using Elixir &#x2F; Phoenix on the server side and have a spatially focused React on the frontend side. As an Elixir engineer, you&#x27;ll be working with folks who are experts in their field [2], release more than 15+ a day [3], and aren&#x27;t afraid to break new ground when necessary [4].

Our team makes geospatial datasets a breeze to work with and we are currently building our next-generation of our data stack on AWS. The team you&#x27;ll be joining is full of expert engineers, and well known people in the Elixir community. You might have used their work already.

Our third role is an social media and community representative. We are creating a new category of tooling in a giant industry and we need your help to tell the story. The ideal candidate will have experience building a community around a grand vision, while being grounded in our customers&#x27; successes and our team&#x27;s ability to ship.

We are well-funded and just raised our $15M Series A. You can read more about it our funding here [5], and our announcement here [6]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[7]
