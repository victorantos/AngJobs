Ai2 - Senior Software Engineer - Seattle, WA - ONSITE &#x2F; HYBRID -

Ai2 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allenai.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allenai.org</a>) is a Seattle based non-profit AI research institute founded in 2014 by the late Paul Allen. We develop foundational AI research and innovation to deliver real-world impact through large-scale open models, data, robotics, conservation, and beyond.

My team (ReOps) maintains the software and servers that allow research teams at Ai2 to execute machine learning workloads on high performance, SOTA GPU clusters.

Most of our time is spent contributing to Beaker (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.allenai.org&#x2F;beaker-ed617d5f4593" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.allenai.org&#x2F;beaker-ed617d5f4593</a>), a GPU-first job orchestration system that was authored at the institute. We also spend a fair amount of time configuring and operating the underlying on-premise GPU servers.

We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our team. You should be proficient in Go and Python and have prior experience operating and configuring linux servers in a professional setting.
