Offstream (YC S24) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useoffstream.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useoffstream.com&#x2F;</a> - Denver, CO - Backend software engineer - $130k - $170k + equity

Offstream’s mission is to enable carbon compliance by building the tools clean tech developers use to stay compliant and maximize revenue for their operations. We work with clean tech developers globally to simplify the complex web of compliance across IRA tax credit requirements, voluntary carbon market standards, and local, state, and federal regulations. The market for low-carbon projects is rapidly growing fueled by $500B+ IRA incentives from the US, purchase commitments made by large corporate buyers, compliance market mechanisms, and the climate crisis. Offstream enables the launch and scale-up of projects that are critical to net zero.

We are looking for a talented back end software engineer to join our growing engineering team. The role will be mostly back end focused but it will sometimes be necessary to work on the front end of the application, especially while the team is small. You will be the second engineer to join the engineering team (currently 1 engineer + co-founder&#x2F;CTO) and have a massive impact on the architecture and shape of the Offstream product.
