EdgeDB - SREs &#x2F; Infrastructure Engineers - Full-time - Fully remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edgedb.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edgedb.com&#x2F;</a>

EdgeDB is an open-source database built on top of Postgres. Itâ€™s designed to give developers a better end-to-end user experience than traditional SQL databases. We provide a more expressive schema modeling &amp; query language (EdgeQL), and &quot;batteries included&quot; features such as built-in schema migrations and a graphical schema browser, data explorer, and access control&#x2F;auth.

We offer a hosted cloud service for EdgeDB, with the goal of doing developer-friendly cloud hosting &quot;the right way&quot; - we want users to use our hosted service because it&#x27;s great, not because they&#x27;re locked-in by restrictive licensing or cloud-only features.

We are looking for experienced SREs &#x2F; infrastructure &#x2F; devops engineers to help scale out our cloud. Unlike many infrastructure roles, this is not supporting a separate product team - for us, our infrastructure is our product. We are looking for people who care about not just building reliable infrastructure but also exposing that infrastructure to end-users as a seamless product.

Our tech stack is Hashicorp tools (Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault); Postgres; Golang with some Python &amp; Rust; and AWS (with eventual expansion to other cloud platforms)

We are a remote-first company, headquartered in San Francisco, with most of the team working in US&#x2F;Canada timezones and a few people in Europe. Unfortunately we are unable to provide any visa&#x2F;immigration sponsorship at this time.
