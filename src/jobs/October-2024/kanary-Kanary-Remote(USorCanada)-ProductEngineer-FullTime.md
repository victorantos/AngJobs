Kanary - Remote (US or Canada) - Product Engineer - Full Time

We’re building the fastest way to fight doxxing, digital stalking, and deepfakes.

As the first Product Engineer, you’ll help launch and scale our mobile app, Kanary Copilot. Copilot automates data removal requests, fixes social media settings, monitors for risks, and sorts through thousands of expert recommendations for what’s relevant. All from the privacy of your device.

Join our team of 6, proudly backed by YC, 2048.vc, and Mozilla, and now funded by our customers.
