Reckon Digital - Data engineer - Remote or Hybrid (London)

RD (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reckondigital.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reckondigital.com</a>) is looking for somebody to work on data pipelines for our client, a humanitarian organisation. Relevant technologies: Python; Pandas; AWS (mostly Lambda &#x2F; S3); SQL (including fairly complex queries); Git; Pytest; Pydantic; Jupyter Notebooks; Django (just used for db migrations, not the web part).
It&#x27;s a bonus if you can make it into our Farringdon office, at least sometimes. Starting ASAP. We currently have work until January, but there could be more in future
