Tandem Health - Software Engineers - On-site in Stockholm, Sweden - Full time

At Tandem Health we&#x27;re building a clinician copilot to allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have hundreds of clinicians using the product every day. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician interaction to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient.

We’ve recently raised a large seed round and are expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! Our tech stack is mostly Python and TypeScript&#x2F;React running on k8s in Azure.
