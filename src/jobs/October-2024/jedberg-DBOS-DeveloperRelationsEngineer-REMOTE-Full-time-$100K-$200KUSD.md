DBOS - Developer Relations Engineer - REMOTE - Full-time - $100K - $200K USD

DBOS is a serverless platform for building reliable&#x2F;durable backends at a fraction of the cost of competitors.  We are looking for someone to help us spread the gospel of serverless and reliability.

You would be responsible for building demo apps in Python and&#x2F;or Typescript and the writing about them and talking about them around the internet (HN, Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter, Dev.to, wherever else you think makes sense) and in person.  You&#x27;d also manage our overall social media strategy, and keep an eye on the pulse of how people feel about us and are talking about us.

The full job description is here, but don&#x27;t worry about the experience requirements, we&#x27;d love to hear from recent grads too!
