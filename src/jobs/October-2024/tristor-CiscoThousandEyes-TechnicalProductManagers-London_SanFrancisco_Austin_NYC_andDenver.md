Cisco ThousandEyes - Technical Product Managers - London, San Francisco, Austin, NYC, and Denver

Cisco ThousandEyes is a digital experience assurance (DXA) SaaS platform which applies machine-learning capabilities on top of synthetic active monitoring conducted from points of visibility around the world to surface actionable insights about the performance and reliability of critical applications and network infrastructure and provide customers a way to go from a telescope view to a microscope view of any issue to understand its blast radius and quickly get to MTTI&#x2F;MTTR.  ThousandEyes was acquired by Cisco at the end of 2020 and remains a fast-growing portion of the overall Cisco portfolio.

We are looking for three Technical Product Managers to join our world-class Product team.  One role is on our platform team with a focus on Open Telemetry and API capabilities.  Two roles are on my team within our agents organization focused on harmonizing our core capabilities across the many different points of visibility we support deploying agents to.  Successful candidates for these roles should be technical, first and foremost, with a preference for people with an engineering and CS background.  We believe it requires strong technical fundamentals to fully understand our product which primarily serves technical practitioners like SRE, NetOps, and IT teams.
