thoughtful.ai - Staff Software Engineers (Applied AI and Platform) - REMOTE (USA only) - Full-time - $190-250k + early equity

We are a Health Tech &#x2F; AI automation start-up growing 3x YoY (we recently raised our Series A round!) and looking to expand our engineering team.

Our core platform consists of a front-end app, back-end API, SDK, and some DevEx tooling. The tech stack consists of AWS, Typescript, NextJS, React, and Python.

We are looking for individuals with experience working in early-stage startups. The ideal candidate should be excited about learning new things, passionate about DevEx&#x2F;DevProd, and comfortable cutting through ambiguity.

If that sounds exciting to you, apply on our website (we review every submission):
