Polars -  Database Engineer (Rust) - Amsterdam - ONSITE - Fulltime - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiring.pola.rs&#x2F;o&#x2F;database-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiring.pola.rs&#x2F;o&#x2F;database-engineer</a>

Polars is the next generation of DataFrames. We donâ€™t take the easy route and build from the ground up, controlling every element allows us to create a superior solution. Our open-source implementation is one of the fastest growing data projects on GitHub and has over 26 thousand stars and 39 million downloads to date.

We believe data processing should be a seamless experience from working locally on your development machine to an enterprise production environment. There should be one framework to learn for data practitioners, removing the need for rewriting code when going to production.
