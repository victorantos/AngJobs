Big Health - Backend Software Engineers - Remote US - Full-time

At Big Health our digital therapeutics — Sleepio for insomnia, Daylight for anxiety, and Spark Direct for depression — provide treatment anytime, anywhere. In pursuit of our mission, we’ve pioneered the first at-scale digital therapeutic business model, in partnership with some of the most prominent global healthcare organizations, including CVS Health and the UK’s NHS.

We use a variety of technologies, but mostly we&#x27;re a react-native frontend that uses django and postgre running on AWS shop.

We also have some Frontend positions open as well that are not on lever. You can reach out to me directly for those at timothy dot hou at bighealth.com with HN in the subject.
