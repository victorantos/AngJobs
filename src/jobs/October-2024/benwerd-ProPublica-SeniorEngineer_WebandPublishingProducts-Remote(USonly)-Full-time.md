ProPublica - Senior Engineer, Web and Publishing Products - Remote (US only) - Full-time

ProPublica is an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.

We&#x27;re looking for a full-stack senior product engineer to lead work on our publishing systems and core website. The right candidate will believe in our mission and thrive in a multifaceted role, contributing both to the long-term product road map and to hands-on development. Our CMS is PHP-based but we extensively use Python and Typescript across our internal systems.

Also, you&#x27;ll be helping to speak against abuses of power and potentially protecting our democracy. Feeling good about that is a prerequisite to taking the position.
