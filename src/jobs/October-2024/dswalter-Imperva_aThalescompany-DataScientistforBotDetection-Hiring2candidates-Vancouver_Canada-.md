Imperva, a Thales company - Data Scientist for Bot Detection - Hiring 2 candidates - Vancouver, Canada - Hybrid

We are looking for talented, experienced Data Scientists who are ever curious about data problems and eager to write code to get those problems solved.

Members of this team creatively find problems as well as solve them. Much of the work is analyzing detection mechanisms and bot behaviors, making advances in realtime bot detection and mitigation, and implementing those advances in production.

The positions are on the team I lead. The data and problem are interesting, data is intrinsically useful in bot detection, and there is no shortage of challenge to working a difficult problem. Python, SQL, and Rust are some languages we&#x27;re currently using for most of our work.
