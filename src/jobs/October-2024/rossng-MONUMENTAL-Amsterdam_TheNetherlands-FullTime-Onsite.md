MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite

We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, and we’re starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.

We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a neat software stack that lets us configure and control robots with ease. We’re deploying our robots on real construction sites and have started making the first revenue from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.

The software team is now nine people (~35 people overall), and continuing to grow. There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building, and we’re starting to scale up robot production to meet it.

Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.

Interested in getting your hands (sometimes literally) dirty solving interesting problems? Have a look at our open roles:

- Software Engineer, Controls

- Software Engineer, Machine Vision

- Other: assembly&#x2F;manufacturing&#x2F;electronics technicians, robot operators, workshop lead
