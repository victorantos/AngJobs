SafetyKit - AI Product Engineer - San Francisco, CA - ONSITE - Full-time - $150K - $220K + Equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safetykit.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safetykit.com</a>

We moderate content for payment processors and large marketplaces, covering any content policy you can think of. From IP infringement (is this cat wearing a Burberry-patterned vest?) to endangered species detection, chargeback risk, and hyper-detailed custom policies for every client. Users include Substack, Upwork, Faire, Character.ai, and Eventbrite.

Your role: Application&#x2F;Product engineering in Postgres&#x2F;Typescript&#x2F;AWS. We need web scrapers, document ingestors, LLM eval tools, and more, and they all need to be fast and reliable.

SafetyKit is started by repeat founders, YC-backed, and growing fast.
