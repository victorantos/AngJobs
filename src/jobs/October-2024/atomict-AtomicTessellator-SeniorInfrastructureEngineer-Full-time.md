Atomic Tessellator - Senior Infrastructure Engineer - Remote (HQ: New Zealand, GMT+12) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomictessellator.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomictessellator.com</a>

We&#x27;re building the worldâ€™s most ambitious ab-initio, in-silico material discovery platform. Our goal is to reimagine the way material scientists conduct experiments, by speeding up the idea-simulation-result loop for small molecule chemistry and materials science.

We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Infrastructure Engineer that brings expertise in Kubernetes and Python. We need help with automating our K8s setup, implementing Helm packaging, and building CI&#x2F;CD pipelines.

While initially there&#x27;s a lot of DevOps in the role, there&#x27;s room to grow into a combination of DevOps and Distributed Systems Programming. This role would suit someone who is excited to transition into some coding.

Even if you don&#x27;t check every box, we encourage you to apply!

Keywords: Kubernetes, Docker, CI&#x2F;CD, Python (Django)
