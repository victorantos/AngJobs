Our team is well-funded &gt;$4m, small and growing - this is a great time to join and contribute to foundational parts of our product! We speak a few languages, love open source, and like to build things that we enjoy using. Our co-founders have experience building data, consumer hardware, and interactive products, including selling a previous venture for &gt;$250m.

Requirements: At least 2+ years of professional experience in a startup or fast-paced team setting. Strong CS and OOP skills with proficiency in more than one of the following (C++, Javascript, python, kotlin, Java). You&#x27;ve worked across the stack, touching the UI, API, data pipeline, cloud and internal build and developer tools.  Bonus: skills in React, React Native, ML infra or cross-platform development.

We pay well, offer generous stock option plans, and benefits (health, dental, vision for US teammates). To apply, send your resume to talent@genos.com
