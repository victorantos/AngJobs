August Health - Senior+ Frontend Software Engineers - Remote, USA - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.augusthealth.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.augusthealth.com</a>
We&#x27;re a growth-stage (Series A in 2022) company that builds technology to enhance the quality of care for vulnerable older adults. Our product is guiding the transition from complex, paper-based practices in the long-term care industry to a digital platform solution that unlocks the power of personalized care, predictive analytics, and value-based contracting.

Technologically, the frontend is TypeScript &amp; React. Our frontend is a major differentiator - our users tend to be less tech-inclined, so ease of use is a business imperative. We also have a service-worker powered offline web app and plan to build another in short order.
