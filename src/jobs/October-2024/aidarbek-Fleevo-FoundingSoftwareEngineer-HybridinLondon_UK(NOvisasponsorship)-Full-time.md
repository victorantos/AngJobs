Fleevo - Founding Software Engineer - Hybrid in London, UK (NO visa sponsorship) - Full-time

Commercial fleets power the most essential operations in the physical world: trucks delivering food to our tables, vans repairing water pipes or installing power lines, construction equipment building our critical infrastructure, and much more. Fleets have a profound impact on our day-to-day lives, but they have historically been underserved by the tech industry.

Fleevo is changing that

We are transforming data into decisions for commercial fleets. Fleevo helps fleets to improve vehicle uptime, drive revenue, cut costs, optimise workflows, and operate more sustainably.

We are looking for our first engineering hire outside of founding team, more details about the company, role, and the application process: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fleevo.notion.site&#x2F;Founding-Software-Engineer-Fleevo-79f0ef833d5246e6b722b8eee58ba1c8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fleevo.notion.site&#x2F;Founding-Software-Engineer-Fleevo...</a>
