Phrasing - CTO - Europe, REMOTE -  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app</a>

Phrasing is a language learning application that actually works.

We have a working product, a few paying users, and a bunch of ideas. Currently we&#x27;re just smoothing out all the bugs before a big launch this fall.

Currently it&#x27;s a two person team - one engineer and one designer. Looking for another engineer to join in a co-founding capacity and help us scale.

Lots of cool tech:

- Database: Postgres

- Server: Elixir (Phoenix, FLAME, Nx, Scholar, Axon, Bumblebee, Broadway)

- Client: ClojureScript (Reagent, Sync engine, Local-first, RTC)
