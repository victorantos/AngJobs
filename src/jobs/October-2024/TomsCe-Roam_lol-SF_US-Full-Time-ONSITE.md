Roam.lol -SF, US -Founding AI&#x2F; ML &amp; Python Engineer -Full-Time -ONSITE

Hey everyone! Roam is the TikTok for games; a game-driven social app, where every creator, artist &amp; influencer can make unique multiplayer games for their fans in minutes with the help of AI. We work with Rick &amp; Morty, Batman, Harry Potter, Lego Movie, Tom &amp; Jerry, 64 similar IPs as well as &gt; 300 Content Creators with 138M+ audience reach who have committed to making games on Roam and are signing new creators &amp; IPs daily.

Unlike UEFN or Roblox, which are limited to technical game developers, Roam provides tools for anyone to build personalized games, enabling 10,000x more games to be built annually by every creator &amp; social media user out there. TLDR: We can build the first true game-powered social app and grab a huge market share on the way.
