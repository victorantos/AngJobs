EthonAI - Senior DevOps Engineer - ONSITE&#x2F;HYBRID - Zurich, Switzerland - Full-time
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethon.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethon.ai&#x2F;</a>

We are a fast-growing AI startup with the goal of revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. We recently achieved a series A led by Index Ventures. Our software products are used by Fortune 500 companies and industry leaders across Europe and the US, such as Siemens, Lindt and Roche.

We&#x27;re after a Senior DevOps&#x2F;Cloud&#x2F;Infrastructure Engineer to take ownership of our software infrastructure and deployments. This position is ideal for a mid-career professional who is enthusiastic about complex software products, eager to grow their impact, and driven to build leadership skills in the trenches.

Buzzwords: AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Postgres, Python, Timescale, CI&#x2F;CD

(Please note: We typically don&#x27;t sponsor visas except in exceptional circumstances)

My take: We&#x27;re a small but high performing team, complete with ex-FAANGers and ETH PHDs. You&#x27;ll be helping me build out Platform Engineering with K8s as a greenfield project, along with supporting the companies current deployments. There&#x27;s the typical fast startup pace but our founders take WLB&#x2F;employee health very seriously.
