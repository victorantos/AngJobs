Our mission is to make authentication and authorization simple and secure for every developer building web and mobile applications. We want devs to stop worrying about auth and focus on building something awesome.

There are a lot of companies in this space, but we feel like we have something special:

* a unique deployment model (self-host or run in our cloud)

* API first from the ground up

* a relatively mature product (the code base is over eight years old and we&#x27;ve found and fixed a lot of the sharp edges around core login use cases, but there are plenty more features to write)

* founder-led (you can hear an interview from him here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liminal.co&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;a-developer-centric-approach-to-ciam-and-the-road-to-passwordless&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liminal.co&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;a-developer-centric-approach-to-c...</a>

* a full featured free-as-in-beer version that often makes the sales cycle easier; customers often come in having prototyped an integration already

If you are passionate about technology and want to join a company moving the industry forward, FusionAuth might be a great fit for you. Our core software is commercial with a &quot;free as in beer&quot; version. We also open source much of our supporting infrastructure. We are profitable but raised a round recently to accelerate our growth (more on that here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusionauth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fusionauth-funding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusionauth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fusionauth-funding</a> ).
