We&#x27;re a nonprofit on a mission to make research-backed learning strategies (such as spaced repetition) accessible in K-12 classrooms through our web app, Podsie. You&#x27;ll have significant ownership and impact on our product.

Ideal candidates:

- Are passionate about improving education (bonus if you&#x27;re a former teacher!)

- Have a strong bias for action and entrepreneurial spirit

- Are technically strong across the full-stack

- Have experience in smaller startups or roles with significant product ownership

We&#x27;re research-driven (eg. currently part of an NSF-funded project with CMU and Memphis), teacher-focused, and committed to measurable learning outcomes in under-resourced classrooms.
