Pilot.com - San Francisco - Senior Software Engineers, Staff Software Engineers, Engineering Managers - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pilot.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pilot.com</a> - Hybrid&#x2F;SF &amp; Remote (US)

Pilot runs your business’s financial back office so you don’t have to: our aim is to provide our customers with the same superpowers as large companies with full finance teams — superpowers that include having a deep understanding of financial health of the business, the machinery to constantly improve it, and the predictive abilities to thoughtfully plan for the future. We do this at a fraction of the cost a large company would pay for this, by delivering these capabilities through powerful software.

We care about building a thoughtful, high-trust culture that values ownership and shipping. We’re looking to hire teammates from different backgrounds and experiences and are hiring for a number of engineering roles:

* Software Engineer, Product (2-5yrs experience) 
* Senior Software Engineer, Product (5+ years experience) 
* Engineering Manager (2+ years of EM experience)

Pilot’s backend is written in fully typed Python 3.11, and our frontend is JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js. We use Terraform to manage our production infrastructure, and deploy Docker containers to ECS. AWS CodeDeploy powers our deployments and we rely on Honeycomb for our monitoring and Postgres as our database.
