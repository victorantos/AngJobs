Keeper - Product Manager, Full Stack Engineer - REMOTE within US - FULL-TIME - Office in San Francisco - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepertax.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keepertax.com&#x2F;</a>

More than 60M US workers (50% of Gen Z) have a freelance business or side hustle. Tax law is complicated, and many freelancers are overwhelmed and can’t afford a personal bookkeeper.

Keeper’s mission is to be their personal accountant. Keeper’s AI knows all the intricacies of tax law, responds in minutes instead of days, and creates a personalized tax flow for every user. By automatically finding write-offs and deductions, we save users an average of $6,000 every year.

We’re looking for a PM to own and design our tax filing product, and for engineers to help users with expense tracking and productionize AI features.
