Graphistry &#x2F; Louie.AI  - Senior security SE + community - USA REMOTE - graphistry.com&#x2F;careers

Graphistry is a Gartner-awarded visual graph AI startup used by cyber&#x2F;fraud&#x2F;BI&#x2F;supplychain&#x2F;misinfo&#x2F;... analysts to see, correlate, &amp; automate.

We recently launched our new product Louie.AI: A genAI-first analytics environment (notebooks, dashboards, automation, &amp; API) helps analysts talk directly with their many databases in natural language. Louie generates the queries, Graphistry GPU visualizations, &amp; Python analyses for them. Over time, Louie learns from the interactions, Python, queries, and other workflows from the team, making the investigation experience automatically improve over time.

Our team closely partners with companies like Nvidia &amp; AWS to build and market deep data tech ecosystems. For example, we created the web tier of Apache Arrow, incubated what became Nvidia RAPIDS.AI, were first known for our own server&lt;&gt;client GPU accelerated data visualization engine, and recently launched the OSS GFQL language for GPU-accelerated graph queries on large dataframes (&quot;faster Cypher and without the database baggage.&quot;)
