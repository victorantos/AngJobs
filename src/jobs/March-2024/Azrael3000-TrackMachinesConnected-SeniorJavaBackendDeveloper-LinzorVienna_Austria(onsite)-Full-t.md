Track Machines Connected - Senior Java Backend Developer - Linz or Vienna, Austria (onsite) - Full-time

We are a medium sized company with around 100 dedicated people, working on software (and a bit of hardware) for all sorts of railway applications. The team you would be joining is working on infrastructure measurement, think lidar data for object detection or stereo imaging for accurate positioning. The full job ad can be found here: [0]. The job will feature a nice combination of software development and hands-on work with the associated hardware. You certainly should be prepared to go out and work with our products in action on the machines produced by our mother company [1].

I&#x27;m leading this team, so if you are interested, reach out to me at arno.mayrhofer@[2] (applicants only, all others will be blocked)
