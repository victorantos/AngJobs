LifeWeb 360 - Product &#x2F; Generalist Role - Remote (US &amp; European Timezones) - Temporary 3-month role - Part or Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifeweb360.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifeweb360.com&#x2F;</a> - Techstars Company

LifeWeb is creating the place where anyone around the world can find out someone they care about has died, learn about them from others, and celebrate them authentically by sharing memoriesâ€”photos, videos, funny stories, inspiring tributes. Think social media, except not toxic. Death is a rare moment when we step back and reflect on how we want to live, and at LifeWeb we are tapping into this energy to help people make meaning in their own lives.

We&#x27;re on the pre-seed &#x2F; seed cusp. After a pivot from D2C to B2B, we&#x27;re post-revenue, growing with a clear GTM path, and iterating just shy of product-market-fit.

We need a generalist&#x2F;operations or product person full or part-time for ~3 months to augment our team on product and customer success while our Customer Success Lead is on maternity leave (April - June 2024). Opportunity to become a full-time employee if desired and a fit.

Bonus: If you&#x27;re a fan of the jobs-to-be-done framework for customer discovery, you can work directly with our advisor and co-creator of that framework, Bob Moesta!
