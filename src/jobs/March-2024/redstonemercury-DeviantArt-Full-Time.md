DeviantArt - Senior Site Reliability Engineer&#x2F;Senior DevOps Engineer&#x2F;Senior Infrastructure Engineer - US&#x2F;Canada - West Coast&#x2F;Mountain Time (Fully REMOTE but must be in one of those time zones) or Tel Aviv Israel (ONSITE) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviantart.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deviantart.com</a>

DeviantArt was founded in 2000 and has been a part of Wix since 2017. It is the largest online social network for artists and art enthusiasts. For emerging and established artists, DeviantArt is the foremost platform to exhibit, promote, and share works with an enthusiastic, art-centric community. We have over 86 million registered users worldwide, and our users -- lovingly referred to as “deviants” -- upload tens of thousands of original pieces of art every day, from more traditional art like painting and sculpture, to digital art, pixel art, films, anime, and AI art.

The DevOps team is a very small remote team that performs all tasks normally inclusive of SRE&#x2F;DevOps&#x2F;Infrastructure Engineers, with a bit of database administration mixed in. We are responsible for the day-to-day management of large-scale, mission-critical production systems that run on a public cloud. We automate, manage, and maintain the global infrastructure that makes DeviantArt tick. We respond to and mitigate all system issues. We develop and support the developer environment, and build and maintain CI&#x2F;CD pipelines.

This job requires generalist knowledge of a large complicated site infrastructure, excellent linux command line skills, some database skills, and an enjoyment of troubleshooting and solving complex issues, sometimes during system events and outages.
