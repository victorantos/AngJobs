gptengineer.app &#x2F; Lovable - ONSITE+HYBRID - Stockholm &#x2F; London - Full-Time - Founding Engineers, Founding Designer

Lovable is made up of a team of pragmatic previous (YC) founders and CTOs, set on being the first to make autonomous code generation work.

This is a hard problem. We believe we can do it by selecting a limited domain, a great AI driven UX and crucially - carefully selecting a single &#x27;AI-first&#x27; tech stack of open-source, that us engineers love to maintain. That we optimise the system of fine-tuned LLMs (+LMMs) to do well in.

We believe that rapid experimentation and hiring the brightest and most ambitious minds is the way we make this work. You&#x27;d be one of the first employees and have a big impact in shaping our product and company!

In particular we&#x27;re looking for a Founding Engineer to join our team of AI and product engineers building the software that builds other software.
