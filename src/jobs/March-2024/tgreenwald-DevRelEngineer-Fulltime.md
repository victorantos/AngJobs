We’re on a mission to simplify and streamline Workload Identity and Access Management for Kubernetes workloads, making it as easy as pushing code to Git.

As a DevRel Engineer with Otterize, you’ll be right in the thick of things. We’re talking about building relationships with the developer community, diving deep into tech with product and engineering teams, and creating technical content that turns heads. Crafting technical blog posts, articles, documentation, and developing step-by-step tutorials should be like second nature to you—plus, effortlessly interacting with the community on platforms such as Reddit and Stack Overflow.
