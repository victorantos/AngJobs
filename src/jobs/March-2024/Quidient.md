About: We&#x27;re a profitable start-up working on 5D Generalized Scene Reconstruction. Our engine can reconstruct full scenes or objects in real-time using a monocular RGB device and single image. All captures assets are measurable to a micron&#x27;s accuracy, and completely relightable in new conditions (including glass and mirrored surfaces).

We&#x27;re seeking someone with heavy experience in 3D computer vision applications and API-first to be a manager for our engine group.
