SEEKING WORK - remote

Location: West coast Canada.

Remote: Yes.

Technologies: Machine learning, Python, Tensorflow&#x2F;Keras&#x2F;pytorch, spark, Scala, AWS, kafka, HDFS, etc. A whole host of technologies over 20 year career. email in profile.

I&#x27;m an experienced Data scientist, who&#x27;s worked on a bunch of interesting projects. With Covid I&#x27;ve come to realize I need to work in public more often.

So an ideal fit would be a small&#x2F;medium company with hair on fire problems that need solving that I can talk about publicly.

What sort of problems do I like?

A Taxi company in latam hired me to built a fleet maintenance system. It predicted and scheduled preventative maintenance to reduce wear and tear and avoid breakdowns. We also identified the leading cause of wear - leadfoot drivers. So we built a system that would identify aggressive driving.

Another example was a speculative sports highlights annotation system I built with a consultancy. It ingested sports video and identified predetermined highlights in baseball - diving catches in our case. The ML pipeline was a CNN model which fed into an RNN. Given a bunch of video clips of diving catches as training data, it could later identify those diving catches and automatically annotate the video feeds.

Who shouldn&#x27;t contact me.

If your market is Ads or gambling I&#x27;m not interested. Sure there&#x27;s lot of money, but I&#x27;d rather sleep at night. Thanks.
