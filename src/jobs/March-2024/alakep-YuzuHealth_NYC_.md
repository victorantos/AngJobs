Yuzu Health. NYC.

We are:
Health insurance plan manager growing 10%+ m&#x2F;o&#x2F;m with a founding team of just 5 people. We are using technology to link together new incentive structures that work better than the traditional health insurance model to power employer sponsored plans.

Looking for: 
A full-stack builder, in person only. Someone who loves to build and wants to ship every day. Our technical challenges include complex data structures, interfaces, and integrations related to the financial layer of healthcare.

We believe that if we can abstract away the surprising complexity of running a health insurance plan then we can make health insurance more transparent and affordable.
