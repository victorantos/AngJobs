We want every patient to have a physician best friend: who tells them what their symptoms mean and where to go, who listens in on their critical appointments and explains the meaning of notes, and who gathers support from the community.

An end-to-end generative AI solution allows us to do that. As the first step, we have recently launched the worldâ€™s first LLM-powered symptom checker, MD&amp;Me (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdme.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdme.ai</a>). In less than two months, almost 10 thousand people used MD&amp;Me to get help with their medical problems. Their feedback has been outstanding and you can read more in our recent blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auxhealth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;intro-mdme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auxhealth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;intro-mdme</a>

Members of our founding team led development of the first LLM-powered patient interview system as part of a pre-chatGPT partnership with OpenAI, modeled user behavior at Meta, and trained at Harvard Medical School.

We are hiring for two roles:
