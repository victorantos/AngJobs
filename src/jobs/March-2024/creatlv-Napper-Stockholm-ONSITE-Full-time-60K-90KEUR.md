We are searching for passionate people:

A frontend-engineer to lead the app development (React Native) and be part of pushing the boundaries of product development. Someone who loves creating outstanding user experiences.

A full-stack engineer to work across our App (React Native), serverless API (TypeScript) and data&#x2F;ML infrastructure (Python). Someone excited to use all available tools and their full creativity to solve the wide range of technical challenges that scaling outstanding products includes.

Our philosophy is to hire selectively and invest heavily in the people who work with us.
