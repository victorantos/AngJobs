GA-CCRi - onsite (hybrid or full): VA, DC, UT - mid+ engineering roles - full-time

We usually hire remote (USA) but we&#x27;ve paused on that - feel free to drop a resume if you are willing to wait (weeks to months).

General Atomics - CCRi is solving fun and challenging problems in the geospatial domain. I&#x27;ve been a backend engineer at a few different places, and this is by far the best engineering culture I&#x27;ve found.

Our team of 250-ish people includes Data Scientists, Systems and DevOps Engineers, Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, Statisticians, Image Scientists, and other kinds of software developers and programmers, all of whom offer unique backgrounds to solve very difficult problems ranging from machine learning with neural networks to massive scale spatio-temporal analytics.

Working in Java mostly, with a few niche C++ and rust applications deployed in cloud and on-prem k8s. Can only accept US citizens due to security requirements.

Bonus points if you are cleared&#x2F;willing to get a security clearance!

Roles:

- DevOps engineer

- Frontend engineer

- Backend engineer

Salary:

- $90k+ (junior) to $230k+ (staff)

- paid out exempt hourly, I have never been asked to work more than 40hrs a week, but you can work a 48 hour week (or more) for a 20% raise if you want, too.
