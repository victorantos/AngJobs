We are looking for a motivated and experienced Senior Software Engineer to join our Platform&#x2F;Data Engineering team. In this role, you will be responsible for developing and optimizing data ingestion pipelines that can handle vast amounts of real-time and batch data from various sources. Your focus will be on designing systems that are scalable, reliable, and performant, as well as ensuring the proper integration of data across our entire ecosystem.

Trunk is an a16z funded dev tools startup, redefining software development at scale. We aim to solve problems that developers hate by bringing the tools usually built in-house at the best engineering orgs to every development team. We&#x27;ve built 4 products so far and have plans for more:

<pre><code>  * Code Quality: a universal linter&#x2F;formatter, available as a CLI, VSCode extension, and CI check;

  * Merge Queue: a merge queue, to ensure that PRs are tested in order before they&#x27;re merged; and

  * CI Analytics: detects, quarantines, and eliminates flaky tests from your code base. Prevents flakey tests from producing noise and blocking CI.

  *Flaky Tests: Detect and eliminate Flaky Tests.
</code></pre>
In 2022, we raised a $25M Series A led by Initialized Capital (Garry Tan) and a16z (Peter Levine)
