AngelList - Senior Software Engineers, Engineering Lead, Product Designer, Senior Data Engineer, etc - Full-time - Hybrid in San Francisco

AngelList&#x27;s mission is to accelerate innovation by providing startups and investors with the tools they need to succeed. We have the world’s largest early-stage venture portfolio with $17B+ assets under management and $124B+ on our platform, delivering capital to over 12,000 startups. We work with some of the best emerging fund managers to ensure every deserving startup has access to capital.

I was hired into the role from one of these HN threads last summer. One of the things that attracted me most was the density of former founders and aspiring entrepreneurs on the team.

We&#x27;re hiring full-stack engineers with experience building web applications at scale. Fintech knowledge is a plus, but not required.

I&#x27;m the hiring manager for our Funds Engineering team[0]. We’re building the data layer that powers our general ledger. We work on some of the most interesting datasets out there: We model capital flows in the venture ecosystem to understand where value accrues and, ultimately, which investors and founders win or lose.

I&#x27;d be happy to talk about these roles, about any open role we have at AngelList[1], or any questions you might about working here.
