Ameba - Full-stack Engineer - London - ONSITE - £100-130k + Equity

Join us in building Ameba, an AI platform that turns supply chain noise into knowledge.

If you&#x27;ve never considered working in supply chains before, everything around you, including the device you&#x27;re reading this on, has a story of how it got there. From raw materials to the final product in your hands, that story is its supply chain.

If you&#x27;re the kind of engineer who thrives on solving novel challenges, such as building modern data pipelines to construct a supply chain from unstructured communication streams, Ameba offers you the opportunity to build from first principles in a greenfield space.

We&#x27;re a seed startup made up of experienced entrepreneurs (who have previously raised $160m+, built supply chains for 30+ brands) and builders (formerly at Meta, Microsoft, Snap, Apple &amp; Palantir). We have big ambitions and are backed by the best investors in Europe, having raised over $9m since our launch just over a year ago — and we&#x27;re just getting started.

If you&#x27;re interested, please email me directly via craig (at) ameba (dot) ai with [HN] in the subject. Note we are currently unable to sponsor visas.
