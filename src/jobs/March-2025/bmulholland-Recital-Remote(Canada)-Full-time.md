Recital - Remote (Canada) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;recitalapp.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;recitalapp.com</a>

In-house lawyers waste 25% of their time looking for stuff. Recital uses non-obvious ML approaches, uniquely enabled by LLMs, to help them find it. We&#x27;re diving into the relatively-unexplored data buried in contracts, building layers of data analysis that are shown into an interface that feels simple and easy. It&#x27;s an AI product that doesn&#x27;t feel like an AI product.

We&#x27;re a small, global, all-remote startup. It&#x27;s our second startup in the space (the first was acquired). We follow modern product management (discovery) &amp; development (DORA) practices, emphasize developer experience as an accelerator of customer value, and use provably effective management techniques (Ã  la Manager Tools). Our team emphasizes strong emotional intelligence and self-awareness.

We&#x27;re looking for Canada-based senior+ full-stack developers, with solid professional experience in both Ruby on Rails and a modern frontend framework (Vue, React, etc). Experience in data wrangling is a bonus.
