Toontown: Corporate Clash - Volunteer&#x2F;unpaid position - Remote only (worldwide) - All experience level welcome

We are Toontown: Corporate Clash, an entirely not-for-profit MMORPG that is a fan reimagination of Disney&#x27;s defunct MMORPG, Toontown Online. Besides continuing the legacy of Toontown Online and bringing the MMO into the 21st Century, we also use our original IP to [raise funds for charities](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corporateclash.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;155" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corporateclash.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;155</a>) - we have raised over $54K for children&#x27;s health and LGBTQ+ charities.

We are on the lookout for a broad range of talents, from Tech to Art to Community Management! Everybody on the team is a volunteer - there is no salary, we do not solicit donations and all expenses are funded by our staff. We pride ourselves as being a training ground for up-and-coming talent to gain experience working on a real product in a 100+ strong team; some of our volunteers have used their experience with us to land jobs in and out of the industry.

We have lots of interesting tech problems that arises from building on top of a 20+ year old codebase (yes, Toontown development started out on Python 2.0!). We are especially interested in people with an interest in distributed systems, system administration, game physics and automation pipelines!

How much you want to contribute is up to you; our volunteers typically contribute 5-10 hours a week.
