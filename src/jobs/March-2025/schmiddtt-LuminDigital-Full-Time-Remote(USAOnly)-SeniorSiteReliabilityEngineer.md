We sell an unlabeled front-end application to credit unions and banks that allow millions to bank digitally with feature parity to large banks like Chase.

We run an AWS shop for the basic EKS&#x2F;insert managed service but also write our own services for internal use. We pride ourselves on trying new things, even if they don&#x27;t always pan out.

The SRE team at Lumin runs as a collaborative unit, with a &quot;part of the ship, part of the crew&quot; mentality. If you value being part of a tight knit team with the freedom to explore and innovate, apply!
