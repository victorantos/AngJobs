Parts Order - Sr Software Engineer (Backend&#x2F;Audio) - Remote (US&#x2F;CA&#x2F;EU) Hybrid (NYC)  - Full-time - $140k-$170k (US&#x2F;CA range; adjusted if international)

We are a seed-stage startup operating at the intersection of AI and audio engineering. We deliver best-in-class spatial audio mastering while significantly lowering the barrier to entry for artists, audio engineers, and labels alike.

We recently raised our seed round and are expanding our small team to build out the next phase of our platform. We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer who thrives in both creative prototyping and production-grade development. This role is ideal for a generalist with strong Python skills who is comfortable working with audio data. If you have a superpower—whether it’s building MVPs with React, tinkering with digital signal processing, or having absolute pitch—we’d love to hear about it!
