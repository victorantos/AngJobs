REMOTE (US)

COMPANY: fifo.com - Startup in the fintech space targeting self-employed individuals.

Remote, software dev position that uses primarily CoffeeScript and some HTMX, for the backend.

(CoffeeScript is JavaScript with a different syntax.)  The backend is in CoffeeScript, while the frontend is in JavaScript. Backend is most needed right now.

Email jenny@fifo.com with your intro&#x2F;resume (and&#x2F;or GitHub&#x2F;portfolio, if you have).

Could you let me know how many  hours are you looking to work per week? (We let you choose your schedule.)

Max hours that you’re able to give,  preferred.

What monthly salary you&#x27;d require to work  your max hours  for this position?

Also, where are you based? (For example: Are you a U.S. citizen? AT THE TIME BEING, USA-only.)

And include which days&#x2F;times you’re free to  a 30-60 minutes interview (it’s not a coding interview, so it’ll be convenient.)

I will respond back to your email scheduling when I’m free to interview.

Thank you!

Please email me at jenny@fifo.com for more details!
