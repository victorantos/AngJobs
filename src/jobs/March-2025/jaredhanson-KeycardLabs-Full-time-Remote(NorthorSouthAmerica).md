Keycard Labs - Founding Principal Engineer &amp; Founding Systems Engineer - Full-time - Remote (North or South America)

Keycard is on a mission to redefine machine identity for the AI Era — empowering developers to seamlessly connect people, agents, and services across networks, clouds, and applications. As generative AI and agent-based workflows grow more sophisticated, they demand real-time, adaptable access patterns. Keycard unlocks dynamic, identity-based credentials, ensuring every agent and service operates with precise, contextual permissions—creating a robust foundation for trusted AI systems.

We envision a global identity network, underpinned by open protocols, allowing distributed systems to adapt dynamically, scaling to handle complex AI workloads, and maintain cryptographically verifiable trust relationships. By rethinking secret management and machine identity from first principles, our goal is to delight developers, meet the performance demands of platform engineers, and establish new security primitives for cloud-native architectures — all in an inclusive, collaborative environment focused on consistent, high-quality execution and crafting products that developers love so much they bring them everywhere they go.
