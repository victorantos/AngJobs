<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;center.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;center.app</a> - Center Pixel, Inc - Engineering - Full-time - Palo Alto, CA &amp; Remote - 100k+ and up (we are flexible on salary since we&#x27;re venture-backed and still a 4-person team)
We build web3 developer tools and are most focused on solving the &quot;schlep&quot; types of problems that every team ends up building in house but shouldn&#x27;t have to.

Building stuff in crypto today is really hard. Imagine if you wanted to put up a personal website and all you had to do was start by breaking ground to build a data center. Your personal page probably would not be that good, would it? Small teams can only focus on so many things; we want them to use center so they can focus on the details that truly matter and make products beautiful.

We want to eliminate all of these annoying, cumbersome, expensive problems that devs face so that they can build incredible user experiences that help people flourish and rise to the level of their ambition, without having to think about if their nodes are online or if their indexer is missing any data.

We started about 3 years ago and have finally started to find product market fit. We&#x27;re looking to scale the engineering team so that we can finally bring our products to market.

Our investors include Founders Fund, Thrive Capital, SV Angel, @balajis, and many more incredible folks who have taken a chance on us; it&#x27;s been my mission for the last 3+ years to make sure that everyone involved in this venture does phenomenally well.
