Steward - Remote (US&#x2F;CANADA) or Hybrid (Seattle or Los Angeles) - Senior&#x2F;Staff Fullstack Engineer - $160k-190k + equity (US&#x2F;CA range; adjusted for geography if international)

We are a startup in the Wealthtech space looking to hire our  4th and 5th engineers.

We had a good experience posting in last month&#x27;s thread for a Lead Fullstack position, and wanted to post again--position is functionally the same, we&#x27;re growing so fast we feel we can add two more engineers instead of just one.

This is a great opportunity if you are looking to build something that leverages agentic AI to deliver practical value for families, and are interested in working on a product that places a high premium on UX.

Requirements:

* 8+ years of software engineering experience

* Familiarity with modern TypeScript and React, + at least one non-TS backend language

* Experience mentoring junior engineers and generally fostering a sophisticated engineering culture

* Track-record of mastering new technologies and diving into unfamiliar parts of the tech stack

Nice-to-haves:

* Experience with Python, Docker, AWS Fargate, or DynamoDB

* Experience writing unit tests for frontend components using tools such as Jest and Storybook

About the Engineering Team

Our engineering culture is collegial, both in the sense of being friendly, as well as placing an emphasis on continuous learning and refinement of our craft. We are very much into internal tooling, improving DevEx, and constant improvement of our processes.
