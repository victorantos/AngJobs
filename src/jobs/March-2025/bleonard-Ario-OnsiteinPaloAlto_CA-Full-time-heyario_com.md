Ario - Onsite in Palo Alto, CA - Full-time - heyario.com

I recently started at Ario where we are building an app for parents that uses AI to make things easier. We are targeting saving them one hour every day.
Previously, I co-founded Taskrabbit. That was somewhat similar but now it&#x27;s time to get LLMs in on the action!
It&#x27;s in the app store, but still early in the game, so we are looking for engineers to build it out. We are using Python and React Native.
