MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite

We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.

We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a software stack that lets us prototype on the fly. We have a pipeline full of exciting (building) projects and are making real revenue as a masonry contractor each month.

The full team is now about 45 people (and still growing fast!) There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building and we need talented people to meet it.

Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.

Other open roles:

- Software Engineer, Controls

- Software Engineer, Machine Vision

- Assembly&#x2F;manufacturing technicians and robot operators

P.S. We&#x27;re always on the lookout for very strong generalist engineers who can operate at any layer of the stack (firmware, networking, UI, application code - whatever&#x27;s needed!)
