Stealth Startup - joinus@hypesafe.ai - Member of Technical Staff - Alamo Square, San Francisco, CA (ONSITE) - Full Time

We have been quietly building a new type of general frontier model since mid 2024. We are reinventing the entire LLM stack for real work, focused on reliability and decision-making. We are well funded with a small and fast moving team previously from OpenAI, Google Brain, Meta and Scale.

Please check out our website: hypesafe.ai

If you are interested, please include the following in your email (to joinus@hypesafe.ai):

- Your resume + GitHub + LinkedIn

- What are some of your previous experiences that you feel proud to share?

- What do you think is the biggest bottleneck from LLMs automating more work? (Bonus points: go deeper than just “reliability”)

- If LLMs actually were reliable, which industries would you be the most excited to disrupt?

- What are you unusually good at? Tell us about something impactful that you made and loved making – feel free to brag a little ( :) ). What challenges&#x2F;obstacles did you overcome, and how did you choose the solutions or approach you did? In an ideal world, how would you want to apply your unique talents to your next role?

- Tell us about a time you received some tough feedback professionally. What was it? How did you respond to that experience? What did you take away from it?
