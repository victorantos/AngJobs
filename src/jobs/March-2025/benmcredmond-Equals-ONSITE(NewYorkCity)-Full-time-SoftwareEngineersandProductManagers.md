Equals - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;equals.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;equals.com</a> - ONSITE (New York City) - Full-time - Software Engineers and Product Managers

We&#x27;re building a new spreadsheet, connected to your Stripe, Salesforce and Hubspot data, and your SQL warehouse. We&#x27;re used by companies like Notion, Intercom, Descript, Attio, and more.

I sincerely believe we have some of the most interesting technical work you&#x27;ll find at a company of our size (17 people). Building a spreadsheet in the browser is hard!

For our PM role, you&#x27;ll be our first PM and own a very very broad surface area.

Backed by A16Z and Craft. Team is ex-Intercom, Amazon, Meta, etc.
