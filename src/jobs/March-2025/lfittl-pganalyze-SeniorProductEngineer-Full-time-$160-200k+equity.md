pganalyze - Senior Product Engineer - REMOTE (US&#x2F;Canada) - Full-time - $160-200k + equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pganalyze.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pganalyze.com</a>

At pganalyze, we&#x27;re redefining how developers optimize one of the world&#x27;s most popular databases, PostgreSQL. Our software gives companies like Atlassian, Robinhood, and Notion the tools to solve their most complex Postgres performance challenges, ensuring their mission-critical applications run smoothly at scale.

For our Product Engineering role you will be responsible for driving feature development from concept to writing code to deployment. Sometimes you might have to dig deep into Postgres internals to explain information correctly in a visual way. Recent examples of work done by our product engineers include the launch of our Query Tuning Workbooks feature, our Buffer Cache Monitoring functionality, or our integration with Plan Statistics provided by some Postgres-as-a-service providers.
