Tetmon - QA Automation Engineer - Remote - Full-time <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetmon.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetmon.com&#x2F;</a>

Flexible hours, minimal meetings, fully remote

Tech: TypeScript, Python, Nix&#x2F;NixOS

We have a suite of end-to-end tests that each spin up a virtual network from scratch to test our application. This test suite gates our automated release process and has been critical in allowing us to ship updates to users quickly and confidently. We&#x27;d like to expand it further and are looking for someone who cares about automation and correctness and can help us greatly expand what we test.

Part of the tests are written in Python (since that&#x27;s what the NixOS test infrastructure provides) and part of the tests are written in TypeScript (the parts that drive a headless web browser). We developed our own convenience library on top of Puppeteer that make tests easier to write and more reliable than Puppeteer, Playwright, or Taiko (all of which we used previously). The tests can run locally (on Linux&#x2F;MacOS development machines) and they run automatically on push to our build servers. The build servers are modern bare metal servers with Ampere and AMD CPUs with enough RAM to run dozens of test networks in parallel.

We have a simple review&#x2F;interview&#x2F;hiring process and low employee turnover.
