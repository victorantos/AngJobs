AbbVie - AI Engineer - Remote, Europe or US - Full-time

Are you a great coder (Python&#x2F;Typescript, but great skills are transferrable) with a solid foundation in the LLM&#x2F;ML world? Are you well versed in data engineering concepts, and excited to work with the latest GenAI models and bring these solutions into production with us? Then I&#x27;d love to hear from you!

We are a small team who care deeply about our work as well as each other. We iterate fast, and err in the side of showing a quick prototype of an idea, rather than spending hours in meetings talking about it.

Our vision for this project is extremely ambitious, and you will be a crucial part of making this a reality.

If you fit the above description, hit me up at jakob.hoppermann@abbvie.com
