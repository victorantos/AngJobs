Blackshark AI - Software Engineer &amp; Senior DevOps Engineers - Full-time - Austria or Remote EU - VISA sponsorship available

Satellite and drone imagery access is on the rise, and traditional image processing methods are struggling to keep up. Our scalable AI quickly extracts global features, providing real-time, on-demand geospatial insights with impressive speed and accuracy. We are turning months of manual work into mere minutes, and with much better results. We work with customers from various domains, from intelligence and defence, local and federal governments, to small and large enterprise enterprises, which requires us to have a lot of flexibility on how we deploy and maintain our services.

We kicked off in 2020 and have secured $35 million in series A funding from a lineup of top US and European investors, among which Microsoft M12, Point72 Ventures, Maxar, In-Q-Tel, SAFRAN, and ISAI&#x2F;Capgemini.

Geospatial: RasterIO, GDAL, QGIS, ArcGIS

Infrastructure: Kubernetes &amp; Docker, Linux, AWS &amp; Azure, Azure DevOps, Terraform, ELK, Prometheus &amp; Grafana, ArgoCD &amp; Helm
