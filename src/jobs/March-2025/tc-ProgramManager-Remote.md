Rust Project&#x2F;Foundation - Program Manager - Remote

Rust is a programming language that helps people build reliable and efficient software at scale.  It&#x27;s a language that many people love.

The members of the Rust Project work together to build and advance this language and its related tooling and infrastructure.  We take a particular pride in shipping tools that are stable and well polished.

We&#x27;ve lately been doing more explicit program management as part of our ongoing work to improve and scale our processes for shipping our language and these high quality tools.  We&#x27;ve developed systems and standards for this that have proven to work well within the Rust Project, and we&#x27;ve been seeing substantial value from this work being done in the context of our edition and project goal programs.

We&#x27;re now looking to hire some sharp and talented individuals to support and advance these systems and this work.  That&#x27;s where you come in.
