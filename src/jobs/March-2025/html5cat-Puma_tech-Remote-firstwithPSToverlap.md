Puma.tech - Remote-first with PST overlap - Engineering &amp; Growth - $75-150k base &amp; 200k+ equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech</a>

Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma.tech. Previously worked  as software engineer &amp; developer advocate at Cloudant (YC S08, Acq. by IBM), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11, Acq. by Meta), and explored Ai&#x2F;ML (computer vision for self-driving cars).

*Puma Browser* is focused on making LLMs easy to use on your mobile phone. Private by design.

We recently shipped an update with local DeepSeek R1 and it’s amazing how fast and capable it is even on iPhone 14 Pro.

Next step is making it do things for you, like a helpful assistant, and we’re excited to explore what the world of agents would look like.

We’ve raised Angel and Pre-Seed Rounds from some of the best builders in crypto and Ai: Illia Polosukhin (NEAR Protocol), Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake CEO, Neeva, Greylock), Jason Warner (cofounder at poolside.ai, ex-GitHub CTO), Chris Larsen (founder of Ripple), Don Ho (Orange DAO, Quantstamp), Protocol Labs, SBI, Fenbushi, HashKey and more.

- We value Optimism, Kindness, Curiosity, Speed and Grit.

- Only two recurring weekly meetings to maximize state of flow: Monday all-hands, Friday Demos.

- Careful with growth and never had to do layoffs.

Open Roles: Eng (iOS, Android, Ai&#x2F;ML, Browser Extensions), Based Social Media Intern; Internships: Eng, Design, Growth
