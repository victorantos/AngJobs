Seen Finance - Multiple Roles - Full time - Berlin and Chicago - Hybrid on-site - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seen.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seen.com</a>
At Seen, we believe that everyone deserves a fair opportunity to (re)build their credit. We understand how tough it can be to qualify for a credit card when your credit score isn&#x27;t where you want it to be.

Seen is a new fintech company, started in 2023 following the acquisition of Sable (YC S19) by Snap Finance. We&#x27;ve recently launched a credit card in the US for people with less than ideal credit. We plan to offer other exciting credit products in the future.

It&#x27;s a great time to join as the team is small (10 engineers) and we&#x27;re growing fast. We&#x27;re a startup but we&#x27;re also lucky to have the financial support and customer base from our parent company.

We&#x27;re hiring in Berlin for:

* VP of Analytics

* Senior Software Engineer

* Staff Software Engineer

We&#x27;re hiring in Chicago for:

* Senior Data Engineer

* Staff Data Engineer.

Our software is written in Typescript. We use React and React Native. Our data stack uses dbt, Python and BigQuery.
