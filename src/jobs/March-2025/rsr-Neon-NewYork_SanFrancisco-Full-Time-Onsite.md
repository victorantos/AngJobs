Neon - New York, San Francisco - Full-Time - Onsite

There’s a massive transition happening in the video games industry right now. Gaming has become a full-blown cultural movement, and many fail to appreciate how it has already become the dominant form of leisure and entertainment for an entire generation.

But as culture has evolved, technology has advanced, and more people have gravitated toward games, the industry incumbents that run the show haven’t kept up. Our big bet is that by empowering game creators with better technology, we&#x27;ll make the entire ecosystem more welcoming, connected, efficient, creative, and fun for all.

We’re an early stage startup backed by Thrive Capital, Griffin Gaming Partners, Ribbit Capital and a16z&#x27;s inaugural SPEEDRUN class. Our mission is to help game creators achieve independence by building the tools they need to start, run, and scale their businesses.
