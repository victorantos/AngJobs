Sanctuary Computer - Internet of Things Technical Lead - Remote (with office in NYC) - Full-time - NYC

At Sanctuary Computer — we’re building a different type of technology shop. Based in NYC’s Chinatown (and remote), the way we approach building things is more like a restaurant than a traditional agency, with an emphasis in providing our clients with an outspoken sense of comfort and hospitality.

We’re looking for an Internet of Things Technical Lead with experience leading projects and collaborating closely with product owners.

You’ll be joining our team as a senior developer eager to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to our clients&#x27; complex problems. You would be tasked to lead technical direction for connected hardware products — consumer devices, bespoke operating systems like the Light Phone OS, and the digital ecosystems of phone apps and web interfaces that talk to them. You might identify as a Technical Lead, a Technical Architect, or a Technical Program Manager, and — as you might expect with “technical” in the title — you would be the person on the project team most responsible for delivering the most appropriate and cost-effective technical solution for the client’s needs.
