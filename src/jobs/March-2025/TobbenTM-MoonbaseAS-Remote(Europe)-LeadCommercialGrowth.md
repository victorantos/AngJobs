Moonbase AS - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moonbase.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moonbase.sh</a> - Remote (Europe) - Part-time &#x2F; co-founder - Lead Commercial Growth

Moonbase is building the ultimate e-commerce platform for indie software developers. We&#x27;re already trusted by innovative indie studios and growing fast—with zero marketing. Now, we need YOU to take us to the next level.

This is your chance to shape and lead the commercial side of a high-potential startup from the ground up. We&#x27;re talking strategy, marketing, sales, partnerships — the whole package.

We&#x27;re a bootstrapped startup, building a lifestyle company, and are looking at bringing on a third founder to help us cover what we don&#x27;t do well today. So if this appeals to you, get in touch with me at tobias@moonbase.sh or read more here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehub.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;67a512995a0d1e7c9ade895f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehub.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;67a512995a0d1e7c9ade895f</a>
