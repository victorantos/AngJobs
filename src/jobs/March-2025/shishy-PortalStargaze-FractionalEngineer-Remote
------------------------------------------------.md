Portal Stargaze - Fractional Engineer - Part time, 10-20 hours&#x2F;week, $100-$150&#x2F;hr (potentially full-time later) - Remote
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portal Innovations invests in ecosystems to support life sciences entrepreneurs in different geographies in the US. We use Stargaze, our AI-toolkit for identifying and sourcing innovation to make strategic decisions around:

- Finding rising star researchers to support

- Understanding where science is headed

- Forming high-impact relationships with researchers, founders, investors, and pharmaceutical companies

As we continue to build out this &quot;frontend for biotech innovation&quot;, we need a seasoned engineer to help us accelerate our roadmap for 2025.

Here&#x27;s a snapshot of what you&#x27;ll work on with me:

- Build ETL pipelines (bringing in data around publications, patents, etc.). We&#x27;ve made good progress here, but need someone who can get it over the finish line.

- Build an internal data infrastructure that allows us to iterate on data science experiments to create new Innovation Biomarkers

- Work with our team to evaluate and benchmark different models and pipelines to classify innovators, resolve entities across datasets, generate high quality matches for innovation search, and more

- Occasionally work across the stack (React &#x2F; Next, Python, Postgres) if you&#x27;re interested in branching out

You&#x27;re a great fit if you:

- Have experience with Python, Postgres, and general ETL pipelines &#x2F; infrastructure (AWS, Modal, Airflow)

- Take your craft seriously and own your work

- Aren&#x27;t afraid of getting into the weeds

- Work well asynchronously but appreciate the occasional meeting to iron out any blockers

Bonus points if you:

- Enjoy reading about machine learning &amp; data science or have trained and deployed models in the past

- Have an interest in the biotech innovation space
