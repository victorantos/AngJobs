Rabbet (YC S17) - Sr. Software Engineer (Elixir&#x2F;React) - REMOTE (TX, NC, CO) - Full time

Rabbet is hiring Sr. Software Engineers to help us streamline construction finances. We offer cloud-based software for commercial lenders and real estate developers to centralize construction finances, automate administrative tasks, and reduce the time spent managing draws.

Backend is in Elixir (Phoenix&#x2F;Absinthe&#x2F;postgres), frontend is React (mostly JS with more new stuff in TS). The company is ~20 people with 6 of us on the engineering team. Looking to add another 3-4 engineers over the next ~6 months.

We are fully remote, though we do require candidates to be in TX, NC, or CO (exceptions possible if you have several years of professional Elixir experience). We don&#x27;t currently offer sponsorship.
