Branch - Ecommerce Product Manager &#x2F; Hybrid PM + Dev - Remote Friendly EST (NYC &#x2F; Toronto Preferred)

Branch makes and sells work products for remote workers and growing teams. We&#x27;re looking for a Digital Product Manager or hybrid PM &#x2F; dev to lead the development of our ecommerce site and systems. You’ll ship beautiful, functional and accessible commerce experiences addressing both our enterprise and DTC customer segments, as well as full-stack applications to support our operations and broader enterprise ambitions.

As the only product management hire at Branch, you’ll have the opportunity to lead a product practice at a well-funded and rapidly-growing startup pursuing a unique opportunity that anchors in online commerce and extends far beyond it.

What we&#x27;re looking for: as a pure PM, 2-5 years of relevant product management experience (preferably at a high-growth ecommerce startup) OR experience founding an ecommerce business, reps managing a sprint planning process and owning a product roadmap, deep knowledge of Shopify Plus and the Shopify ecosystem, strong portfolio featuring experience shipping exceptional features that users love, and comfort shipping low or no code features. We would also be very excited to hire a developer with 2-4 years of front-end development experience, ideally within the Shopify Plus ecosystem, with an interest in pivoting to product and a willingness to plan and build at the same time.

Open to any remote candidates in EST (or willing to work those hours), with NYC and Toronto preferred. If interested, email hn [at] branchfurniture.com with a few sentences about your background and interest, along with your favorite and least favorite things about the Shopify platform.
