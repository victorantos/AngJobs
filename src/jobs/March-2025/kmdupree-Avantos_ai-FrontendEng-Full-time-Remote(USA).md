Avantos.ai - Frontend Eng - Full-time - Remote (USA)

Series A AI Fintech Startup headquartered in NYC. If youâ€™re outside of NYC, we&#x27;d like you to make quarterly visits and are happy to support higher-frequency visits.

You&#x27;ll get a sense of what we&#x27;re building during the coding challenge, which you can start by sending a POST request to:

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply-to-avantos.dev-sandbox.workload.avantos-ai.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply-to-avantos.dev-sandbox.workload.avantos-ai.net</a>

Payload should be this:

{&quot;email&quot;: &quot;&lt;your-email&gt;&quot;}

You&#x27;ll need to make sure the user agent isn&#x27;t something too bot-seeming or WAF will block you. (Sorry we&#x27;re a startup no time to fix.) This user agent works: Mozilla&#x2F;5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit&#x2F;537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome&#x2F;133.0.0.0 Safari&#x2F;537.36
