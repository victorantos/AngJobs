Puraido - Senior&#x2F;Staff Backend&#x2F;Fullstack SWE - On-site&#x2F;Hybrid&#x2F;Remote - Bangkok (Thailand) - Full-time

At Puraido, we&#x27;re building a B2B payment orchestration platform focused on recurring payments. Our system integrates multiple payment gateways into a single easy-to-use platform. It handles order processing, payments, email notifications, third-party callbacks and risk management. We face ongoing challenges from the constantly changing payment landscape with each payment channel requiring immense flexibility from our platform.

We aim to develop high-grade software by providing our developers the space and time to create solutions that make sense from both engineering and business perspectives. We make as few shortcuts as possible. We&#x27;re building for the future and scaling up as a first-grade SaaS to attract new types of clients, while remaining focused on our existing clients&#x27; needs. This gives our project - in my opinion :) - a unique edge.

Our informal team works from a large penthouse-style office in central Bangkok, with plenty of space to work, relax and socialize. We offer both remote and flexible on-site positions to accommodate our engineers from various nationalities across the globe. All positions come with competitive salaries aligned with Thai market standards and we can offer visa sponsorship.

We are looking for:

- Senior&#x2F;staff level backend developer

- Senior&#x2F;staff level frontend (fullstack) developer

Our tech stacks:

- Backend: Kotlin&#x2F;Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate&#x2F;JPA, ActiveMQ&#x2F;JMS, PostgreSQL

- Frontend: TypeScript, Next.js, React, PostgreSQL

- Infra: AWS, EKS&#x2F;Kubernetes, Helm, RDS, Terraform, GitLab CI&#x2F;CD
