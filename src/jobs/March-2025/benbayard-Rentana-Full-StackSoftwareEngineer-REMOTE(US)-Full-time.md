Rentana is a fast-growing startup transforming revenue management for the multifamily housing industry with our AI-powered platform. In this role, you&#x27;ll report directly to our CTO and work in a small, agile team where every idea counts and your impact is visible across the entire product.

We’re seeking a talented Full-Stack Software Engineer to design and implement greenfield projects—ranging from scalable backend systems that normalize messy third-party data to robust data pipelines and improved UI&#x2F;UX.
