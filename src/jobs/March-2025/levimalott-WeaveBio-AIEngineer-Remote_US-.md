Weave Bio - AI Engineer - Remote, US -

We&#x27;re looking for an AI engineer with a bio background. We&#x27;re building the first AI-enabled regulatory platform for drug development. The existing processes to submit regulatory submissions to government bodies is extremely time consuming and expensive (plus no one likes paperwork). We&#x27;re building a SaaS platform powered by LLMs to dramtically reduce the time spent producing regulatory documents (97% reduction in current benchmarks).
