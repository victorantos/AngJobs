MacStadium is hiring for some super important roles.

Specifically, we&#x27;re looking to make our first SRE hire at the intersection of Kubernetes and MacOS virtualization.

We&#x27;re also looking to hire a team of developers (including a lead) for migrating our back-office admin and GraphQL API from a mix of TypeScript and PHP to Django. You can apply to either the IC or lead role through the &quot;Automation Engineer&quot; posting.
