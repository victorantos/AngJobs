Sanctuary Computer - Senior Software Engineer (Backend, Native Android or iOS) - Remote (with office in NYC) - Full-time - NYC

At Sanctuary Computer — we’re building a different type of technology shop. Based in NYC’s Chinatown (and remote), the way we approach building things is more like a restaurant than a traditional agency, with an emphasis in providing our clients with an outspoken sense of comfort and hospitality.

We’re looking for a senior generalist software engineer with expertise in backend and&#x2F;or native app development, and interest in systems architecture and IoT.

In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems. You would work on full-stack apps across many industries, from e-commerce to connected hardware products — including projects like the Light Phone OS.
