Felt - Senior Infrastructure Engineer, Growth Product Manager - Oakland, CA or REMOTE (US only) - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com</a>

Felt is building a cloud-based geographic information systems (GIS) solution and have hundreds of customers already using it to run their operations, processing terabytes of data. Our team hails from Uber, Google, Meta, CARTO, Mapbox, The New York Times and a few others. If you have used online maps in the past few years, you have used their work. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I&#x27;m an early Uber engineer.

We are on the lookout for a Senior Infrastructure Engineer who will help build our GIS architecture in the cloud. Felt built the world&#x27;s most advanced cloud-native GIS systems. We are able to processes almost all types vector, raster, and tabular data you can throw at it. You can throw a basic CSV or a multi-band raster file with NDVI encoding. Felt can also natively connect to STAC repositories, process data from your Snowflake installations, or download things from your Redshift.

We are looking for a senior or a staff level engineer who will help us take this architecture to next level. We are always adding support more types of files and connectors. We also have some ongoing projects to make this infrastructure more modular and work in VPCs.

Ideal candidates will have experience working with infrastructure as code tools such as Cloudformation, CDK, Terraform or similar. We handle many different types of data on a daily basis and it&#x27;s key that we iterate really fast; our IaC tools enable us to do that with confidence.

Also, for the first time, we are hiring a product manager that is going to be focused on our growth funnels within our service. This person will own the onboarding journey and help those first-time customers become loyal users.
.
Ideal candidates will have 4+ years of experience focus on growth and onboarding within B2B SaaS and&#x2F;or PLG companies. They will have a proven track record, own metrics such as time to value, be comfortable owning touchpoints, and designing and running experiments.

We are well-funded and just raised our $15M Series A. You can read more about it our funding here [5], and our announcement here [6]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[7]
