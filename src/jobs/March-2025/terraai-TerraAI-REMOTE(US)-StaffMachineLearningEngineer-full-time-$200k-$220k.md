TerraAI - REMOTE (US) - Staff Machine Learning Engineer - full-time - $200k-$220k

TerraAI is trying to tackle climate change by helping the world hit its electrification goals via copper extraction.

In the same way image generators have shown the remarkable ability to produce a diverse set of realistic pictures conditioned on a text prompt (and other inputs), we are developing a generative model that produces 3D geological models conditioned on geophysical surveys, bore hole measurements, and other forms of physical observation. The outputs of the generative capture what we know and donâ€™t know about the state of the subsurface, allowing explorers to make maximally informed decisions about how and where to explore for critical resources.

We are looking for a talented deep learning engineer or scientist to lead the development of this model that will revolutionize decision making in the earth subsurface for a wide range of clean energy applications.
