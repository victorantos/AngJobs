Margins - [Backend, Data, iOS] - REMOTE (SF Bay Area preferred) - Full-time

We&#x27;re building a home for readers online, starting with an iOS app to track and discover books: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;margins.app&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;margins.app&#x2F;download</a>

We just went from 0 to 100k users in 2 months, raised a seed, and are now hiring 2-3 more engineers. If &quot;craftsmanship&quot; and &quot;books&quot; resonates, we&#x27;d love to chat: paul@margins.app

SwiftUI, TypeScript, some Python, GraphQL, Postgres, Supabase, Vercel
