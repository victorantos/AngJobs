InnoVint - Wine Production Software - Remote (US-based) - FT - Senior BE Developer (Django&#x2F;Python)

We&#x27;re looking for another great back end developer to join our team.  We are a company of 30 large and have been operating for over 10 years. We are *not* VC backed and operate as an independent company with startup mentality.

InnoVint is the world&#x27;s leading SaaS solution for wineries and wine producers. We are and have always been a well-performing, tight knit virtual team that meets several times a year in the real world (usually a wine destination!). About half the team has some wine production experience. If you love the idea of being part of the wine industry, but haven&#x27;t yet considered combining your experience in SaaS and tech, maybe InnoVint is the perfect company for you. If you are a reformed or aspiring winemaker, that&#x27;s even better!

This is a great opportunity to work with an excellent and passionate team, serving a really fun and interesting market - commercial wineries. If you&#x27;re interested in a more concrete visual understanding of InnoVint&#x27;s market leading wine production software, here&#x27;s a short video showing the software in action: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hNBBZz08DWY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hNBBZz08DWY</a>
