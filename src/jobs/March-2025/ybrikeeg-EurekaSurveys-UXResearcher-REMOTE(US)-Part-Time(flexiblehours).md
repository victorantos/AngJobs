Eureka Surveys - UX Researcher - REMOTE (US) - Part-Time (flexible hours)

Eureka Surveys (eurekasurveys.com) is one of the largest survey panels in the US, connecting Fortune 500 companies with the opinions of everyday people. We&#x27;re a small, engineering-first team with a massive user base (9 million and growing!), and we&#x27;re looking for a talented UX Researcher.

About the Role:

- Remote: Work from anywhere within US time zones.
- Part-Time: Flexible hours (3-5 hours&#x2F;week) to accommodate your schedule.
- UX Research Focus: Conduct in-depth user interviews, uncover user motivations, and leverage AI tools to record, summarize, and synthesize insights. We structure our user interviews to answer on one key question we have about the user&#x27;s behavior (i.e When you invited your friend to install Eureka, how did you explain the app to them?). This is done in a 10-15 phone call.

What We&#x27;re Looking For:

- Strong qualitative research experience, specifically user interviews.
- Comfort with AI-assisted research platforms and tools.
- Deep curiosity about user behaviors and motivations.
- Ability to clearly communicate findings and insights.

To Apply:

Please send a brief introduction and relevant experience or portfolio examples to kirby@eurekasurveys.com. We&#x27;re excited to hear from you!
