Hi, I&#x27;m Vasek. CEO of E2B (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2b.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e2b.dev</a>). We&#x27;re building an open-source infrastructure for AI code interpreting&#x2F;code execution in our Sandboxes.

We have customers like Perplexity, Vercel, Hugging Face, You.com, and a lot of new exciting startups building in AI space. We have revenue, are growing, and raised over $11M. We&#x27;re hiring engineers all over the board to work on our infrastructure, SDKs, AI projects, and user dashboard.

We&#x27;re a team of 15, the core team is immigrants from Europe that moved to San Francisco. We work from our office in SF and in newly opened office in Prague. Both are in-person. Two technical co-founders that have known each other for 15 years.

We&#x27;re looking for:

- Distributed systems engineer to work on our infrastructure that&#x27;s powered by Firecracker and Nomad.

- AI engineer to help us build more opinionated AI codegen tools on top of our sandboxes (think our version of Next.js)

- DevRel engineer to help us inspire more developers by creating mini projects, examples, integrations, and help us with our Discord community.

If this sounds interesting to you, shoot me an email at vasek at e2b.dev. We&#x27;ve found some great people on HN before so looking forward to hearing from you!
