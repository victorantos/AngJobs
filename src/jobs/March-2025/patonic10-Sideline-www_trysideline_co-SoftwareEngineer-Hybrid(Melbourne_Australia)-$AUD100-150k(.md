Sideline - www.trysideline.co - Software Engineer - Hybrid (Melbourne, Australia) - Considering Full-time&#x2F;Part-time&#x2F;Contract - $AUD100-150k (pro rata)

EDIT: I am only considering applicants based in Melbourne at this stage.

Sideline is a rapidly growing SaaS product for law firms that enables a track changes feature for draft emails within Outlook.

Around 30 law firms are currently using the product across three continents. Sales have been inbound. The company is bootstrapped. I am the sole founder looking for somebody to take the lead on the technology side so I can focus on growing the business.

Sideline is a web application. You will have full ownership of the codebase and SaaS infrastructure. You will interact directly with customers, being included in product feedback calls and some sales meetings.

Technologies used: JavaScript (some jQuery - not for long), TypeScript, Node.js, Azure, MS Graph APIs, Office JavaScript APIs. Note this is not a .NET&#x2F;VSTO&#x2F;COM Add-in.

Background on me: I was a corporate lawyer for 10+ years, as well as doing a bit of legal tech consulting, before founding Sideline. Iâ€™m active on LinkedIn.
