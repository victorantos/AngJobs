Hi, Pedro, lead recruiter from Altar.io here.
We&#x27;re a software house that wants its clients (early-stage startups, entrepreneurs) to thrive. We came together from various backgrounds with one vision: to bring a lean, user-centric approach to product innovation and software development by completely understanding the business needs before building anything.

Stack - node&#x2F;express, angular&#x2F;react, MongoDB&#x2F;PostgreSQL. 
~50 strong total team, ~20 devs.

Fully remote but must be Portugal-based. (Office in Lisbon, visits are fully voluntary).
