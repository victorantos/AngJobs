supersonik.ai - Founding Software Engineers - ONSITE Barcelona (we help relocate), REMOTE (exceptional cases) - Full-time

We just raised a $5M seed from a top-tier fund to build real-time AI agents that interact through voice and complex UI automation. The technical challenges are really big. We&#x27;re hiring founding engineers: people who love coding, hacking, and building hard things from scratch.

You&#x27;ll join early, have ownership from day one, and work alongside a team in Barcelona (we&#x27;ll help you move). Remote is possible, but only for extraordinary cases.

If this sounds like your kind of challenge, email us: hiring at supersonik.ai
