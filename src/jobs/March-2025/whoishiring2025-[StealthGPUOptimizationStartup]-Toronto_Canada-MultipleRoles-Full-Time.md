[Stealth GPU Optimization Startup] - Toronto, Canada - Multiple Roles - Hybrid&#x2F;Onsite - Full-Time

A trillion dollars in GPU compute power will be deployed this decade. We are building the framework and tools that will enable them to operate at full capacity. We are looking to expand on our engineering side and are interested in hiring people who can demonstrate proficiency in writing C&#x2F;C++ code, CUDA, Python and a good understanding of a GPU internal operation.

No bullshit interview process. I would probably talk to you for around half an hour about what you’ve done related to this. I may ask to see some code you’ve produced in the past. No take-home assignments. If there’s promise, you may be asked to work one or two weeks with us, paid.

If you are a student or just graduated, we have a couple internship spots. We don’t mind training people if they show strong interest and adequate fundamental skills.
