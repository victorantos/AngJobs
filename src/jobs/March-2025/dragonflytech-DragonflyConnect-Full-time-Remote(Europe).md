Dragonfly Connect - Full-time - Remote (Europe)

Weâ€™re an early stage start-up working at the intersection of system design, cloud infrastructure and AI to accelerate the adoption of modern tools and technologies. Our goal is nothing less than to enable businesses of all sizes and shapes to leverage best-of-class technologies and latest advancements in GenAI, including agentic frameworks.

We are currently in #StealthMode, but recently raised a hefty pre-seed fund from Tier 1 investors with additional contributions from some awesome angels to bring the vision to life. We are now in build mode and have already partnered up with 20+ world renowned brands to bring the product to the market.

Sounds exciting? This is a rare opportunity to join at the earliest stage and build the foundations of a generational product.
