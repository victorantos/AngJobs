Bloomberg - Software Engineer - Infrastructure - ONSITE in New York, Princeton, London - Full-time

Bloomberg is hiring experienced software engineers to build high-performance infrastructure that powers real-time financial data for global markets. We process massive datasets from regulatory agencies, exchanges, central banks, and financial institutionsâ€”fueling Bloomberg products and AI-driven insights. Our work directly impacts traders, analysts, and decision-makers worldwide.

We tackle hard distributed systems problems at scale, from low-latency data processing to cloud&#x2F;hybrid computing, leveraging cutting-edge open-source &amp; proprietary technologies.

I joined Bloomberg in 2020 via its acquisition of Second Measure (YC S15) and stayed because of the challenging problems and the freedom to solve them. Bloomberg values deep technical expertise and gives engineers real ownership over impactful projects.

We&#x27;re hiring for roles in these locations with 3-days in office most weeks:
