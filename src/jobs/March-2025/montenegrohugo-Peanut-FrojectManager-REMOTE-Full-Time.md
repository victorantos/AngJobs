Peanut - Froject Manager - REMOTE - Full-Time - &gt;= $40-110k + 0.5-2% equity

We&#x27;re bringing currency back to cryptocurrency. We care a LOT about UX and are at the forefront of chain and account abstraction. Weâ€™re making crypto actually usable as a currency and not just a degenerate gambling fiesta.

We are VC-funded ($1.4m pre-seed), advised by heavyweights like ex-venmo CTO, and founded by Harvard alum.

Apart from Project Manager, we have some other roles we&#x27;re hiring for. Review and find them here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peanut.to&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peanut.to&#x2F;jobs</a> (and list HN as the place you learned about us!)
