95% of companies are still wasting time manually testing due to shortcomings in Playwright, Cypress, and other frameworks. Developers rank testing as the #1 blocker to release.

We&#x27;ve built an AI Agent that performs manual testing on it&#x27;s own VM with complete desktop access. It works like a specialized &quot;Claude Computer Use.&quot;

We&#x27;re scaling our early sales and seeking QA engineers, customer support, and sales engineers.
