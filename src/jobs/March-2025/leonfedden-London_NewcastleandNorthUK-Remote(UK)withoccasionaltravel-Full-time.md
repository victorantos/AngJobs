Hey this is Leon, the CTO at Literal Labs. At Literal Labs, we build state of the art Machine Learning algorithms for the Edge and other targets that go brrr.

We are looking for a Mid-Senior Frontend Dev. If I&#x27;m being honest, it would be great to find someone that really cares about the aesthetics, and design, so the user has a great experience. Because we are a start up, it would also help if you are happy to do the odd bit of CI or backend work - but read more here:

This role is remote, though the right to work for a UK-registered company is required. Read here for more about how we work:

And here more generally about some of the the company&#x27;s technology (Tsetlin Machines):

But we are building out other techniques too!

We will offer you:

1. Impact: An opportunity to join an exciting deep tech startup that will challenge conventional thinking in Edge AI and TinyML.

2. Career progression: We are a small company so you will have an opportunity to shape the role depending on your strengths and ambitions (I promise to help you as much as I can here).

3. Friendly, knowledgeable teammates: Our team is experienced and enjoys sharing knowledge. We document our work, hold literature reviews and casual show and tells to help each other grow professionally.

4. Flexibility: We are a remote team and this provides you with genuine flexibility over where and how you work in collaboration with our team.

5. Unlimited Holiday: Beyond the UK minimum (20 days + 8 bank holidays), we offer the option to take additional paid holiday within reason and mutually convenient.

6. Equity: All permanent employees will receive meaningful share options in the company; we are currently in the process of implementing the option pool.

7. Pension: Literal Labs will contribute 5% of qualifying earnings to your pension.

In general, I&#x27;m determined to make Literal Labs a really positive experience for everyone working with us.
