--------

At Rally, we believe *talking to your users* is the key to building great products and the single most important thing a product team can do.

To enable teams to talk to their users as fast as possible, we’ve built the most powerful User Research Platform that consolidates all the steps needed to talk to your users into a single tool.

By building Rally with a focus on scale, flexibility and quality, we’ve become the platform of choice for the biggest research teams in the world (StackOverflow, GitLab, MongoDB, Discord).

Since the start of Rally, we’ve been a fully remote company. While we have a strong remote first culture, we also value the importance of connecting with your teammates in person. We prioritize quarterly in-person offsites for the entire team with expenses fully paid for. Additionally, we offer a work-from-home stipend to ensure your remote setup is comfortable and well-equipped.

We’re a small team of seasoned Engineers and Designers who love to build. We place an emphasis on building with high craftsmanship, scalability, and a platform first mindset.

As a Senior&#x2F;Staff Product Engineer, you’re expected to lead entire features end-to-end, collaborate closely with design to shape projects or initiatives, and deliver reliable and scalable systems. Rally is fully built with Typescript to make it easy for engineers to work quickly across the stack. While we don’t expect you to have a background in all the tools we use, we do expect strong JavaScript fundamentals and an ability to adopt new technology quickly.
