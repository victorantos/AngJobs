Maritime shipping software - Full stack engineers - Global REMOTE - $90k

We&#x27;re hiring for multiple software engineers to help tackle one of the most important sectors for the global economy: maritime shipping.

Nearly every person is affected by stuff shipping on the seas - whether its energy, ore, or wind turbines, but the industry itself is antiquated and archaic, and hampered by paperwork and bureaucracy.  Our customers are crying out for better solutions.  We&#x27;re looking for people to help us build those solutions.

If you&#x27;re the sort of person who is
 - intellectually curious about new industries
 - wanting talking to and getting close to end users
 - keen to use LLMs and other AI tools
 - proficient in functional programming
 - biased towards shipping software

Then please get in touch.

Our tech stack for new projects is largely typescript&#x2F;vue&#x2F;mysql (we have several fans of fp-ts and EffectT with us and would like some more).  But like the industry at large we also have significant legacy code in javascript.  If you&#x27;re the sort of person who likes refactoring complex projects to make them more workable, then we also want to hear from you.

We hire remotely and globally with offices in Houston, London, Singapore, and Joinville (Brasil).  You should be fluent in English.  The current team is &gt;20 people.

Interested?  You can contact me directly from my profile.  I&#x27;m the CTO.

Please, no recruiters or agencies.
