Gel (ex EdgeDB) - SREs &#x2F; Infrastructure Engineers - Full-time - Remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geldata.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geldata.com&#x2F;</a>

Gel is an open-source data platform built on top of Postgres. Itâ€™s designed to give developers a better end-to-end user experience than traditional SQL databases. We provide a more expressive schema modeling &amp; query language (EdgeQL), and &quot;batteries included&quot; features such as built-in schema migrations and a graphical schema browser, data explorer, and access control&#x2F;auth.

We offer a hosted cloud service for Gel, with the goal of doing developer-friendly cloud hosting &quot;the right way&quot; - we want users to use our hosted service because it&#x27;s great, not because they&#x27;re locked-in by restrictive licensing or cloud-only features.

We are looking for experienced SREs &#x2F; infrastructure &#x2F; devops engineers to help scale out our cloud. Unlike many infrastructure roles, this is not supporting a separate product team - for us, our infrastructure is our product. We are looking for people who care about not just building reliable infrastructure but also exposing that infrastructure to end-users as a seamless product.

Our tech stack is Hashicorp tools (Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault); Postgres; Golang with some Python &amp; Rust; and AWS (with eventual expansion to other cloud platforms). It&#x27;s a requirement that you have strong experience with Golang.

We are a remote-first company, headquartered in San Francisco, with most of the team working in US&#x2F;Canada timezones and a few people in Europe. Unfortunately we are unable to provide any visa&#x2F;immigration sponsorship at this time.

P.S. I (co-founder) personally review all CVs from HN. I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t reply personally to everybody, but we do look and read through everything you send to us. And yes, we did hire a couple of wonderful people through HN and it was a great experience, I&#x27;m grateful.
