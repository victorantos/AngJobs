Shortwave - Onsite in SF - Full-time - shortwave.com

We’re building the [“strong form”](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2ZpJXHiPwtQ&amp;t=498s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2ZpJXHiPwtQ&amp;t=498s</a>) AI agent app for business communications. We’re focusing on email initially, as it’s (1) ubiquitous (2) open and (3) has a diverse set of valuable business data. In the future we plan to expand beyond email to include all essential business communications tools, including Slack, Teams, CRMs, document platforms, project management tools, and so on.

Most people’s experience with AI today involves copy &amp; pasting content back and forth from ChatGPT. Not only is this a terrible UX — it severely limits the transformative potential of AI.

Our goal is to unlock 10x (or greater) productivity gains for the average business user by bringing cutting edge AI together with their business communications in a single app designed for effective human-AI collaboration. With Shortwave, users can give the AI access to *all* of their data and then allow it to *take action* while still maintaining total control over its output.

I previously founded Firebase and sold it to Google. This time we&#x27;re taking it to IPO :)
