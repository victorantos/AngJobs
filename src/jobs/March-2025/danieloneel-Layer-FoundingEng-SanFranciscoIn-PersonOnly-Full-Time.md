Layer - Founding Eng - San Francisco In-Person Only - Full-Time

We believe SMBs are the backbone of American society and small business ownership is the best path to wealth creation and economic mobility for many Americans. We&#x27;re trying to dramatically lower the activation energy in just one of the major hurdles for aspiring small business owners: accounting and bookkeeping.

Our approach is working! We embed directly within an SMB&#x27;s primary business platform, manage all the data syncing &amp; reconciliation for them, and have real humans (with real AI tooling) handling their books. We do this at ~half the cost of existing bookkeeping services and it&#x27;s still profitable for us because we&#x27;re saving so much time with our data access + AI.

Adoption is taking off faster even faster than we hoped and we need to grow the team! We&#x27;re a team of 5 who like working with a high ownership and high throughput collaboration. We have serious technical challenges across scaling systems, data modeling, and building AI-driven automations of tedious tasks.

We want teammates who love learning and want to be involved in company building from the ground up - even if you aren&#x27;t familiar with accounting or our tech stack. We have tier-1 investors, thousands of SMBs on the platform, and revenue has 10x&#x27;d in the last 6 months - it&#x27;s a *very* good time to join us.
