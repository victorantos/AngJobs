SmarterDx - 150-250k+ + equity + benefits - Remote (US only) - Multiple roles - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers</a>

We are a rapid growth health tech company using AI to improve the hospital revenue cycle (finding missing diagnoses, net new revenue and helping clinicians focus on tasks that matter most). The current team is very high functioning (MD + data scientist combos, former ASF board member, Google and Amazon engineers, Stanford LLM researchers, etc.) and initially scaled the company to $1MM+ in contracted revenue without raising capital.

We have been backed by top investors including Floodgate (Lyft, Twitch, Twitter), Transformation Capital, and Bessemer for a total of $71mil, including our $50mil Series B announced in May 2024, and are experiencing an incredible growth trajectory customer and revenue wise with no signs of slowing down! This time last year, we were at 45 employees, and are above 160 as of today!

We are looking for: Data Scientists - ML Engineers - Engineering Managers - Staff and Senior SWEs, Full Stack and Backend focuses - More!

We have PMF, and it&#x27;s time to scale! For more and to apply, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers</a>
