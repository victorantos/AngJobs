Mooncake Labs - Founding Engineers - Full-time - San Francisco (in-person preferred, but optional) - $120k - $200k + equity (0.5% - 2%) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mooncake.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mooncake.dev</a>

Hi! I&#x27;m Pranav, co-founder of Mooncake Labs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mooncake.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mooncake.dev</a>). We&#x27;re building open-source search and analytics systems on obj-store. We just released our first project: pg_mooncake (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Mooncake-Labs&#x2F;pg_mooncake">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Mooncake-Labs&#x2F;pg_mooncake</a>)a Postgres-Native Data Warehouse that&#x27;s top 10 on clickbench (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mooncake.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;clickbench-v0.1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mooncake.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;clickbench-v0.1</a>).

We’re a small and close-knit team based in SF, have been working together for many years, and love building high-performance systems from first principles. You&#x27;ll be an early piece of Mooncake and will be a good fit if:

- Love low-level systems (performance engineering, databases, caching, distributed systems)
- Are excited in the journey of finding PMF. We are still very 0-&gt; 1. There’s a lot of fun that comes with this journey. 
- Are a team player.
