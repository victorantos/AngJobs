Jam.dev - Staff Fullstack Engineer - Typescript&#x2F;React - Remote (+ in person in SF) - Full-time

Dev tools company with 180,000+ users. $15M in funding from Vercel CEO, GitHub CTO, Cloudflare CEO, etc.

We&#x27;re building an AI-powered flight recorder for web apps – so anyone can report issues to engineers in a way that&#x27;s actually debuggable (w&#x2F; console, network, websockets debugger, etc).

Small, senior team – several ex-engineering directors turned ICs (mostly ex-early Cloudflare). Looking for staff-level engineers with experience building highly performant front-end apps.

Stack: React&#x2F;Typescript and MobX (MST) on the frontend, and Node&#x2F;GraphQL across our backend.

As a dev tool, developers at Jam are directly connected and involved with the product. Your usage of the product will directly inform the direction of Jam&#x27;s future.
