Depot - Founding Developer Marketer - Remote (US &#x2F; EU) - Full-time

Depot is a build acceleration platform that makes Docker builds and GitHub Actions faster. We&#x27;ve already helped companies like PostHog, Wistia, Semgrep, and Secoda save thousands of hours in build time every week.

We&#x27;re looking for our first marketing hire to define and execute our go-to-market strategy. If that&#x27;s you, you&#x27;ll own everything from content creation to demand gen, with a focus on developer audiences. We&#x27;re growing rapidly with 500+ paying customers and double-digit monthly growth.

Requirements:

* 5+ years marketing experience with a focus on developer audiences

* Experience with content marketing, SEO, social, and email campaigns

* Comfortable with analytics tools (Google Analytics, ahrefs, PostHog)

* Experience with paid channels (LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.)

* Strong communication skills and ability to work asynchronously

We&#x27;re a small, remote team building developer tools we wish we&#x27;ve had. If you&#x27;re passionate about developer productivity and marketing to technical audiences, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.
