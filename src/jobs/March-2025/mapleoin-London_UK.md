Arenko (energy transition&#x2F;batteries) - London, UK - 2x&#x2F;week in office

We work on industrial&#x2F;grid-scale batteries and other renewable generation: monitoring, managing and trading them on multiple energy markets. Batteries like these: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battery_energy_storage_system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battery_energy_storage_system</a> Everyone starting from the C-suite is passionate about addressing climate change and transitioning to renewable energy!

We&#x27;re a small team of 7 backend engineers atm (other teams have Ops, FE and DS roles). We have paying customers and have been around for a while. Our current goal is to make the platform more scalable and move to new markets. The biggest challenge is understanding how the various energy markets and energy storage in general work and then translating that to reliable working software.

We&#x27;re currently looking for a Senior Backend Engineer (Go) and a Senior Data Scientist. Our office is in London Blackfriars and most engineers come in about 2 days a week, but this is flexible.

Feel free to message me with any questions or apply directly:
