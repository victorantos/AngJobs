We are a small (~35), fast-growing (tripled revenue last year) team building a unified API for HR systems. We are looking to hire an engineering manager to help us manage one of our product squads.

I haven&#x27;t yet finished writing the job spec but I still wanted to put this out there already for the HN hiring thread. You can get a feel for what our engineering culture is like based on the job posting of our Product Engineering position: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;Kombo&#x2F;5446702e-cf0b-4a53-9400-0be2d5bf777e#:~:text=Our%20Engineering%20Culture." rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;Kombo&#x2F;5446702e-cf0b-4a53-9400-0be2d...</a>
