Axle Energy &#x2F;&#x2F; axle.energy &#x2F;&#x2F; Onsite London, UK

We build software to run decarbonized electricity grids.  Our platform controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries, adjusting their usage in line with the needs of the grid.

We control hundreds of thousands of energy assets across the UK, monetizing the demand flexibility we create in electricity markets. We&#x27;re growing rapidly, backed by Accel, and looking for data scientists and engineers looking to make a dent in climate change.
