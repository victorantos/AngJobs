Ingram Technologies (AI R&amp;D lab &#x2F; venture studio) - Brussels, BE - US REMOTE-&gt;ONSITE - careers@ingram.tech

*This is different*.

Ingram is an AI R&amp;D lab operating as a Venture Studio. We are currently looking to support talented US-based founders and engineers looking to build their own career path in Europe, whether on existing products or on fresh new ideas.

You&#x27;re a US-based talented engineer and&#x2F;or founder, and looking to move to Europe for geopolitical reasons? We can help.

You are looking to contribute to Europe&#x27;s fight against Russia? We can help.

Requirements:

- You are based in the US and you want to move to Europe (OK to start remote)

- You stand for Ukraine, and against Russia&#x27;s current politics. You do not support the US government&#x27;s recent moves and want no part in it.

- You are skilled, autonomous and determined. Which skills specifically doesn&#x27;t matter as much.

This is open to non-engineers. For unfit profiles, we will provide alternative recommendations. Add &quot;#HN&quot; in the Subject of your email and send it to careers+hn@ingram.tech (not just careers@) to show you&#x27;ve read this far. 1 week turnaround on initial response.
