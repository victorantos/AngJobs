Alpaca [0] offers brokerage APIs that let you (and your customers) trade various financial instruments all around the world. We&#x27;re currently hiring for two teams: our crypto team and our trading team.

We&#x27;re looking for senior candidates who like shipping. Our hiring philosophy is to bring in the right people, pay them well, and give everyone meaningful work to do.

Alpaca as a whole is about 50 engineers. We&#x27;re primarily golang microservices on top of kubernetes, but we&#x27;ll use whatever tools are best to get the job done and satisfy our customers. To get an idea for the kind of work we do, check out what we shipped in 2024 [1].
