Maven.com - Full stack product engineer - Full-time - Remote (USA, Canada)

Maven is the missing grad school for technology jobs. We have the largest collection of expert-led cohort-based-courses on the topics that matter most for today&#x27;s careers.

Weâ€™re looking for full-stack product engineers to own big parts of our fast growing marketplace, from recommendation systems to data infrastructure to the course experience at the center of it.

The ideal candidate has shipped meaningful features to a real user base and is comfortable with the broad set of concerns that come with building production web apps.

You will have a high degree of ownership over our technical systems, and will be able to shape our product direction and the evolution of your own role.

We are a team of just under 20, have raised $25 million from a16z and First Round, and are growing towards profitability in the coming year and half.

We use React+Nextjs, Python+FastAPI, Postgres+OpenSearch, OpenAI, dbt+Snowflake.
