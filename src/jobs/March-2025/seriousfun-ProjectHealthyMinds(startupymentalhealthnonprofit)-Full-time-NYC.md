Project Healthy Minds (startupy mental health nonprofit) - Full-time - NYC - 5d&#x2F;week in-office

We&#x27;re looking for someone to lead our small-but-growing engineering team at our Hudson Yards office. There are about 10 full-timers in the office, with more members being added to the product and engineering teams this year. I&#x27;m leading product and the search for this role.

This is a unique opportunity â€“ we&#x27;re building a comprehensive dataset of mental health services and outcomes while prioritizing user privacy. As a nonprofit, we have no incentive to monetize user data. Instead, we&#x27;re focused on two things: 1) helping people access care across the full treatment spectrum through our screening process (as developed with our clinical advisory committee), and 2) understanding outcomes by collecting anonymized outcome data to understand what actually works in mental healthcare - something that surprisingly doesn&#x27;t exist yet at scale.

Our goal is to simultaneously solve the discovery problem for people seeking care while building the dataset needed to improve mental healthcare quality and accessibility.
