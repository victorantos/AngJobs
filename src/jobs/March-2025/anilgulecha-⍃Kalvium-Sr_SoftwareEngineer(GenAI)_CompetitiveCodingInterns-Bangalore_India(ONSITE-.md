⍃Kalvium - Sr. Software Engineer (GenAI), Competitive Coding Interns - Bangalore, India (ONSITE - HSR Layout) - Fulltime, Internships (DSA and coding Interns).

Kalvium is the B.Tech CS degree you always wanted. We redo 4000 hours of education, heavily utilizing GenAI to power self-directed education of all courses in undergraduate CS programs. This is the HEROS platform. We&#x27;ve grown from a team of ~30 in 2023 to ~300 today.

We&#x27;re now undertaking HEROS v2, where there&#x27;s a couple of very exciting challenges: How can GenAI be a 1-1 tutor during an hour of education. Can we keep the cost of the hour under 1 INR. Agentic workflows, vector-db&#x2F;RAGs, finetuning and more techniques will be used.Interested in this challenge?

We&#x27;re a team of deep technophiles, who are passionate about the transformation of education happening. We&#x27;re partnered with over 2 dozen universities in India, and expanding overseas this year, growing 4-5X, year on year. And we&#x27;ve done all of this in a bootstrapped, default alive way.

This role would be one-off senior roles, working closely with head of engineer, and the co-founders in exploring and extending the edges of GenAI in education. Please send me an email note via my first name @kalvium.com if this sounds like something you&#x27;d like to take on, with evidence of work you&#x27;ve done with GenAI.
