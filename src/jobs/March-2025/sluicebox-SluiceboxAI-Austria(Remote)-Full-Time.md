We&#x27;re building automation-driven sustainability intelligence for manufacturers. Companies use our platform to navigate compliance, reduce emissions, and drive transparency. We&#x27;re a fast-moving startup where engineers help define solutions, not just build features.

The Role:

- Own &amp; build scalable back-end solutions (APIs, databases, automation).

- Work across the stack—back-end focused, but some front-end when needed.

- Product thinking: Define &amp; solve problems, not just execute tickets.

- Tech: Python (preferred), PostgreSQL, API design, test automation.

- Startup pace—figure out solutions independently.

Who We&#x27;re Looking For:

- Strong back-end experience (Python, databases, automation).

- Comfort with ambiguity—able to operate in a fast-moving startup.

- End-to-end ownership mindset—you&#x27;ll help shape solutions.

- Nice-to-haves: AI&#x2F;ML interest, test automation, scaling experience.

Why Join?

- No red tape—just solving real problems.

- End-to-end ownership—your work directly impacts customers.

- Move fast—engineering drives the company.
