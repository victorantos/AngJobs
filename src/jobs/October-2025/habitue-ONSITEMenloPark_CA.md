Pylon (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pylonlending.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pylonlending.com</a>) - ONSITE Menlo Park, CA

What Stripe did for payments, Pylon is doing for the mortgage industry: We&#x27;re taking a sleepy industry with backward technology and re-building the stack from the ground up. We&#x27;re first-principles thinkers, and our team is small, talented and ambitious.

I&#x27;m hiring generalists who love coding and want to build something beautiful in an industry where technology written in the 90s is the norm. We&#x27;re Series A, well funded, and we have traction with customers. Come to Menlo Park and help us turn the $13 trillion US mortgage industry into a set of APIs.
