Zoca - AI Engineer - Full-time - Bangalore (In-office)

I&#x27;m Shambhav, CTO &amp; co-founder at Zoca. I&#x27;m building a team to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible with AI.

So far, we&#x27;ve built a platform from Bangalore that has outperformed every competitor in our space — small businesses happily pay us 10x our competitors&#x27; price because our agents actually work. These agents work like real business partners, generate leads, do followups, book appointments, manage reviews and more. We&#x27;re already powering growth for over a thousand businesses.

In the next 12 months, we&#x27;re going to scale this to tens of thousands, while making the agents smarter, more reliable, and capable of things people think aren&#x27;t possible today. We&#x27;ll be working on technical challenges like multi-channel conversations, browser automation at scale, retrieval pipelines, and real-time monitoring&#x2F;eval loops.

I need AI Engineers who want to build like founders — not paper over things in a research repo, but ship production systems that touch real users. Strong TS&#x2F;Python skills, a builder&#x27;s mindset, and a track record of actually building (agents, GSoC projects, or similar) is what I&#x27;m looking for.

If this excites you, send me an email at shambhav@zoca.com with your working demos or GitHub profile. Show me what you&#x27;ve hacked on.
