Rectangle - On-site Chicago, or US remote in SF and NY - Full-Time - Salary + Equity

We&#x27;re looking to hire a dedicated full-stack engineer at Rectangle.

If you are (or know!) someone who has thought deeply about distributed coordination, have strong opinions on conflict resolution, or get excited about building systems that are resilient to crazy amounts of chaos, I&#x27;d love to talk to you!

Over the last few months we’ve been investing heavily in building our internal infrastructure to power automation, integration, and visibility across the supply chain. We’re rapidly onboarding new customers and are looking for an engineer who’s excited to build alongside them.

You’ll be working directly with customers, solving real-world problems, and scaling the solutions you build. The products you own end-to-end will coordinate billions of dollars of freight, and unlock real revenue and efficiency for leading tech-enabled logistics companies.

This is a great opportunity for someone who loves to operate 0 → 1 while also being directly involved in shaping our platform strategy as we keep stacking investments we’ve made into our infra layer.

Stack: Typescript, Go, Kafka, SQL, AWS
