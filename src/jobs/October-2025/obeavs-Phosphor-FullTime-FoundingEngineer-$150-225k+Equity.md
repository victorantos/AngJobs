Phosphor - NYC&#x2F;Remote - Full Time - Founding Engineer - $150-225k + Equity

Phosphor builds recursively self-improving systems (via malleable software and natural language interfaces) to enable the efficient development and financing of the physical world (infrastructure, energy, real estate).

Our product is built around a powerful object model which combines document editors with proprietary programming languages for financial modeling, computable contracts, etc, in order to build one of the more unique RLHF feedback loops that we&#x27;ve seen to date.

A primary technical bet is that if we can productize version control properly, we can capture annotated &quot;diffs&quot; of user information with user-validated annotations. By doing so, we create path-dependence, which enables us to specify system-level goals for agents to solve for.

Our product is similar a combination of Linear and Wolfram, with components and objects that enable advanced financial modeling, legal&#x2F;regulatory analysis, and geospatial analysis of infrastructure development opportunities.

We&#x27;re venture-backed by one of the best deeptech funds in the market and are hiring for roles spanning product engineers, CRDT wizards, and compiler&#x2F;calculation engine leads.
