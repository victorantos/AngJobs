Stardrift (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardrift.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stardrift.ai</a>) - Founding Engineer - Onsite - SF - Full time

Hi HN - I&#x27;m the founder of Stardrift, and we&#x27;re looking for a founding engineer to join our team of 3-4. (Fun fact: I got my first coding job through &#x27;Who is hiring?&#x27;, almost 12 years ago!)

We are building a world-class travel search experience. In the future, you won’t book travel by opening ten tabs in Google Flights; you’ll book through a personalized AI assistant that understands everything about you and automatically arranges your trip for you.

You&#x27;ll tackle everything from optimizing LLM performance and building evals to integrating APIs like Amadeus and Duffel. We care about moving fast *and* writing high-quality code; your job will be to take customer feedback and improve our product, working shoulder-to-shoulder with me &amp; the rest of the founding team.
