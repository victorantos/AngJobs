I’m open to opportunities as either a Cybersecurity Project Manager or an IAM Business Analyst.

As a Cybersecurity Project Manager, I’ve led cyber projects end-to-end across planning, stakeholder management and delivery, drawing on my Big 4 consulting background and experience running complex enterprise initiatives.

As a Business Analyst, I specialise in SailPoint IdentityNow integrations, including application onboarding, RBAC development and aligning access models with business needs.

For either position, I’m seeking a remote full-time or contract role where I can add value in either capacity. Looking forward to connecting if my background aligns.
