Allied General - Northern Mexico  - REMOTE (Mexico) with frequent travel or ONSITE - Full time

-

Can you handle projects that seem unsexy and uncool but are actually incredibly gratifying and great businesses? Read on. We’re building software to help small manufacturing firms ($10 - $20MM in revenue) build *things* with higher quality and speed. Help us help small firms compete against the big guys by delivering manufacturing more consistently and with higher quality.

Three pilot customers&#x2F;design partners to start working with, on both sides of the border.

The company is *not* VC backed and probably won’t be for a long time. Good wages, lots of work. Good people. Not a lot of bullshit.

Us: Highly technical founding team with track record of success. Tiny tech team, large manufacturing team.

You: True full-stack. You enjoy shipping *features*, not code. You keep things simple. The role is “founding engineer”: you must be ok with a tiny team and working mostly by yourself.

Stack: Elixir.
