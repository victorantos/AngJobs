Want to work on helping to decarbonize the electric grid and transportation in the US? (the two biggest sectors for impact)

Want to do it at scale? (we control over 1.8 million devices across the US making up over 3 gigawatts of electrical load for utilities that service 1&#x2F;3rd of the entire US population)

EnergyHubâ€™s software makes it easy for millions of smart device owners to partner with their utility and help decarbonize the grid. Our platform lets consumers turn their smart thermostats, electric cars, EV chargers, batteries, and other products into virtual power plants that keep the grid stable and enable higher penetration of solar and wind power.

All roles are remote but if you like offices we have them in Brooklyn, NY and Burlington, VT.
