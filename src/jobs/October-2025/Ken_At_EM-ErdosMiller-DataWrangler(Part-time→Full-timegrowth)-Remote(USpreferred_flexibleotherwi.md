Erdos Miller - Data Wrangler (Part-time → Full-time growth) - Remote (US preferred, flexible otherwise)

We build Measurement While Drilling (MWD) equipment — and we love it. That passion helped us capture the majority of the North American oil &amp; gas market, and now it’s fueling our geothermal innovation, building underground navigation systems for the next generation of clean energy.

We’re now looking for a Data Wrangler to help us make smarter, faster decisions with our data. This role blends data engineering and data science: wrangling quirky file formats, structuring messy datasets, and turning it all into live tools that guide company strategy. Starts part-time with the opportunity to grow into a full-time, career-defining role.
What you’ll do

Partner with the CEO + stakeholders to translate business needs into pipelines, dashboards, and tools.
Build ETL pipelines, write parsers for proprietary formats, and maintain relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Create interactive dashboards&#x2F;apps with Dash, Streamlit, or similar (we avoid Tableau&#x2F;Excel hell).
Deliver insights via live web apps where data isn’t static — it’s explorable.
Tech we use
Python, SQL (PostgreSQL&#x2F;MySQL), S3, modal.com.
Bonus: React&#x2F;web dev experience to shape customer-facing real-time tools.
Why you’ll like it here
You’ll own projects end-to-end, avoid over-engineering (no Kubernetes, no Airflow — just the right tools), and directly influence decisions. As our company and data needs grow, so does your role.
If this sounds fun, email ken@erdosmiller.com with your background and what excites you about wrangling data.
