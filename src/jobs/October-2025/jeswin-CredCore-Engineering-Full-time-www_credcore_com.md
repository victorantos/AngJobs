CredCore - Engineering - Full-time - Remote&#x2F;Onsite - www.credcore.com

CredCore helps companies analyze Credit Agreements using AI. We have two roles open: (1) Engineering Lead, and (2) Front-end Lead&#x2F;Architect. Both positions require 10 years of experience. You should be familiar with design patterns and software architecture, and TypeScript AND Python. We prefer candidates based in the US or Europe for both roles (for time zone reasons), but can consider other locations as well. If based in India, we&#x27;d like you to join our Pune office.

If youâ€™re interested, please email careers@credcore.com. A cover letter is not necessary. But please share your resume and links to your GitHub&#x2F;GitLab&#x2F;StackOverflow&#x2F;other profile, or blog&#x2F;papers, or other portfolio we can review before setting up the interviews.
