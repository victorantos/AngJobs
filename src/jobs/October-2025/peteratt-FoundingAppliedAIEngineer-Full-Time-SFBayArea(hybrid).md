Vibrant (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vibrantpractice.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vibrantpractice.com</a>) - Founding Applied AI Engineer - Full-Time - SF Bay Area (hybrid)

We&#x27;re building Cursor for doctors. At Vibrant, we&#x27;ve picked the expensive, high-touch, data-heavy subspecialties of functional, integrative, and longevity medicine, and we&#x27;ve created AI agents that reduce hours of clinical work to minutes.

We&#x27;re a world-class team of health tech founders, AI builders, and physicians from Meta, Stride Health, and Parsley Health. In just five months, we&#x27;ve built notetaking&#x2F;scribing, Clinical Decision Support, and some of the integrations a clinician needs to run their practice with Vibrant as their AI Operating System.

In words of doctors using our product already in production: &quot;I have goosebumps, this is really incredible. Very accurate.&quot; &quot;Seeing the patient overview AI-generated summary come to life after placing a couple notes is AMAZING. I&#x27;m losing it over here&quot;

Our stack: Typescript, React, NextJS, React Native, Expo, AI SDK, and custom AI agents, RAG, tools, and agentic workflows.

It&#x27;s still early days for us â€“ we&#x27;re looking for folks who ship fast and are curious and resourceful. If that&#x27;s you, shoot me an email at pedro [at] vibrantpractice.com or just book an intro with me: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.vimcal.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;pedro&#x2F;hn-15-minute-chat-with-pedro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.vimcal.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;pedro&#x2F;hn-15-minute-chat-with-pedro</a>
