Parsnip (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parsnip.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parsnip.ai&#x2F;</a>) is an app like &quot;Duolingo for cooking&quot;, powered by an AI-enabled personalized learning platform that works for many domains beyond cooking. Our mission is to build AI that empowers people to be the best version of themselves.

We&#x27;re hiring a UX&#x2F;product designer to work on this AI system, and are looking for someone with strengths in data visualization, interaction design, educational design, and general systems thinking to own a good chunk of the direction of this AI-native product.

Here&#x27;s a bit more about both the consumer app and the AI system, and how to get in touch: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parsnips.notion.site&#x2F;product-designer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parsnips.notion.site&#x2F;product-designer</a>
