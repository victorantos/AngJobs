ReciPal (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recipal.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recipal.com</a>) - Founding Rails&#x2F;Full Stack Software Engineer - REMOTE - Full-Time

We aren&#x27;t actually hiring anyone immediately, but we&#x27;ve hired a handful of great engineers from HN and inevitably will need to hire again. We&#x27;ve found having those conversations and keeping in touch is much better than going through the process from scratch each time, as it fast tracks the process a great deal when the time comes. So reach out if you think you&#x27;re a good fit.

ReciPal is a profitable, growing, bootstrapped, and (have always been a) fully remote company (based in New York) with 6 full-time employees. We make simple software for food businesses - nutrition analysis and labeling, costing, and inventory management. We&#x27;ve been around for almost 15 years now!

You&#x27;d be working directly with me, solo founder, our senior engineers, and marketing and support colleagues, and hopefully take on a growing role over time to treat the business like your own. It&#x27;s a very low key work environment, but independent and plenty of responsibility and ownership for the right person.

Stack includes Rails 8, JavaScript, Postgres, Heroku.
