StorPool - Senior Software Engineer - Storage Core (C&#x2F;Linux) - Remote (UTC-1 to UTC+5) - Full-time - Multiple roles

StorPool is building the future of data storage. Our software runs at the heart of modern clouds, delivering &lt;100Âµs latency, 113M+ IOPS per cluster, and 99.999% availability. We&#x27;re profitable, self-funded, and our customers love us (NPS off the charts).

We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Core Storage team. You&#x27;ll tackle genuinely hard problems: writing custom Linux drivers, optimizing lock-free data structures at nanosecond scale, building fault-tolerant distributed algorithms, and debugging issues that go all the way down to kernel internals. This isn&#x27;t CRUD work - it&#x27;s systems programming at its most challenging.

Competitive salary, meaningful time off, yearly education budget. Our most senior engineers spend their time solving the hardest technical problems hands-on, not in meetings.

If you get excited about shaving microseconds off I&#x2F;O paths and building infrastructure that simply doesn&#x27;t break, we should talk.
