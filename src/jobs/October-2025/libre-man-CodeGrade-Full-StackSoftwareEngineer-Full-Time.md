CodeGrade - Full-Stack Software Engineer - Amsterdam (Hybrid) or Remote (Europe &amp; Asia) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codegrade.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codegrade.com</a>

We&#x27;re building the all-in-one platform for coding education, born from our own frustration as TAs. At CodeGrade, students learn, code (optionally in a browser-based editor with full Jupyter support), and get feedback in one place. We&#x27;re a small, bootstrapped, profitable, and distributed team looking for a full-stack engineer to help us own and build features end-to-end.

You&#x27;ll be working with a high-impact team on interesting challenges in a product used by thousands of students globally.

Our Stack: Python (Flask), TypeScript, Vue.js, AWS.
