ToucanTix - Senior Ruby on Rails Developer - REMOTE (EU&#x2F;US timezones preferred)

Your code will run the gates at zoos and theme parks across Germany and the USA. When families scan tickets, when capacity limits kick in based on visitors and available resources (staff, equipment, facilities), when dynamic pricing adjusts for weather - that&#x27;s our Rails app making real-time decisions for thousands of visitors daily.

We&#x27;re 5 engineers at ToucanTix (sister company Combase has 80+). You&#x27;d have serious ownership and architectural influence from day one.

Technical challenges that actually matter:

Multi-tenant architecture supporting 100+ venues with wildly different business logic. Offline-first POS that syncs flawlessly. Complex pricing rules (weather + season + capacity + customer type) that need to stay performant. Hardware integrations with access control and payment systems.

Stack: Rails 7+ API with GraphQL (graphql-ruby), PostgreSQL doing serious heavy lifting with multi-tenant architecture, Redis for speed-critical stuff, SvelteKit frontend (if you&#x27;re full-stack curious), Google Cloud infrastructure (Cloudtasker, Cloud Storage), RSpec&#x2F;Capybara keeping everything bulletproof

You: 5+ years Rails. Strong at PostgreSQL optimization. Have architected systems for performance and scale. Comfortable owning technical decisions.

Us: Real ownership. No layers of management. Async-first remote culture. Profitable company, not burning VC cash. Your work has physical impact - people literally can&#x27;t enter the attraction if your code breaks.
