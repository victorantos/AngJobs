Kalvium - SDE2&#x2F;Sr. Software Engineer (GenAI) - Bangalore, India (HYBRID)

If you have a CS degree from India, you know the problem: our education system is outdated. We&#x27;ve fixed it. Kalvium is the B.Tech CS degree you always wanted, leveraging GenAI to power a self-directed curriculum. We run in 22+ universities. We&#x27;ve built our company in a bootstrapped, &quot;default alive&quot; way.

Our engineering team is a core group of about 15. We&#x27;re looking for someone to distill and implement insights from the finest pedagogy experts.

You&#x27;ll thrive here if you are a high-ownership individual ready to grow at full speed, value learning above other factors, and want the fastest path to growth (We have a two-quarter promotion policy), you are fully committed to transforming higher education (missionary, not mercenary).

Work Mode: Hybrid - Bangalore. 9 AM to 6 PM, 6 days a week. Product&#x2F;engineering is in the office Wednesdays and Saturdays.

Pay: SDE2: ₹14L (Base + bonus), SDE3: ₹19L (Base + bonus), ESOPs based on interview and experience.

Experience: SDE2: 1.5–3 years (launched and maintained 1 product end to end), SDE3: 3+ years (launched&#x2F;maintained multiple products). Beyond these - reach out anyway, and we can see if any other role fits.

Tech Stack: Broadly GCP&#x2F;Node.js&#x2F;Next.js&#x2F;React.

Contact: Send an email to my first name @kalvium.com if you&#x27;d like to take on this mission.
