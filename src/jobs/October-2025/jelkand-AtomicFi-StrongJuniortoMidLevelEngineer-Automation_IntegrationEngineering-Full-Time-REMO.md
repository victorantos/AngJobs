Atomic Fi - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomic.financial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomic.financial</a> - Strong Junior to Mid Level Engineer - Automation, Integration Engineering - Full-Time - REMOTE (US)

Atomic builds tools that help users do common financial tasks like changing their direct deposit when they open a new bank account, changing their payment on file when they open a new credit card, or tracking and automatically cancelling their subscriptions.

Our Automation Engineers build integrations using tools like Puppeteer or by consuming third party APIs to automate those tasks. Knowledge of web fundamentals is a must, but we often find SDET experience translates well so this can be a great opportunity for someone looking to change lanes in the software field.
