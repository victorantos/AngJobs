About Us

Valantor is a full-stack AI + humans platform purpose-built for the BPO industry. We’re tackling the hardest problems in document processing—insurance claims, contracts, invoices, and other unstructured files—where today armies of humans still do the work.

Our proprietary AI technology has been in development for more than six years, and we were among the first beta users of OpenAI in 2021, giving us a head start in applying frontier AI to real-world enterprise problems.

Our leadership team has built and exited multiple companies in BPO and enterprise software, with a track record of selling billions in solutions globally.

We’ve raised significant capital, completed multiple strategic acquisitions, and are already generating tens of millions in revenue. It’s a unique chance to help shape a company that blends startup energy with enterprise scale, backed by veteran operators with deep vertical expertise.
