We&#x27;re reimagining mortgages through blockchain - tokenizing real estate debt to make mortgage investing more transparent, accessible, and liquid. Early-stage, profitable, and moving fast.

THE ROLE:
Build smart contracts in Solidity that power mortgage tokenization, develop Python services&#x2F;APIs connecting blockchain to the real world, and own features end-to-end. You&#x27;ll wear multiple hats - one minute writing a Solidity payment contract, next debugging a Python API, then optimizing Celery tasks. Small team = big impact.

STACK:
- Smart contracts: Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat&#x2F;Foundry
- Backend: Python (Django, DRF), Celery, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL
- Infrastructure: AWS, Docker, EVM-compatible chains
- Integrations: Web3.py

LOOKING FOR:
- 10+ years building products with serious Solidity + Python chops
- Experience developing EVM-compatible smart contracts
- Expert with Django, DRF, Celery
- Strong distributed systems &amp; async programming experience
- Deep understanding of blockchain fundamentals, DeFi, token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
- Bonus: financial services, mortgages, or asset-backed tokens

WHY JOIN:
- Own big pieces of the stack from day one
- Competitive pay + meaningful equity
- Shape the future of real estate finance
- Small, passionate team

LOCATION: Miami, FL - onsite required (South Florida candidates welcome)
