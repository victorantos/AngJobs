SimplePay - Full Stack Kotlin Developer - REMOTE (UTC+0 to UTC+6)

At SimplePay we&#x27;re developing our own low code platform that&#x27;s designed specifically for creating SaaS apps. We&#x27;re building in Kotlin, and targeting Kotlin  on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend. You will work on this low code platform, as well as use it to create our new potfolio of SaaS applications, to complement our existing payroll business that stands at 52,000 customers and growing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplepay.co.za" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplepay.co.za</a>, plus other countries).

If you love Kotlin and can handle complex abstractions, please apply! If you only have Java experience, we will still consider you. Please note that we currently prefer people with 5+ years of experience.
