Smart11 helps soccer players to become more intelligent on the field. We&#x27;re a small team of 3 engineers and are looking for a react native developer to continue development on our mobile app.

Our soccer learning methods rely heavily on video (and a touch of vision AI) to help players learn from their own actions on the field. The app is crucial in that process, and used hundreds of hours a week by clubs and pro players alike. Your work might directly contribute to the improvement of soccer players around the world!
