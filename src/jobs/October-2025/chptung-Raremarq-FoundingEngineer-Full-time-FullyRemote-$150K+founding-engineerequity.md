Raremarq - Founding Engineer - Full-time - Fully Remote - $150K + founding-engineer equity

Raremarq (raremarq.com) is building the Stripe for Auctions — a no-code&#x2F;low-code platform that lets brands, creators, and businesses embed auctions and dynamic pricing directly into their stores. Our auction engine already powers real-time bidding, payments, and fulfillment for tens of thousands of users, helping sellers earn millions. We’re backed by notable investors including LAUNCH (Jason Calacanis) and Blockchain Founders Capital with more to be announced soon. Our founding team is ex-Google and ex-Amazon, and we’ve been founding employees at multiple startups.

We’re hiring a Founding Engineer to join as one of our first hires. You’ll own the evolution of our core API — taking it from an internal product to a public developer platform powering auctions, bidding, payments, and notifications anywhere on the internet. The stack includes TypeScript (Hono, SvelteKit), Convex, Stripe&#x2F;PayPal, and modern developer tooling.

The ideal candidate has 4+ years of software engineering experience, strong API design skills, and familiarity with payments, databases, and full-stack frameworks. This person should be eager to take the vision of “Stripe for Auctions” and make it their own with the goal of building a best-in-class, developer-facing platform that can help millions of businesses. Bonus points for experience building developer platforms and&#x2F;or early-stage startup experience.

We offer competitive salary, founding engineer-level equity, full healthcare, unlimited PTO, and a remote-first culture. Interested? Apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;KnwFTiTigyQnXrzy9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;KnwFTiTigyQnXrzy9</a>
