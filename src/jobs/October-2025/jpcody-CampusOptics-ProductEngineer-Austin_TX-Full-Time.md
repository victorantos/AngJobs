CampusOptics - Product Engineer - Hybrid ~2x&#x2F;wk - Austin, TX - Full-Time

CampusOptics is an environmental health and safety platform for universities. We&#x27;re hitting product market fit, quickly adding customers, and looking to add another product engineer to our engineering team of 5.

Most importantly, you&#x27;re excited to work in a close-knit team to build features without bureaucracy and make a big impact in our Rails&#x2F;Hotwire application. And you&#x27;ll influence a product that makes a material impact on campus safety. The ideal candidate would have UI&#x2F;UX&#x2F;product sensibilities, and we&#x27;re open to all levels of seniortiy.

I&#x27;m a founder, the CTO, and the hiring manager for this role. I got my professional start on &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring March 2011&quot;, so I&#x27;m partial to candidates from here :)
