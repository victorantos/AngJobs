Doc Labs - Founding Full-Stack Engineer - San Francisco - REMOTE (US), San Francisco - Full-time - No Visa sponsorship

Enterprises are drowning in unstructured documents and outdated workflows; we see a massive opportunity to build the next big enterprise automation platform to transform how work gets done, starting with commercial construction.

Join now and be at the ground floor of a pre-seed startup with strong momentum already in place: signed design partners, a clear product north star, and product development underway. You’ll be building alongside a team of ex-Salesforce leaders&#x2F;operators with prior exits and 0→1→Salesforce-scale experience.

What You’ll Do:

- Help architect, build, and ship our core platform.

- Collaborate directly with design partners to validate and iterate quickly.

- Influence product strategy, technical direction and architecture from day one.

Who You Are:

- We’re looking for someone who thrives in ambiguity, moves fast, and thinks boldly.

- You’ve shipped products for 3 years at least and yearn to continue learning everyday growing yourself, the product and the team.

Ideal background includes two or more of the following:

- Data, enterprise SaaS, or startup experience

- Full-stack engineering with equal comfort across both frontend + backend

- AI&#x2F;ML expertise

Tech Stack:

- SvelteKit, Tailwind, DaisyUI, Postgres, and Supabase

- Fast API, Python, Neo4J, LanceDB, Cloud AI providers
