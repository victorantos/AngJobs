Algolia - Software and data engineers - Full-time - Bucharest hybrid

At Algolia, we are expanding our team in Bucharest and have five roles we are actively hiring for!

Algolia was built to help users deliver an intuitive search-as-you-type experience on their websites and mobile apps. We provide a search API used by thousands of customers in more than 100 countries. Billions of search queries are answered every month thanks to the code we push into production every day.

I am personally hiring three roles in my teams and I am looking for engineers with Go experience (or a willingness to learn) to help grow the Usage team and be the founding members of the Events team.

<pre><code>    - Senior Software Engineer, Usage - mostly backend, all in golang, mature product that we continue to grow and evolve
    - Senior Data Engineer, Events - looking for a data engineer with a systems and software mindset, or a software engineer with deep data knowledge and experience
    - Full-stack Software Engineer, Events - we have mostly a backend focus, but do have customer facing front end work (React+Rails) and integrations into other frontend platforms
</code></pre>
My colleagues are also hiring across their teams:

<pre><code>    - Senior UI Software Engineer, Connectors Platform - building Typescript+React UIs for our customers for data ingestion and enrichment
    - Software Engineer, Control - building full stack products for our customers in Typescript, React, Ruby and Golang
</code></pre>
