ELDRICK is building the world’s fastest-growing AI golf club fitter. We recently launched our beta &amp; fittings are growing quickly. We now need an ML Engineer who golfs to fine-tune our existing model for best-in-class fittings. Non-golfers will not be considered.

You’ll:

- Fine-tune and optimize our current ML model for accuracy + trust

- Work with swing&#x2F;ball data (club speed, ball speed, spin, launch, carry)

- Ship improvements fast with the founding team

You have:

- Hands-on ML experience (PyTorch&#x2F;TensorFlow&#x2F;sklearn)

- Proven ability to tune and evaluate models in production

- Startup speed and independence

- A real golf game (handicap required with your application)

Why join:

- Early technical role in a sports&#x2F;AI startup with breakout traction

- Shape the model golfers will rely on to choose their clubs

- Remote-first, US preferred
