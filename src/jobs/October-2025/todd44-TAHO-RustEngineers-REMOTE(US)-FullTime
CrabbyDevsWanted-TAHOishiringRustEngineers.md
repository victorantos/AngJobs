Crabby Devs Wanted - TAHO is hiring Rust Engineers

If you live for low-level performance wins and distributed systems wizardry, you’ll feel at home here.

We’re building the first cloud performance layer — think AI workloads that run 30x faster at 90% lower cost.

At TAHO you’ll: Hack on Rust + WASM to design resilient, high-throughput runtimes. Build low-latency comms (gRPC, libp2p, or your own P2P magic). Ship code that directly bends compute costs and scales across cloud, edge, and HPC.

This isn’t a “maintain legacy” gig — it’s greenfield infra at startup speed with equity, full remote, and the chance to shape a category-defining system.

If optimizing runtimes and squeezing every cycle out of hardware gets you hyped —&gt; we want you.
