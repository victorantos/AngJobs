Flok Health - Engineering (multiple roles) - ONSITE Cambridge UK

Flok builds and runs explainable AI (not LLM-based) physiotherapy clinics for the UK National Health System.

Weâ€™re a real clinical service, built on software solving hard problems across expert systems and real-time video streaming, providing treatment for (chronic) back pain, and soon, other common conditions. Flok is both a &quot;clinic&quot; and a consumer product company, so we can make our patients&#x27; experience as good as possible.
