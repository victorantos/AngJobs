Stealth Vertical AI Startup (a16z Speedrun 006) - Founding AI Engineer - San Francisco - Onsite - $120K + Top Equity

We&#x27;re building the first AI mover in a massive, real-world industry crucial to keeping the modern world running. $100K ARR in 3 months and pre-seed from a16z speedrun.

Team: Not our first rodeo. Michael Holkesvik (me!) was CTO of series B company that raised $65m. Sanjay Dasari (nice guy!) is a 2Ã— founder and scaled his last startup to $250M revenue. We have the best advisory board in the industry, and know how to have fun while building something massive.

Role: Work directly with us, and own full stack features end-to-end. You should be excited for customer site visits where we get the privilege of sharing our tools with expert blue collar workers. Not &quot;forward deployed&quot;, but we need to be belly-to-belly on occasion to learn what&#x27;s working.

You: Sharp and scrappy, excited about overlooked industries. 2-3 years experience, ideally writing code at an early stage startup. You&#x27;re excited about cutting edge voice AI (pipecat, vapi), AI agents (Browserbase, Vercel AI SDK), and multimodal reasoning.
