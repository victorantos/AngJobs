We are a young team, and the creators of the Apertus LLM, the currently leading open-data open-weights AI model.

Join us to work on cutting edge LLM training in the open. We do pretraining, alignment, reasoning, multilinguality and multimodality - all at the intersection of engineering and research.

This is a joint team between ETH Zurich and EPFL in Lausanne, running on the Alps supercomputer (one of the largest public institution GPU cluster).
