Caspian Trade - Product Engineer - Full-Time - SF - meetcaspian.com

We&#x27;re building trade software that actually works.

Our first product is duty drawback. Every year $10B in potential refunds are left unclaimed. Data is unstructured, fragmented and trapped in legacy systems that don&#x27;t talk to each other. We&#x27;re helping companies organize and understand their trade data. Leveraging the wedge product, we intend to quickly grow beyond our initial product.

You&#x27;ll work with a small (5-10), well-funded and experienced team. We have paying customers and are scaling up quickly in an established space. Our engineering culture emphasizes simplicity, autonomy and end-to-end ownership. Node, Typescript, React, PostgresQL
