Strum AI - Founding&#x2F;Lead Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;strum-ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;strum-ai&#x2F;</a>

At Strum, we&#x27;re reimagining technology that powers global supply chain using a fresh AI-first approach. Most supply chains are still stuck with Excel or enterprise tools that take months (and $MM) to adopt. Our mission is to lower that barrier — making it possible for any business, big or small, to access modern forecasting, inventory, and planning solutions in days, not months. We’re on our journey to democratizing supply chain technology. As our first engineer, you’ll be working with the founders (former Supply chain&#x2F;tech directors at Amazon who have built key components of Amazon&#x27;s supply chain) to develop the core product from the grounds up (involves application of LLMs, deep learning, and optimization). If you have mid to senior level experience in software development, have built SaaS applications, understand ML-Engineering, and love building 0-&gt;1 products, we would love to talk to you. Please reach out to us at: careers@strum-ai.com.

Location negotiable.
