Narrative I&#x2F;O - Senior Backend &amp; Frontend Engineer positions - New York, NY - Full-time - REMOTE (4-hour overlap with EST for backend, US &amp; Canada for frontend) - $120k to $200k USD - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrative.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrative.io&#x2F;</a>

Narrative has been building a data collaboration platform designed for simplicity and ease of use since being founded in 2016.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, 
making platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), 
giving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, 
and making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our &quot;Connector Framework&quot;.

We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, 
and a Snowflake-based version running inside the user&#x27;s Snowflake account.

We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. 
While the company&#x27;s headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), 
Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu√©bec), Poland, and Serbia.

In brief, the technologies we use are:

- Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers.

- Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages.

- Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS&#x2F;Kubernetes.
