Common Prefix – Software Engineers &#x2F; Auditors – Greece – Remote – Full-Time

Common Prefix is a science-first blockchain consulting company. Our vision is to make blockchains usable for mainstream users and everyday people – paying at the supermarket, remittances, moving money across borders, saving, investing – and solving the real problems of usability, scalability, and interoperability that come with it. We&#x27;re a 30-person team, half scientists (cryptographer PhDs, post-docs, and professors) from renowned universities, half engineers with long web2 experience. A lot of our field is broken and we&#x27;re trying to make a small contribution in fixing it, by introducing provable security and proper engineering practices across the board.
What we&#x27;re looking for:
Software engineers who can solve problems, are smart, get things done, and enjoy working on the bleeding edge, learning about cryptography, and working from first-principles.
Auditors who can write and read code, especially low-level cryptographic implementation code (zero knowledge verifiers, signature schemes, etc), consensus (PoW, PoS), or smart contracts (everything DeFi).
Tech stack: Doesn&#x27;t matter, we&#x27;ll teach you. But we work mostly with Rust.
Open roles:
* Software Engineer, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonprefix.notion.site&#x2F;sw-folk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonprefix.notion.site&#x2F;sw-folk</a>

We offer:
- $80,000–$160,000 &#x2F; year cash - Local from Athens, Greece, or remote, preferably in Europe - Conference participation in exciting scientific and engineering venues, 2-3 times per year - The opportunity to work and learn from world-class scientists from major universities in the field of blockchains, cryptography, and consensus
