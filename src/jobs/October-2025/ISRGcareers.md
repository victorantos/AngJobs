Our mission at ISRG is to reduce financial, technological, and educational barriers to secure communication over the Internet. We operate three projects (Let’s Encrypt, Prossimo, and Divvi Up) that improve the security and privacy of billions of people using the Internet.

ISRG was founded 12 years ago as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Throughout our history, we’ve grown and diversified our revenue to respond to evolving needs and ambitions within our organization. We operate as a combined comms and fundraising team because we view the two functions as symbiotic. As such, we highly value and deliver strategic, compelling, and effective communications which are the wind in the sails of our successful fundraising.

We are looking for experienced fundraising development professionals to help strengthen and diversify our funding channels. Please share with anyone you know who might be a fit! Thank you!
