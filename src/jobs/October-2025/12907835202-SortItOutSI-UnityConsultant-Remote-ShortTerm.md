Sort It Out SI - Unity Consultant - Remote - Short Term - $50 p&#x2F;h

Dates: October 21st - November 18th.

We&#x27;re looking for an expert in Unity who can help in one or more of the following areas:
- Harmony &#x2F; Melon Loader &#x2F; IL Injection to hook into game code
- Cheat Engine tools for modifying and exporting the games database
- Replacing &#x2F; exporting 3D meshes, textures and animations
- Unpacking &#x2F; repacking AssetBundles&#x2F;Addressables

We make mods for the video game Football Manager which has just been rewritten in Unity after using a proprietary engine for the past 20 years.

We&#x27;re looking for someone (or multiple people) to help explore the game upon release and identity new modding opportunities.

This is short term work and would be most suitable for students, hobbyists or temporarily unemployed looking to pick up a few extra hours work.

It is possible it could extend longer term if the right opportunity is identified however we are primarily a fansite for the game and do not have a history of making permanent hires.

The main duties would be answering basic Unity questions from web developers who have never touched Unity, free exploring the games code and writing very basic documentation and proof of concepts.

We are totally flexible on anything from 5-40 hours per week.
