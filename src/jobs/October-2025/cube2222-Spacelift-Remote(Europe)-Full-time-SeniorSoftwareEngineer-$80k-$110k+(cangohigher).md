Spacelift - Remote (Europe) - Full-time - Senior Software Engineer - $80k-$110k+ (can go higher)

We&#x27;re a VC-funded startup (just recently raised $51M Series C) building an infrastructure orchestrator and collaborative management platform for Infrastructure-as-Code â€“ from OpenTofu, Terraform, Terragrunt, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Kubernetes, to Ansible.

We&#x27;re now hiring for our new product, Spacelift Flows, built for more general DevOps (and related) automation - incident automation and response, self-service, slackbots, AI automations, building MCP servers, etc. We like to call it an &quot;Integrated Automation Environment&quot;.

You can see a demo video of it here[0] with more videos available in the job post. Tech stack is Go + Postgres backend, along with TypeScript + React frontend.

Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don&#x27;t give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. With the product being in it&#x27;s early days, it&#x27;s also a great opportunity to have a large impact!
