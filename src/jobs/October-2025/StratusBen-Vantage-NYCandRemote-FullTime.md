Vantage - Senior&#x2F;Staff Software Engineers - NYC and Remote - Full Time

Vantage is a FinOps &#x2F; Cloud Cost Management platform that helps 15,000+ organizations globally like Block, Rippling, FanDuel, CircleCI, etc manage their infrastructure costs. We are a ruby&#x2F;rails shop and if you love infrastructure, it&#x27;s a very interesting role as our customers are others like you looking to manage their infra spend.

We also have a very significant set of work in progress for AI&#x2F;Agent workflows - basically an agent that can auto-remediate cost related issues on behalf of our customers. We&#x27;re a well funded Series A company and backed by a16z and Scale venture partners. The company is between 50-75 people today and scaling up quickly.

We&#x27;re headquartered in NYC but US-remote friendly (sorry, we can&#x27;t handle international at this time).
