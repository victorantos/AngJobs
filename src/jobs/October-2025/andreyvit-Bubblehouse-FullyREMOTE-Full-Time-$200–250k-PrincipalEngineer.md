Bubblehouse - Fully REMOTE - Full-Time - $200–250k - Principal Engineer

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom loyalty platform, tripling the revenue each year. Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread across the globe. We power loyalty programs for brands like American Girl and Old Spice.

We’re expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers. Companies are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which we intend to keep for years to come.

We run on Golang and use custom data storage on top of local key-value stores, colocating the storage and compute on dedicated hardware servers, and reading data directly from mmap’ed pages of the database. Ever came across HN saying that one can run Twitter on a single machine these days? We’re doing that in production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted), every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

Looking for:

1. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web platform to CPU caches.

2. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and software stacks.

5. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many forms).

6. Great spoken English, and ability to communicate 9am to noon in New York time zone.

We give you a literally fast-paced environment (with features delivered in days) where you need to solve very challenging problems with practical advanced technology, take on entrenched market leaders, and help entrepreneurs across small and large businesses delight their fans.

Send a plain text cover letter to andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com. Help us see how you stand out. Summarize your experience. Link to 1–5 impressive things you’ve built and proud of, link to where we can see some of your code, include your portfolio&#x2F;CV, describe the platforms and stacks you’re an expert in. How did you start programming? What are you most passionate about in technology? What are the most interesting or weird things you’ve done? What are your strongest held professional opinions? Please make your email easy to read, we’ll appreciate that.

(If you have applied before, no need to re-apply, we’ll reach out.)
