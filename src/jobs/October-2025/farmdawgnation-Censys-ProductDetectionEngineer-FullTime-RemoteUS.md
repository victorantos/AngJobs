Censys - Product Detection Engineer - Full Time - Remote US

Hey everyone. I&#x27;m a Principal Engineer at Censys. We are the source for Internet Intelligence. We conduct a full internet survey every day and turn that into actionable data for folks to identify risk, research emerging internet threats, and make the internet a safer place. If you also get a bunch of data breach mailers in your mail box every year, you&#x27;re familiar with the impact of security breaches at tech companies. We&#x27;re trying to put a stop to that by helping companies understand their risk and mitigate it.

HQ is in Ann Arbor, MI, but we&#x27;re all over the US. We&#x27;re looking for a Product Detection Engineer. Organizations around the world depend on Censys to help them identify threats in their infrastructure. This person will be involved in helping fingerprint and identify relevant risks using Censys data so that response teams can close vulnerabilities faster. You&#x27;ll be directly responsible for helping organizations identify issues with their systems quickly and correctly.
