Hardfin - Full-stack engineer - Denver metro, CO or Bay area, CA (REMOTE or ONSITE) - CA&#x2F;CO ONLY - Full-time - 150k-180k salary (DOE)

Hardfin is a B2B software platform for equipment manufacturers that enables them to track their assets and manage projects for their hardware. We are looking to add another fullstack engineer that can wear a bit of a product hat and is comfortable with &quot;figuring it out&quot; as they build.

Short and transparent hiring process, 30 min intro call, 30 min tech screen, 30 min vision&#x2F;product call, 2hr technical test, 45 min culture fit call, offer. No panels, no leet code questions.

Requirements: 5+ YoE, 3+ Go, 1+ Typescript, 6+ months of working with AI assisted IDE&#x2F;tooling. Requirements are not firm, but you will be asked questions about Go and Typescript and it would be difficult to pass the tech screen without the experience.

IMPORTANT:
- You must be located in CA or CO, this isn&#x27;t negotiable; ideally you are in the Oakland&#x2F;SF or Denver area. We do not provide relocation.
- We do not have the ability to process or handle sponsorships at this time (visa&#x27;s of any type) - you must be a citizen, permanent resident, or have work authorization that isn&#x27;t tied to employment (IE refugee status).
