Tufalabs is an independent AI research lab in Zurich, focused on high-impact academic-style AI research and large-scale LLM development. We care about compute (currently, 6× DGX B200, 2× NVL72 GB200 incoming). Our mission is to push the frontier of AI science while open-sourcing results and building the engineering muscle to pre- and post-train cutting-edge language models. The ultimate goal is automating AI research, while keeping in mind AI alignment and safety. The ultimate goal is to make sure AI goes well for humanity.

I am looking for a COO to help scale from ~10 to ~15 people.

Ideally you care about AI research, you are excited about the idea of helping us move faster, you like to keep red-tape low, you are a technical person who can create automated processes, and have experience owning and running operations at a startup.

We are also open to senior researchers, comp negotiable
