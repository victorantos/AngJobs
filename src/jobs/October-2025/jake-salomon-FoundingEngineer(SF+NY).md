Founding Engineer (SF + NY)

We’re growing our engineering teams in San Francisco and New York and are looking for builders who want to help shape both product and technical direction.

Open Roles:

LLM Engineers – experience working with large language models, from training and fine-tuning to production deployment.

Typescript Engineers – strong background with modern web technologies (React, Node.js, etc.) and an interest in scaling systems.

Our teams are collaborative and fast-moving, tackling hard technical problems with real impact. Engineers here work closely across product and design, and have a big voice in how our systems evolve.

If this sounds like the kind of environment you’d thrive in, we’d love to connect -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;jake-salomon-243347133&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;jake-salomon-243347133&#x2F;</a>
