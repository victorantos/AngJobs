Fern Creek Software - Software Developers - US Remote

Fern Creek Software is hiring experienced software engineers to join our fully remote team.

We&#x27;re currently looking for individuals with prior experience in WPF. You don&#x27;t need to be currently working on a WPF application, however we are looking for prior experience and knowledge regarding it.

Our interviewing process is straight forward. Get to know some of our current senior engineers, then a small take home project you&#x27;ll be compensated for. No LeetCode. No whiteboarding.

If you&#x27;re interested email me at anthony.minor@ferncreeksoftware.com
