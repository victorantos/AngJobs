Esperto Medical - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esperto.health" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esperto.health</a> - Los Angeles Area - Hybrid In-office - Senior FPGA&#x2F;Firmware Engineer

We&#x27;re building a medical device that allows us to measure BP continuously, in real time. (We&#x27;re a Caltech spin-out and found some new physics that we want to get to market.)

Desires:

<pre><code>  - Experience with FPGAs &#x2F; FPGA integration
  - Experience with Linux on an embedded system
  - Have dealt with real-time systems
  - Experienced in Rust &#x2F; Python
</code></pre>
.. but honestly, if you can tell me what a GPIO is and how it relates to the userspace I&#x2F;O driver, we&#x27;ll probably get along.

Here&#x27;s the official job listing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esperto.health&#x2F;careers&#x2F;sr_firmware.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esperto.health&#x2F;careers&#x2F;sr_firmware.html</a>
