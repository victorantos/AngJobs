Carebit - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carebit.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carebit.co</a> - Mid-Senior React Product Engineer (+- Ruby&#x2F;Rails) - Remote - Full-Time

Carebit is a design-led healthcare technology company helping hundreds of private doctors across the UK run their practices more effectively and efficiently with our web platform, along with hundreds of thousands of their patients.

You’ll consider yourself to be a mid-senior level React developer with solid technical ability and good communication, but what really sets you apart is your interest in product engineering (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;the-product-minded-engineer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;the-product-minded-engine...</a>). You’re not so interested in pumping out leetcode, but instead you’re looking for a rewarding, creative environment in which to write, prototype, iterate and ship where your work has immediate real-world impact on doctors and patients.

We are a bootstrapped, profitable and fully-remote company with an engineering team of 4, and we intend to keep it that way. Having been remote from day 1, we believe in its benefits.

Requirements:

* Proven ability to take a brief idea from a customer to a designed, shipped and tested feature that wows

* Ability to see the big picture when building a feature (e.g. how it can be made modular or flexible to accommodate changes in future, or where else could it be deployed in the Carebit application)

* A keen eye for UI and UX, colour, simplicity and hierarchy in design

* 3+ years of React development

* Nice to have but not required - experience of React Native, backend experience (we use Rails 7)

Benefits:

* Salary in the range of £70-80k&#x2F;$90-$100k + annual bonus depending on experience and velocity

* Async work (minimal meetings)

* Fully remote within 4 hours of UTC (if UK based, we usually meet up in London every 2-3 months)

* MacBook Pro, ergonomic chair and anything else you need to do your best work

Please reach out to hiring AT carebit DOT co and introduce yourself with examples of products you have worked on - shipped or not!
