Glide - Principal Front-end Engineer - Remote - Full-time

Glide is creating a simpler, faster way for anyone to build custom software for their business, without any technical or design skills. Tens of thousands of non-technical people use Glide to build apps to power their businesses, organizations, personal projects, and more. As customers create apps to visualize, interact with, take action on, and analyze their growing data sets, we must keep this big picture in mind as we improve various levels of our engineering stack.

We&#x27;re looking for a Principal Frontend Engineer to help evolve the Glide product from a single large React-based application to a modern distributed system. We have a large backlog of features and need to establish the next generation of our platform so we can serve our rapidly growing customer base.

The ideal candidate has experience planning, leading, and executing on large architectural efforts and has front-end design opinions forged from real world experience. They are highly productive engineers in their own right, but also level up their team with their technical leadership, clear communication, and mentorship.
