Archipelago AI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archipelago-ai.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archipelago-ai.com&#x2F;</a>) - Back- and front-end engineers - Contract-to-hire but no agencies for now - Part-time possible - Remote

We are dedicated to improving distributed work through better communication tools. More productive, and more conducive to forming the social ties that we associate with face-to-face interaction.

We are hiring back- and front-end engineers to help build our new communication platform.

Back-end: Must know a statically-typed language (ideally similar to Kotlin, which we use), system design, distributed systems, and have experience with a message broker.

Front-end: Must know Typescript, Websockets, modern frameworks (we use Svelte, and Astro), and how to write testable code. Ideal candidates will be versed in UI&#x2F;UX, web- and interaction design.

Kindly send your resume and design portfolio, if you have one, to hiring+hn@[domain]
