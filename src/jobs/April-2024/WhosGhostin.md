METAPOST: I hope this helps candidates. I got this idea from: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39887179">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39887179</a>

Employers: If you get overwhelmed with applications, please post an update or a followup that you are, so that candidates know you&#x27;re not processing applications any longer. Candidates take time to read your post, do research, then apply: if all that effort is never going to be reciprocated, be kind and inform upfront.

Candidates: HANG IN THERE. Also, please help out other candidates and let us know how the company has&#x2F;is treating you.

dang (and HN Mods), a request: I understand making comments about company behavior is against the spirit of &quot;Ask HN: Who is hiring?&quot;, so we want your help. Not only a lot more candidates are applying right now but a lot more are unemployed and have been for months. So they are desperate and companies are taking advantage of and abusing their desperation. Is there a way other candidates can comment on companies that misbehave? Two companies that have been prolific on &quot;Ask HN: Who is hiring?&quot;, posting every month for the last year have been identified where they take every candidate through the whole interview process as an exercise to train their current staff on interviewing with no actual intention of hiring candidates - where should we share this feedback?
