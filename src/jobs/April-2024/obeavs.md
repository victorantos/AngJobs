Hiring: CTO (to take reins from solo, technical founder)

PHOSPHOR (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phosphor.co&#x2F;20x" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phosphor.co&#x2F;20x</a>) has been reverse-engineering ISDA, which financial historians refer to as “the greatest success story in modern economic history” due to ISDA&#x27;s ability to drive standardization into financial contracts which enabled their markets to grow 1200x.

We&#x27;re doing this in the internet age by modeling Github as the center of the open source world. But to build something like Github, we had to build languages, version control, IDEs, and infrastructure for contracts and financial models (the backbones of every asset class in finance) to make them computable and connectable.

I&#x27;ve been building Phosphor for over three years as both CEO and CTO. As we&#x27;ve really honed in on what we&#x27;re doing as a business, how&#x2F;where we innovate, etc, I need someone experienced to take the reins and help me grow this company into the ridiculous opportunity it represents.

You might be a fit if:
- You&#x27;re demonstrably obsessed with HCI and end-user computing
- You’ve lost sleep thinking about knowledge abstraction problems
- You’ve built CRDTs and collaborative applications for fun
- You&#x27;re design-oriented, but as speed is a UX problem, you’ve learned systems languages
- You’re excited by the emergence that occurs when AI is applied against observable systems
- You&#x27;re excited to 
- You’re a polyglot, and maybe frustrated that functional languages aren’t the norm
- You have an expansive model of the world, and the idea of consolidating these skills to create extraordinary real-world impact excites you
- You&#x27;re deeply technical, but have also built capable teams

What you’ll do:
- Build one of the most unique products in finance
- Inherit a three year old, thoughtfully architected, event-driven application with only minor tech debt
- Build a 5-10 person engineering team
- Kick off&#x2F;manage all of the bits and pieces that go into such a ridiculous endeavor

This is a very hard technical problem at every level (low level up through design) which we&#x27;ve made extraordinary progress towards.

We have traction and investment from leaders in clean energy finance (where I built one of the leading solar platforms as first hire), real estate, and more.

To apply, email oliver@phosphor.co with &quot;CTO position&quot; in the title. Include a PDF of your resume, links to LinkedIn&#x2F;GH, and lay some bullets that point to awesome you&#x27;ve done or built before that match the bits and pieces of the &quot;You might be a fit if&quot; section.

Cheers.
