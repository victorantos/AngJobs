Tailwind Labs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;</a>) - Remote (Americas&#x2F;Europe) - Full-time

Weâ€™re hiring a Design Engineer and Staff Software Engineer to work on Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, and related projects full-time.

- Design Engineer ($275k&#x2F;yr): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;design-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;design-engineer</a>

- Staff Software Engineer ($275k&#x2F;yr): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;staff-software-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;staff-software-engineer</a>

We&#x27;re small, independent, and profitable, with a team of just 6 people doing millions in revenue, and growing sustainably every year. You&#x27;d work directly with the founders on open-source software used by millions of people.

If you like the idea of working on a small team that cares about craft and isn&#x27;t trying to achieve VC scale, I think this is a pretty awesome place to do your best work.
