Sidekick Money - Full REMOTE (UK-based only) - Multiple Roles - Full-Time - ~ Â£100k + Stock options - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidekickmoney.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidekickmoney.com</a>

We&#x27;re an early stage fintech startup working to bring elite wealth building and management facilities to a wider audience, that have up until now only been available to the top 0.1%, (think portfolio line of credit, access to alternatives, private equity funds, etc). Last year we were authorised by the FCA and subsequently rolled out the initial product. Since then we&#x27;ve released portfolio line of credit and are working on a couple of new products at the moment. We&#x27;re now beginning to gather customer insights from this initial launch and are evolving the product rapidly. There&#x27;s a ton to be built and we&#x27;re looking for brilliant minds to build it with us.

We have multiple positions available:

<pre><code>  * Backend Engineers (Python, Temporal, DynamoDB, Distributed systems)
  * Product Designers
</code></pre>
We&#x27;re looking for people who are not afraid to jump into a very deep business domain and work in a regulated environment.
Apply at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidekickmoney.homerun.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sidekickmoney.homerun.co&#x2F;</a> and we&#x27;ll be in touch soon.
