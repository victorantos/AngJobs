Sourcegraph - REMOTE - Full-Time - Machine Learning Engineer, Full-stack Engineer, Support Engineer, Developer Advocate, Enterprise Product Manager - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcegraph.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcegraph.com</a>

Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform that makes it easy to read, write, and fix code–even in big, complex codebases.

Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate AI coding assistant, as well as our Code Search product, which helps devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. We’re building software that builds software, and in doing so we’re making devs more productive and preparing for a world where a lot more code gets written. You can read Steve Yegge&#x27;s post on why Cody&#x27;s code context engine differentiates it from the fast-moving field of AI dev tools: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cheating-is-all-you-need" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cheating-is-all-you-need</a>.
