Quatt.io - Amsterdam, Netherlands - Full-time - Hybrid&#x2F;ONSITE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quatt.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quatt.io</a> - climate tech

I&#x27;m head of Software at Quatt, a quickly growing startup&#x2F;scaleup building (hybrid) heatpumps to help fix climate change. Heating and cooling is 50% of all energy used in the EU. Heat pumps save 10 times more CO2 for each Euro spent on them compared to electric cars. We&#x27;re building the most accessible and smartest heatpump on the market. Our product is live, we have thousands of customers, tons of data, and I really like the impact we&#x27;re having. I&#x27;m currently looking for a few roles for my department, as we believe having the best software will allow us to have the best product. Our backend and frontend is Typescript.

<pre><code>  * Cloud engineer, focussed on AWS infra
  * Backend developer (Typescript) senior &#x2F; medior
  * Senior&#x2F;medior QA &#x2F; test engineer
  * Senior app developer (React native)
  * Full-stack developer
</code></pre>
Now is a great time to join, as the software team is still small but growing quickly. These and other vacancies are on our careers page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quatt.io&#x2F;working-at-quatt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quatt.io&#x2F;working-at-quatt</a> Email me directly ( my-hacker-news-username@quatt.io ) for questions or apply via the career page. Unfortunately, at this time, you have to be allowed to work in the EU: we&#x27;re not able to sponsor Visa&#x27;s.
