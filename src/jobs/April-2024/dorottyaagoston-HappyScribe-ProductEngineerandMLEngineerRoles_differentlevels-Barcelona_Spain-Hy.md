Happy Scribe - Product Engineer and ML Engineer Roles, different levels - Barcelona, Spain - Hybrid or 80% On Site (can sponsor VISA)

With a team of just 30 people and no investor funding, we’ve built a transcription and subtitling product used and loved by 300k people monthly. We are 100% bootstrapped and profitable since month 1, and immune from the funding shortages and layoffs that are impacting other companies.

We&#x27;re hiring Product-focused Full Stack Engineers to help us scale our product, and Machine Learning Engineers to take our AI - at the core of our product - to the next level.

In the next year we want to hire 10 engineers; if you don&#x27;t see anything that fits now, get in touch anyway. We want to learn about your career goals so we can reach out in the future.

This might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to solve one of the fundamental AI challenges of this decade.

We offer visa sponsorship and relocation packages.
