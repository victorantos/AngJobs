Offstream - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useoffstream.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useoffstream.com&#x2F;</a> - Denver, CO or remote (US timezones) - Founding full stack software engineer

Offstream&#x27;s mission is to enable gigaton scale carbon removal by building the tools clean tech project developers use to stay compliant and maximize revenue for their operations. We work with clean tech developers globally to simplify the complex web of compliance across IRA tax credit requirements, voluntary carbon market standards, local, state, and federal regulations, and carbon credit buyer purchase demands. The market for low-carbon projects is rapidly growing with $500B+ IRA incentives from the US, purchase commitments made by large corporate buyers, and the growing climate crisis. Offstream enables the launch and scale-up of projects that are critical to net zero.

We are looking for a Full Stack Software Engineer to join our growing engineering team. The ideal candidate would have significant experience with front end development OR backend + infra work, but the role will include working across the entire stack as needed. As our first engineering hire, you will have the opportunity to make a huge impact by building our product from the ground up.
