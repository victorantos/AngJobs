Happy Scribe - Senior&#x2F;Staff Software Engineer - Barcelona, Spain (hybrid&#x2F;onsite) - Full-Time - Visa &amp; Relocation Support

Hi there, Happy Scribe founder here.

At Happy Scribe we think audio &amp; video should be universally accessible. Today’s state of the art is agencies doing everything manually. We want to scale high-quality subtitles &amp; dubbing with a multi-player editing experience that combines sota ai with a global marketplace of proofreaders. Being product-led we have the datasets needed to get there. It’s the Tesla autopilot play in the language service industry. When we succeed, we’ll live in a world where everyone can consume any content in their native language without degrading the experience.

100% bootstrapped and profitable, we have a product used by +400k&#x2F;mo users with high 7-digit revenue. We inhabit a beautiful 4-story designer office in the Gràcia neighbourhood of Barcelona.

We hire only builders and kind people :)

Cheers!
