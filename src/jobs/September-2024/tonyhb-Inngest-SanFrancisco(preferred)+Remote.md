Inngest - San Francisco (preferred) + Remote

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inngest.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inngest.com</a> is a modern queueing&#x2F;durable execution platform that allows all developers to ship fast, reliable code without managing infra, queues, or state. Our users write step functions in their existing codebase, and we handle the backend infra, queueing, scaling, concurrency, throttling, rate limiting, batching, o11y, and tracing for you.

We&#x27;re beginning the hiring process for:

* Infrastructure engineer: an infrastructure engineer to help build and deploy our queueing system, state store, etc. on bare metal, then eventually our own hardware.

You can see the jobs here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inngest">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inngest</a>.

I wrote this last month to get ahead, and the hiring process kicks off tomorrow.  HN is great!
