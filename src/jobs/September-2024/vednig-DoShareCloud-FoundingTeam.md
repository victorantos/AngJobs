DoShare Cloud - Founding Team

We&#x27;re a group of tech nerds working on revolutionizing the personal and business cloud experience. We are in prototype phase, our first builds are rolling out this week, if you have ever thought about how the next gen file experience could be built or that current cloud experience sucks, we are here to get you onboarded.

We are 100% remote, with 5 days work week over discord, right now.

Just shoot us an email with your experience&#x2F;cv and position you&#x27;d like to work on at careers@doshare.me
