Stealth Startup - NYC&#x2F;Remote - Full-time&#x2F;Part-time initially

I&#x27;m looking for a highly technical co-founder that wants to bootstrap a profitable company. My experience is 10+ years of SWE, most recently at FAANG. After that, I co-founded a venture backed startup as CTO.

The areas I am currently prospecting are:

1. AI for Human Resources Vertical SAAS.

The area is ripe for disruption, and I believe that in the coming decade a significant percentage of HR, particularly recruiting, will be automated. I have a few specific ideas I want to run down.

As for more about who I am looking for:

1. You are extremely technical across a number of areas: Front End, Cloud, AWS, Back End, Java, Typescript, Python, streaming, NextJS, agentic workflows.

2. You want to play a non-technical role in the beginning.

Distribution is everything, and so while I am a programmer at heart, I will spend the next few months prospecting the market, and attempting to sell different HR solutions into different vertical markets. I want to make a science out of testing the market, and then quickly execute on the technical product.

If this interests you, reachout!
