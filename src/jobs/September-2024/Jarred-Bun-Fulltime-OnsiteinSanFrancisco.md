Bun is an open-source JavaScript tooling company focused on making programming simpler. Today, Bun is a JavaScript runtime designed to be a faster drop-in replacement for Node.js, along with an incredibly fast npm client, jest-compatible test runner, and JavaScript transpiler, minifier, and bundler.
