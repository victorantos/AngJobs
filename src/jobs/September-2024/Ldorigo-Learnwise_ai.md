Learnwise.ai - Junior-Mid AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;Backend Engineer (fulltime) - REMOTE (~EU timezone if freelance contract OR Spain&#x2F;NL for employee contract) - 2-4.5k EUR&#x2F;month

We build an LLM-based conversational assistant deeply integrated in the Edtech ecosystem. We aim to relieve teachers and admin workers of tedious &quot;easy&quot; questions so they can focus on what&#x27;s important. Moving towards knowledge management and course support.

Early startup, small, tightly knit team (5 engineers, 2 implementation&#x2F;process-focused folks, 1 sales guy, 1 marketing gal, 1 chill product-centered CEO). We&#x27;re slowly scaling and expanding.

Stack (not crucial but you should at least be proficient in python):

- FastAPI python backend - MongoDB - Langsmith (llm evals&#x2F;observability) -  - Next.js (react) frontend - AWS

We&#x27;re a startup. We need a generalist&#x2F;&quot;get things done&quot; mentality, and sufficient drive&#x2F;curiosity to figure things out (and build them&#x2F;fix them) on your own - we don&#x27;t micromanage.

About the position: you&#x27;d start off supporting me with developing the AI aspects of the product - for now, mainly the conversational interface. This isn&#x27;t a purely ML position; for now lots of the work is SWE&#x2F;back-end dev. Projects on the roadmap: building robust testing and observability for LLM performance, experimenting with and improving the RAG pipeline, fine-tuning&#x2F;distillation where relevant to reduce latency&#x2F;costs, working on a voice interface.

Experience requirements: ~masters level education in relevant field (doesn&#x27;t have to be a masters&#x2F;formal education, but you need to convince us you have an equivalent level of experience&#x2F;understanding) &amp; 1y of full-time relevant work experience (can be as student job)

WE&#x27;RE UNFORTUNATELY UNABLE TO SPONSOR VISAS.
