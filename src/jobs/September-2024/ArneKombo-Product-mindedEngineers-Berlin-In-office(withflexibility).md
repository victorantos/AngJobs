<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kombo.dev">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kombo.dev</a> (YC S22) - Product-minded Engineers - Berlin - In-office (with flexibility)

We are a small (~25), fast-growing (we went from $1M -&gt; $2.5M ARR in the last 6-months) team building a unified API for HR systems. Right now, we are struggling to keep up with customer demand and desperately need to add more engineering power.

We are hiring multiple (product-minded) engineers and support&#x2F;solution engineers of all experience levels. Jobs are here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;kombo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;kombo</a>

Feel free to contact me at arne@kombo.dev - I&#x27;m the CTO and leading the hiring process!
