ClickHouse - Senior Software Engineer - Data - Remote (US &#x2F; EU)

I&#x27;m hiring for a Senior Software Engineer to work on our AutoScaling recommendation pipeline.

We are looking for people who have production experience in building data products - think time-series forecasting or even ML models etc. The ability to dig deep into metrics quality, statistics and build simulations as well as explainable algorithms for Auto-Scaling are crucial.

If you happen to be have Data Engineering or Data Infrastructure experience as well, that&#x27;s cherry on top.

You&#x27;ll be working across the stack - the Infrastructure, Kubernetes Operators and innards, Data Pipelines, but most critically, the Recommendation Pipeline. If you&#x27;re into Databases, we also work closely with the Core database team to support the Auto-Scaling needs.

Stack: Go for the Cloud Systems, Python for the Recommendation Services.
