10k Science is an immersive science education platform where we work with leading scientists to visualize their research data (mostly 3D structural) and package it into VR experiences for K-12 &amp; higher ed. Students are guided through the experiences (think &#x27;magic school bus&#x27; but for high school and higher ed) with AI and their learning is summarized for educators on our web-based dashboard.

We&#x27;re looking for a Unity Visualization Engineer (C#, experience with vfx&#x2F;shaders) and Platform Engineer (AWS &amp; serverless experience).

We are a small, growing team and value those with demonstrated ability, great communication skills, and an egoless approach. We are hiring critical positions with a high probability of growth.
