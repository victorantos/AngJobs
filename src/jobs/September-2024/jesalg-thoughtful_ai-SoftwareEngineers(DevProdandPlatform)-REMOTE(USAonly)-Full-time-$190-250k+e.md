thoughtful.ai - Software Engineers (DevProd and Platform) - REMOTE (USA only) - Full-time - $190-250k + early equity

We are a small Health Tech &#x2F; AI automation start-up growing 3x YoY (we just raised our Series A round!) and looking to expand our engineering team.

Our core platform consists of a front-end app, back-end API, SDK, and some DevEx tooling. The tech stack consists of AWS, Typescript, NextJS, React, and Python.

We are looking for individuals with experience working as founding engineers in early-stage startups. The ideal candidate should be excited about learning new things, passionate about DevEx&#x2F;DevProd, and comfortable cutting through ambiguity.

If that sounds exciting to you, apply on our website (we review every submission):
