Purplefish - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purplefish.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purplefish.com&#x2F;careers</a> - Member of Technical Staff - Full-Time - ONSITE - New York, NY, USA - NextJS, Typescript, Python - $175k-$225k + 0.5%-1.5%

Purplefish is transforming the trillion-dollar talent industry with powerful AI agents that will fully automate most hiring processes end-to-end.

We are funded by 8VC, and Adam and I previously worked closely together to launch 145 companies at the venture studio Fractal Software out of a $650 million fund. Before that I was a staff software engineer at Lyft, and Adam was CRO at Wonderkind ($100m+ ARR).  It&#x27;s early days, but we have a deep bench of design partners lined up that we are going to be onboarding starting in the coming weeks.

We&#x27;re building a small and world-class team of technical people in-person in NYC. We&#x27;re working on really cool problems with multimodal AI agents (and some really not cool problems like ATS and HRIS integrations). I&#x27;m trying to build the engineering team that I would want to join, which to me means a high emphasis on agency, purpose, technical excellence, collaboration, learning and velocity.

If that&#x27;s interesting, let&#x27;s talk.
