ParentNet - Full Stack Engineer - Remote - Contract to start, leading to full-time work

ParentNet is a very early-stage startup that aims to provide parents within a school with a communications platform to talk among themselves. The goal is to give parents a tool to find out what&#x27;s going on and to organize themselves. This is by parents, for parents.

ParentNet will likely be a not-for-profit, governed primarily by those who believe in parent&#x27;s rights. Funding is available for this project.

Development has not yet started, which means you&#x27;ll have a role in picking the tools to do the job. You must be familiar with developing database apps in either Java or Python.

You will work closely with the founder (me) to get the app built. I&#x27;m a developer myself, but do not have the hours available to get this done. We&#x27;ll make technical decisions together.

Email me if you agree with the core mission, and you have the hours available to make this happen. Send me a link to your past work and your LinkedIn. chris at ccleve dot com
