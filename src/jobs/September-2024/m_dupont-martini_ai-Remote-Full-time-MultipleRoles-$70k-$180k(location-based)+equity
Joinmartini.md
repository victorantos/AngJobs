martini.ai - Remote - Worldwide (UTCâˆ’05:00) - Full-time - Multiple Roles - $70k - $180k (location-based) + equity
Join martini.ai as we transform the $2 trillion private lending industry. We use cutting-edge AI and deep market insights to provide credit risk estimates for private companies.

We are a small, scrappy team (4 engineers + UX consultants + CTO) with VC funding. The co-founders (CEO and CTO) are repeat entrepreneurs, ex-YC, and ex-Wall Street.

We are looking to bring in people to fill multiple roles.

- Senior Full-Stack Software Developer

- Senior Backend &#x2F; Devops Engineer

- Senior Machine Learning Engineer

- Quantitative Analyst

We need people who are resourceful, independent and curious, who can thrive in a startup environment. But above all we need people who can be generalists; we are a small team and everybody wears multiple hats. So if you&#x27;re a dev who is looking to learn a bit about finance, or a quant who is looking to learn a bit more about software, martini.ai is the place for you. Prior experience in finance is a huge plus.

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, React, Next.js, AWS, Pytorch

Interested applicants should reach out to me, Martin Dupont, at my email: martin (dot) dupont (at) martini.ai
