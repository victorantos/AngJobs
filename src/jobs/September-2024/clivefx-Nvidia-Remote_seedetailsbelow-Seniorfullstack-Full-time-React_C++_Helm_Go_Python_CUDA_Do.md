Nvidia - Remote, see details below - Senior full stack - Full-time - React, C++, Helm, Go, Python, CUDA, Docker, distributed systems.

Nvidia, yeah, Nvidia. You already know.

I am hiring for senior or principal developer technology engineers (DevTechs). At some companies, they are called application engineers. Nvidia has a very high bar of quality for these engineers, as they need to both have deep experience and understanding of software engineering and development, as well as excellent communications skills to work with external devs.

They are distinct from solution architects in that every DevTech is expected to be a seasoned professional engineer. It is a special forces engagement model where we approach high value strategic partners with deeply skilled engineers to accelerate their adoption of our platform.

What you will be doing: Working closely with our strategic partners and internal teams to get the most out of our enterprise platform hardware&#x2F;software stacks. This involves everything from serverless computing to optimizing end-to-end cloud workflows. It helps if you spent a few years grinding out C++. We are specifically looking for people who have front-end experience to help fill team gaps.

Also, if you are not super skilled at cloud infra, but are a steely-eyed computer engineer who has GPU accelerated your cat, feel free to apply to one of the roles as well. We have needs beyond just the cloud stuff.

How to apply: Email me directly at mclive at nvidia dot com, and apply to these roles on our career site:

Location: Nvidia is open to remote work. There are benefits to being near HQ in Santa Clara (nice offices!) and benefits to being in EU (No 7:30am meetings!) I am interested in applications from all geo regions.
