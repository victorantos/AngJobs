What we’re looking for:

• 2+ years of experience in front-end development.
 • Proficiency in Python, JavaScript, and HTML.
 • Experience with Git, GitHub, and Docker.

 • Strong problem-solving skills and a proactive attitude.
 • Comfortable working in a fast-paced, collaborative startup environment.
