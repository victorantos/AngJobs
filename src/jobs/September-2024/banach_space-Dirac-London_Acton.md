Dirac - Software Engineer (£80k) + 0.5% equity, Sales&#x2F;Ops (£60k + bonus) + 0.5% equity- London, Acton - In-person
Run rate: £3m (Aug &#x27;24) up from £1.05m (jul &#x27;23) Backed by patio11 &amp; backedvc, we&#x27;re an exporting startup!

To the software engineer: offering a chance to write code as either our third or fourth engineer (django&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;python), learn to drive a forklift (Hyster J2.0UTT) and wire up label printers (brother-ql 1100c + a new zebra one which I bricked using Chat GPT sending commands directly through).

Experience as a forklift driver or as a software engineer not essential.

Sales&#x2F;Operations: help us open new marketplaces; get stock to whomever you sold it to; also learn to drive a forklift; dealing with compliance, licenses and related issues; map navigation skills and aviation a plus (the last one was a joke, but if you can drive that might be handy).

The roles would ideally start in late September&#x2F;early October, as we are planning on reaching £1m&#x2F;month in December 2024.

Email me ethan@dirac.software if interested.
