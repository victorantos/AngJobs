⍃Kalvium, Bangalore, India (onsite in HSR Layout).

Hi folks, I&#x27;m hiring in the engineering team at Kalvium across SDE2 to Lead levels. We are build the google-maps of education - the only edtech where we bring a focused, standardized, digital approach to CS education.

Here&#x27;s 3 cool things we&#x27;ve done:

1. 100% AI based evaluators in B.Tech CS 4 year program.

2. Launched our full-fledged program in 20+ universities in India, where students are placed from 3rd semester onwards. This year we&#x27;ve had more premium universities signup: SRM, VIT, Christ, etc.

3. Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.

To align you to our approach: we seek out engineers who want to involve with this problem statements. Edtech v1.0 in India does not have a good rep (tell me about it!), but the problem statements remains: higher education system is broken, and not giving students the outcomes they are capable of (Here&#x27;s the outcomes we deliver - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;hire-from-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;hire-from-us&#x2F;</a>).

Our main realization is: we can&#x27;t rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve built and launched in above universities (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;heros&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;heros&#x2F;</a>). We have a 12 year roadmap! it&#x27;s a blue ocean, and we want to build and lead Edtech V2.0.

Note on team&#x2F;compensation: We plan on being a small core team that geeks out on learning and platform-izing it! Our pay is commensurate in the 60-70th percentile of the market, and we add-on meaningful equity. We plan for a 4 year path of growth for every individual in our team. If this sounds like a meaningful challenge and place to build your career, please reach out to me via anil@kalvium.com with your resume.
