Quatt.io - Amsterdam, Netherlands - Full-time - Hybrid&#x2F;ONSITE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quatt.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quatt.io</a> - climate tech

I&#x27;m head of Software at Quatt, a quickly growing scaleup building heatpumps to help fix climate change. Heating and cooling is 50% of all energy used in the EU. Heat pumps save 10 times more CO2 for each Euro spent on them compared to electric cars. We&#x27;re building the most accessible and smartest heatpumps on the market. Our first product is live, the next ones announced, we have thousands of customers, tons of data, and I really like the impact we&#x27;re having. We also just raised €25 million for further expansion. I’m currently looking for a few roles for my department, as we believe having the best software will allow us to have the best product. Our backend and frontend is Typescript.

<pre><code>  * Senior Backend developer (Typescript)
  * Senior QA &#x2F; test engineer
  * Senior app developer (React native)
  * Devops engineer for our fleet of thousands of devices
  * Data Architect (AWS)
</code></pre>
