Intern &#x2F; Junior Developer - 100% Remote

I&#x27;m an individual and not a company&#x2F;startup.  I&#x27;m busy with my regular work and barely have enough time to tackle my personal projects.  I have been experimenting with GenAI especially LLMs, but also a few text2voice, voice2text, text2img, and image2text.   My area and interest of research is an AI augmented OS and AI agents powered by LLMs.  I&#x27;m looking to get some help to clear out my never ending backlog.

You will be working with me to develop lots of little blocks&#x2F;primitives which will be used to build a more complete tool set and running various LLM experiments to push and bend LLM far beyond what most people think is possible.

You need to to be willing to listen and learn.  To have an open mind in trying new things, failing and trying again.  1+ years of experience in python programming or ReactJS frontend development.   Some experience with git and database.   Experience with RESTful API.  Hungry to learn.

This might be for you, if you wish to have fun with LLM&#x2F;AI, wish to be mentored and growing your coding skills.   Build possibly cool stuff.  Flexibility, part time, timezone, if you have other obligations (job, school).

Send me an email showcasing what you have done especially if anything with LLMs, Restful API with python or React app. I&#x27;m happy to checkout github repo or emailed code.   Contact me at segmond(AT)gmail.com
