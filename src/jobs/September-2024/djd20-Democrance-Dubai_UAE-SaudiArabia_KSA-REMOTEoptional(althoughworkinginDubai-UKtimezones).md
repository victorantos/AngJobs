Democrance - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;democrance.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;democrance.com</a> - MULTIPLE ROLES: Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Pyramid hacker, UX&#x2F;UI Product designer - Dubai, UAE - Saudi Arabia , KSA - REMOTE optional (although working in Dubai-UK timezones)

We’re a mature microinsurance SaaS startup, building software to help bridge the gap between insurance companies and those who are not insured or under-insured. High traffic, mobile first + SMS and USSD platform that requires some interesting compliance and security requirements with deployments in countries with variable quality infrastructure.

Stack is Vue.js with mostly django in the back end although pyramid&#x2F;sqlalchemy is being introduced. Plenty of third party api integration. Gitlab, unit tests, and continuous integration are standard.

Our devops stack includes Ansible and Terraform, and we operate across the major cloud providers, as well as a few smaller players! Mature and international dev team with a few PhD’s included.

Our QA Automation stack is built in Selenium in Java, and we&#x27;re exploring Playwright as a complementary technology. Understanding of GIT, CI&#x2F;CD pipelines debugging issues related to them will be key. Experience with TestNG, Maven or Gradle welcome!

As UI&#x2F;UX Product designer we are looking for you to lead the product design and work closely with the front and backend developers to make insurance more accessible and better!

We’re looking for both mature candidates and juniors - industry experience is of course welcome.

Please apply to together@democrance.com by clearly stating the role you want to apply for, your name, current location and visa status, your notice period, salary (Please do not apply again if you already have).
