Graphistry, Louie.AI - Full stack, marketing, data science - REMOTE + Washington DC - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com&#x2F;careers</a>

The Graphistry visual graph AI platform is used by investigation teams around the world - cyber, misinfo, fraud, supply chain, clickstreams, etc. We have been 2-3Xing revenue annually, and while originally funded by Nvidia and Bloomberg, are now fully growing on revenue. We need our first marketer, which is a big ownership opportunity. Seperately, as our DC gov side is especially growing, also on-site data scientists &amp; data eng for cleared mission work at public trust &#x2F; secret &#x2F; top secret.

Louie.AI is our expansion to making investigations even easier via generative AI UX and real-time AI KG (eg, real-time graph RAG). We are already launching with banks, govs, tech co&#x27;s, etc. Complimenting Louie.AI&#x27;s current self-hosted version, we are looking for a fullstack engineer to help drive our SaaS launch&#x27;s multitenancy scaling work. The growth marketing is about the launch of louie.ai as an easier entrypoint into graph for key domains.

We have options both contractor, contract-to-hire, and full time:

- The DC data roles are onsite reporting to leadership at a top enforcement agency, where we are expanding from 1 person to 3. One data engineering &amp; analytics, the other data science &amp; analytics, with emphasis on LLM (llama 3.1 400b), graph, and GPUs for crime analytics. Very mission oriented.

- The growth marketing is global remote, US timezone preferred, with overlap with a team 70% in the Americas (US, Canada, South America) and 30% elsewhere (Norway, ...). Marketing benefits for understanding technical markets (cyber, ...), category creation, and hands-on.

- The fullstack role is also global remote, with US time zones preferred. Initially to tackle vertically &amp; horizontally scaling the SaaS: typed python, redis, docker, react, vector databases, GPU infra, open telemetry, etc. Later, optionally continuing on to ECS&#x2F;k8s, similar to the rest of our gpu infra, or push more on pure fullstack side. Fullstack is interesting here as it&#x27;s similar to notebook-as-a-service and orchestration on the backend, and a highly immersive &amp; interactive analytics environment on the frontend, with GPU &amp; AI services all around.
