MobileOps - Full Stack Software Engineer - Full Time - Remote USA (WA or CA preferred but not required) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobileops.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobileops.co</a>

[ Company Information ]
MobileOps is a bootstrapped and profitable software company that sells SaaS (&quot;MobileOps&quot;) to companies that own fleets of workboats or heavy construction assets. We have a vertically integrated app that serves as a one-stop shop for companies when it comes to asset maintenance, safety&#x2F;compliance, crewing, dispatching, logistics, inventory, and much more.

We&#x27;ve just begun to release new sets of features that focus on logistics for workboat companies that tow barges in the inland rivers of the USA (imagine 100k+ barges being pushed by towboats in rivers that carve through the American heartland, and all the major complexities that comes with tracking barges w&#x2F; cargo, optimizing schedules and tows, and generating invoices based off many movements and types of events).

In addition, we&#x27;ve started to attract attention outside the maritime world, and we&#x27;re excited about new opportunities to bring MobileOps to similar industries.

[ Role ] 
We&#x27;re looking for a highly motivated individual with 5+ years of professional software engineering experience—one who takes ownership of projects, has an eye for great UI&#x2F;UX, and gets quality work completed on time (understanding, at a deep level, perfection v.s. shipping). The role will require collaboration with colleagues and customers to ensure we&#x27;re building the right features and providing value. If you&#x27;re an individual that doesn&#x27;t want to be siloed and desires to engage with customers on Zoom calls (and even occasional onsite visits with other team members) this might be a good role for you.

MobileOps is a remote-first company with team members currently located in Washington and California. Work hours are in the Pacific time zone. Full time = 40 hours a week. We offer benefits (health, vision, dental) and 401(k) matching.

[ Stack ]
MobileOps&#x27; BE is Ruby on Rails and the FE is almost 100% React components. While the frameworks are fairly standard, the problems we need to solve are quite out of the ordinary due to the nature of industry we serve, and there&#x27;s a lot of challenging and unique problems to be solved outside of basic CRUD interfaces.
