Niceboard - Senior Software Engineer - Full-time - Remote (US&#x2F;Europe) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;niceboard.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;niceboard.co</a>

Niceboard is a founder-led, profitable &amp; bootstrapped B2B SaaS startup. We are the preferred job board software for hundreds of organizations (associations&#x2F;non-profits&#x2F;staffing companies etc...) running white-label job boards. We&#x27;ve paid out over $2MM in job post earnings to our customers and helped thousands of candidates find jobs and hundreds of employers hire great talent.

I&#x27;m looking for a scrappy Full Stack Developer to lead product development &amp; help shape the evolution of our product and tech stack. You’ll be joining a bootstrapped startup at a (relatively) early stage and reporting directly to me (the founder &amp; primary engineer&#x2F;designer) This is a no-nonsense, no-red tape, remote-ok position: this job is ideal for someone who likes to move fast and ship, and is looking for true product ownership and a direct impact on customers in a flexible work environment.

If you’re a “swiss army knife” engineer who wants to build a cool product helping connect people to jobs they love in a flexible, remote work environment, join Niceboard!

Tech stack: Hapi.js (Node), Vue.js, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch &#x2F;&#x2F; I favor a minimal approach to tech, with ultra-simple, readable code and not too much tooling &#x2F; bloat

To apply: send an email to fullstackdev[at]niceboard.co with 1) the main reason why you&#x27;re interested in working with me&#x2F;Niceboard 2) one impressive thing you&#x27;ve built and 3) a few examples of code you’ve written. Make sure to mention HN in your application - ideally in the email title!
