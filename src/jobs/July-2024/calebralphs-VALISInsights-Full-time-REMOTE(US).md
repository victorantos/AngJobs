VALIS Insights - Full-time - REMOTE (US)

I&#x27;m the co-founder and CTO of VALIS, a B2B SaaS company delivering software solutions to the metals recycling industry. Our goal is to reduce global carbon emissions through maximizing the recovery of metals through recycling, which requires a fraction of the energy compared to mining and primary metals production. We&#x27;re a seed-stage startup, backed by leading climate-tech VC&#x27;s.

Product-wise, we integrate recycling processes, equipment&#x2F;sensors, production, and procurement&#x2F;sales data to deliver an insights platform that helps metals recovery facilities optimize their processes. We employ a strong, domain-driven design approach to building our product. We&#x27;re looking for execution-focused engineers to join our team and deliver complex features with autonomy.

We&#x27;re currently hiring for two roles:
