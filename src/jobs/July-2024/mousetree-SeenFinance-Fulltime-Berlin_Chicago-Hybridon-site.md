Seen Finance - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seen.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seen.com</a> - Full time - Berlin, Chicago - Hybrid on-site

At Seen, we believe that everyone deserves a fair opportunity to (re)build their credit. We understand how tough it can be to qualify for a credit card when your credit score isn&#x27;t where you want it to be.

Seen is a new fintech company, started in 2023 following the acquisition of Sable (YC S19) by Snap Finance. We&#x27;ve recently launched a credit card in the US for people with less than ideal credit. We plan to offer other novel credit products in the future.

It&#x27;s a great time to join as the team is small (15 engineers) and we&#x27;re growing fast. We&#x27;re a startup but we&#x27;re also lucky to have the financial support and customer base from our parent company.

We&#x27;re hiring for:

* Senior and Staff Software Engineers (Berlin)

* Senior and Staff Data Engineers (Chicago)

Our mobile app, web app, and backends are written in Typescript. Our data stack uses Python and SQL.

If you&#x27;re interested, just email us your resume or LinkedIn page: join-berlin@seen.com (for both Berlin and Chicago roles)
