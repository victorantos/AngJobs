Bruinen - bruinen.co - (Senior) Software Eng - in-person &#x2F; remote San Francisco

Bruinen is working on infrastructure technology for edge environments - we&#x27;re starting with the database. Our database, Delta, is local-first and distributed. Each device (AV, robot, drone, sensor) can continue working without connectivity, and merge it&#x27;s changes (conflict free) whenever it comes back online.

We target use-cases in the harshest environments - where connectivity is expected to drop: battlefields, at sea, in the air, and in the wilderness.

We&#x27;re written completely in rust (though its not a requirement for this position, come learn!).
