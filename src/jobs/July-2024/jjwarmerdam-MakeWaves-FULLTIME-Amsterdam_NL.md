Make Waves - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makewaves.fm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makewaves.fm</a> - Lead developer &amp; Marketing Manager - FULLTIME - ONSITE &#x2F; HYBRID (&gt;= one day in the office a week) - Amsterdam, NL

Make Waves was founded in 2021 by two brothers with a track record in the music and tech industry. We’re building a kinder, more helpful platform for independent artists to release their music and build a following. By providing artists with easy-to-understand tools and insights in a notoriously over-complicated industry, we want to empower DIY artists to control their careers without making concessions.

In the last years we’ve built the platform from the ground up and are now entering a phase where we’re focusing on growth and maturity. We’ve also secured funding for the next three to four years, so we can provide a stable job with great growth potential.

We are actively looking for a lead developer (with a hope you can transition into a CTO role in the near future) and a marketing manager. Unfortunately we can’t offer relocation or visa sponsorship and are only considering candidates that are able to join us in the office weekly.
