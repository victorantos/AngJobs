Sourcegraph is building the code intelligence platform that powers the world&#x27;s best code search and the most popular open-source AI coding plugin.

We aim to automate 99% of the toil of software engineering with great code understanding tools and human-guided AI code generation. The remaining 1% is the creative spark of software development and our mission is to enable every dev to focus on this, rather than the tedium that makes coding inaccessible to 99% of humans. Our core tech includes our code knowledge graph, global search index, frontier LLMs (the best proprietary and open-source models with in-house finetuning), and OpenCtx, an open protocol for technical context. Our customers range from startups to the Fortune 500. Our founders still code.
