Spellbrush - Anime AI researcher, Software Engineer, or Unity Engineer - San Francisco OR Tokyo - Sponsors Visas

Spellbrush (YCW18) builds state-of-the-art AI foundational models for anime and video games.

We probably spends 10x more compute on anime than anyone else in the industry - we think our results over at nijijourney.com speak for themselves.

Looking to both expand our game development team and our AI research and data processing teams.

JAX and TPU experiences are a plus.

Otaku looking for a job in AI are welcome to ping over name of best waifu or husband to jobs@spellbrush.com
