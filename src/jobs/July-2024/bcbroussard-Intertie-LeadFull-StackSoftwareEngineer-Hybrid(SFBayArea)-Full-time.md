Intertie - Lead Full-Stack Software Engineer - Hybrid (SF Bay Area) - Full-time

We&#x27;re a clean tech startup working with solar&#x2F;storage systems, backed by top tier VCs including True Ventures. We&#x27;ve developed an AI driven energy management system along with our own UL certified battery based energy storage systems for commercial properties. We also have ancillary products (EV charging, sales tools, etc) to make building and operating clean energy systems easier. We&#x27;re running a number of live sites, have a good pipeline, and just finished raising our Series A.

We believe great software is the core of great products, especially when working with hardware. We&#x27;re looking for a strong senior full stack software engineer to anchor our software team as we grow.
