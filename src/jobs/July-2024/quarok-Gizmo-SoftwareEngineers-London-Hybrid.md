Gizmo - Software Engineers - London - Hybrid - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmo.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmo.ai</a>

Gizmo is a startup on a mission to make learning so easy and fun that anyone can learn anything. We&#x27;re aiming to help 1 billion people learn by building Duolingo for Anything - a fun gamified way of learning anything!

Weâ€™re an early stage well-funded startup that&#x27;s grown 11X in the last year. We&#x27;re run by a former Google marketer &amp; Amazon machine learning researcher, a former teacher, and a database specialist who became best friends while studying at Cambridge University. You&#x27;d be one of our first hires and an incredibly important part of the team.
