Fractional AI - Founding Engineer - San Francisco - Onsite - Full-time

Who: We&#x27;re Fractional AI -- the dev shop for difficult enterprise applications of genAI.

Looking for: You! Full-stack founding engineers (5+ years of experience, 150k-210k cash, meaningful equity, 99% healthcare premium coverage )

How: apply <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;fractional" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;fractional</a> or reach out to me (ben@ fractional.ai)

Why we may be a great fit:

-High impact AI projects - we work on companies&#x27; hardest problems to get genAI into production (in the same quarter you might build an AI phone agent for one customer and automate a complex workflow for another customer)

-Culture of a startup but substantive problems to solve that impact millions of users

- Curious, humble, banter-y in-person team comprised of multi-time founders

Why we may not be the best fit:

-Excellence isn&#x27;t really really important to you (this is less of a &#x27;move fast and break things&#x27; role, though we respect that ethos!)

-Predictability is important to you - we work across customers, tech stacks, industries etc

-Interacting with customers isn&#x27;t your thing
