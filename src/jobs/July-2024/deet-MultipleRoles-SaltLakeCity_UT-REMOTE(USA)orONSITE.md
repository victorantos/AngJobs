We are an early-stage, well-funded, stealth startup making humans and computers work together more efficiently. Experienced team from Apple AIML, Bose, Amazon, and other great companies.

We&#x27;re hiring for:

- Integrations and server engineer (Go&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;Python connections to data sources, and data syncing) with some devops responsibilities

- Generalist AI&#x2F;ML engineer (writing agent code, RAG, prompt engineering, etc)

We&#x27;re distributed but expect travel for regularly scheduled on-site, in-person work in SLC, with future presence in New York City.
