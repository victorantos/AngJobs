Val Town - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;val.town" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;val.town</a> - Founding DevRel - ONSITE (Brooklyn) - Full-time - $150k &amp; 1% equity

Val Town is the serverless JavaScript platform for side projects and internal tools. In your browser, you can build APIs, websites, crons, and email handlers. Write code, hit save, and your code is deployed.

We&#x27;re hiring a DevRel engineer to inspire and support our community. We&#x27;re looking for someone bursting with creativity, enthusiasm, and is extremely prolific in public. We want someone who loves coding, writing, sharing demos, and getting likes and upvotes. This role would be perfect for someone who thrives making tons and tons of little prototypes, as well as writing docs, guides, and tutorials to bring others along with them.

I&#x27;m Steve (one of the founders) and I&#x27;ve been doing most of the DevRel role myself thus far. I put a lot of time and thought into who we&#x27;re looking for: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;val-town.notion.site&#x2F;DevRel-at-Val-Town-117abe97069449e58df53d7a794ebfac" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;val-town.notion.site&#x2F;DevRel-at-Val-Town-117abe970694...</a>

If that sounds like you, please reach out :)
