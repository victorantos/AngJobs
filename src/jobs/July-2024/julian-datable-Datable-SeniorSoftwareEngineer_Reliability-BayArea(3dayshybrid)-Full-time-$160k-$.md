Datable - Senior Software Engineer, Reliability - Bay Area (3 days hybrid) - Full-time - $160k-$220k + equity

Do you find metrics, logs, and traces fascinating and infuriating in equal measure? We are sick of the limitations and costs of observability, so we’ve decided to do something about it! Datable is a building a streaming data pipeline to help customers manage their observability data.

We are a seed stealth startup based in San Francisco. Our six person team has a lot of experience in this space, and we’re looking for an engineer passionate about reliability to build out our customer platform. Reliability for reliability? Neat! You’ll be working in Terraform, Helm, and NodeJS.

We strongly believe in the strength of Product, Design, and Engineering collaborating together to build better products. You’ll have a lot of autonomy to try new things along the way, and will have a huge impact on building our product.

Our work is heavily based on best practices from OpenTelemetry and years of experience in the observability world. Our stack is primarily Typescript, React, NodeJS, Postgres, and AWS.
