Forklifts and Postgres - export startup backed by patio11 is hiring its second engineer - Full-time - London, Acton - 80k base + 0.5% equity

About us:
Revenue for June 2024 was just over £300,000, an over 5-fold increase on this time last year.

We&#x27;re an export company, investors include patio11, charlie songhurst and Backed VC. Myself (Ethan) and Ruairidh started the company while students at Cambridge in August 2021, and after several pivots have ended up in logistics&#x2F;export, fast growing, and profitable. We&#x27;re chasing down £1m monthly revenue in December 2024, and want someone who loves the idea of shipping code and containers to get us there

About the role:
Our first software engineering hire is joining next monday, and we are looking for one more, to write code on the desk next to me! You&#x27;ll be shipping code to support new sales channels, wiring up label printers, probably eating an unhealthy amount of takeaway as a deliveroo editions is on the same warehouse block as us, and potentially being a backup forklift driver.

We disproportionately value earnestness and willingness to solve messy problems than extensive tech experience. Solving problems in logistics can involve a mix of code writing, data cleaning, and filling out forms. You were warned :)
