Surge AI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;surgehq.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;surgehq.ai</a>) - Software Engineers (full-stack, backend &#x2F; infra) and Strategic Project Lead (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;surgeai.notion.site&#x2F;Strategic-Projects-Lead-Generative-AI-455b7fb94f0d4543a00366d3154da5ec?pvs=74" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;surgeai.notion.site&#x2F;Strategic-Projects-Lead-Generati...</a>) - Full-time - SF or Remote

Our mission at Surge is to build the human infrastructure behind the next wave of AI and LLMs. We’re building a data platform that powers AI teams at OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, and more. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback is the critical technique behind the new generation of AI assistants, and that human feedback comes from us. Our product has been a game-changer for the top AI teams in the world. Here are some examples of our past work:

- Creating the GSM8K dataset: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surgehq.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-built-it-openais-gsm8k-dataset-of-8500-math-problems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surgehq.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-built-it-openais-gsm8k-da...</a>

- Collecting RLHF data for Anthropic&#x27;s Claude: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surgehq.ai&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;anthropic-claude-surgeai-rlhf-platform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surgehq.ai&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;anthropic-claude-surgeai...</a>

You’d be joining a small, rapidly growing team of former engineering and ML leaders from Google, Meta, Twitter, and Airbnb. We work in small groups, ship quickly, and value autonomy and ownership. No previous AI experience is required, if you have the engineering skills you can learn what you need on the job.

We&#x27;re looking for engineers with a few years of experience and you can work out of our office in SF or remotely. Please reach out to us at careers@surgehq.ai with a resume and 2-3 sentences describing your interest. Excited to hear from you!
