NeuroVRD - Remote - FTE&#x2F;PT - USA

NeuroVRD is developing an intraoperative monitoring platform that automatically and continuously monitors the functional integrity of neurovascular structures that are at surgical risk during high-risk surgery, improving surgical outcomes and maintaining the patient&#x27;s quality of life.

Our transformative approach to intraoperative monitoring increases access and availability, improves reliability, and significantly reduces costs.

In the last few years, we&#x27;ve developed a real time automated signal processing platform, and are working with world-class surgeons at Hopkins and Columbia towards clinical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our platform.

We are looking for an ML&#x2F;AI Scientist&#x2F;Engineer to lead our signal and gesture classification efforts. Our interview process is short and to-the-point -- no take-home projects, etc. Let your prior work speak for itself. We&#x27;re looking to hire someone who can start ASAP.

To get started, please email jmeo@neurovrd.com
