Lithos Carbon - Full-Stack Engineer, Data Scientist, and Applied Statistician - Hybrid (SF Bay Area, Seattle) - Full-time

Hey everyone — we&#x27;re a startup that&#x27;s scaling a form of durable carbon dioxide removal called enhanced rock weathering. In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.

Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth&#x27;s geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial &quot;global thermostat&quot; to keep Earth habitable — but it normally takes millennia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.

On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers, data scientists, and applied statisticians to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the &quot;operating system&quot; for enhanced weathering at scale. There&#x27;s a diverse set of challenges spanning interactive geospatial tooling, map and document digitization, laboratory sample management, logistical routing and optimization, and scientific modeling.

We are hiring for Senior-level roles in:

- Full-Stack Engineering

- Data Science

- Applied Statistics

If you have experience of any kind in farming, commercial agriculture, geospatial data &#x2F; GIS, farm management software, building tools for semi-technical power users (think Excel&#x2F;Airtable&#x2F;Google Earth), or working on offline applications, please mention this in your email - we&#x27;d love to hear about it!
