MTA (... trains and buses) - Full-time - NYC - 3x&#x2F;week in office (onsite)

We&#x27;re hiring one product manager and one software engineer.

Our team works on all the (non-ad) screens in the subway, as well as two apps (TrainTime and the MTA app) and our website. We&#x27;re a team of 20, mostly engineers, a few PMs and a designer. We operate like a startup within the MTA and are responsible for all customer-facing digital endpoints.
