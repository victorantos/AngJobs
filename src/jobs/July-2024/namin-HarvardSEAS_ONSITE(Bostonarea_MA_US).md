Harvard SEAS, ONSITE (Boston area, MA, US)

I have one opening in a new project around AI for precision medicine.
One thrust is about combining biomedical knowledge graphs and large language models into a biomedical-fluent core platform.
Another thrust is about UI for data-rich programmable systems.
The opening is for either a research engineer or a postdoc, with different criteria in each case.
The research engineer would be responsible for quarterly demo-driven deliverables.
The postdoc would be expected to develop a research agenda with these applications in mind.
