still-unnamed - Software Engineers, ML Engineers - Remote

We have a proof of concept and just secured $400K in seed funding for our website&#x2F;app that is oriented around interviewing&#x2F;screening using AI&#x2F;video assistants. We still do not have a name yet and you would be joining early enough to get a meaningful amount of equity and $90k-180k depending on what we can all agree on.

Like I said, we have a working proof of concept but far from polished, ideally using the product will be the second step of the interview processes.  While python based, a fair amount of what we have is based around external APIs at this point but you ideally need to have some ability to get working research implementations going as part of the product uses somewhat cutting edge research and our intent is to move more in that direction (e.g. putting research ideas into the product that fit our product vision) as we get further along.

Send an email to me (include something you have worked on that you think is interesting or cutting edge) at seededstartup(at)gmail.com
