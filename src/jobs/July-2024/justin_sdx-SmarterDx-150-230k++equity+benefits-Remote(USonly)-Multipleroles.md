SmarterDx - 150-230k+ + equity + benefits - Remote (US only) - Multiple roles - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers</a>

We are a rapid growth health tech company using AI to improve hospital revenue cycle (making healthcare costs lower and allowing doctors to focus on patient care). The current team is very high functioning (MD + data scientist combos, former ASF board member, Google and Amazon engineers, Stanford LLM researchers, etc.) and initially scaled the company to $1MM+ in contracted revenue without raising capital.

We have been backed by top investors including Floodgate (Lyft, Twitch, Twitter), Transformation Capital, and Bessemer for a total of $71mil, including our $50mil Series B announced in May 2024, and are currently on pace to 20-30X in revenue over a two-year time period.

We are looking for:
Staff and Senior SWE  
- Senior and Non-Senior Data Engineers and Scientists  
- Engineering Managers (SWE + Data)  
- Sales  
- Several more roles

We have PMF, and it&#x27;s time to scale! For more and to apply, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers</a>
