Sumble - sumble.com - Data&#x2F;Engineering + first GTM - Remote-only North-America timezones

Sumble&#x27;s applying language models (both small and large) to build high-quality datasets. Near-term our focus is company-related data that we integrate with customer&#x27;s Salesforce data to make go-to-market operations more efficient. Long-term we want to become the first place you go to find high-quality data that lives outside your organization.

Currently a team of 7 engineers, including Kaggle&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Primer&#x2F;Stack Overflow&#x2F;Meta alumni.

Our tech stack includes Python, FastAPI, React&#x2F;Typescript, GCP (postgres + alloydb + cloud run), regular expressions, and Pytorch&#x2F;Gemma&#x2F;Mistral.

Challenges we face include:

- Transforming noisy datasets + noisy models into high quality data products

- Making expensive analytics computations run efficiently

- Managing the complexity of an increasing number of data sources, models, and operations on top of these

If this excites you, get in touch with us by emailing me at ben at sumble.
