Numeric - Software engineer (4+ YOE) - ONSITE in San Francisco, CA - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numeric.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numeric.io</a>

We&#x27;re building the platform to automate accounting and tackle the underlying data issues which plague accounting and finance departments. Customers like Plaid, Wealthfront, AngelList, Mercury, and more depend on Numeric to automate their work, to collaborate, and to monitor, analyze, and share insights on their financial data. We&#x27;ve raised $10M to date from excellent investors like Founders Fund, Menlo Ventures, and more.

We&#x27;re a product-first company with technical founders and an engineering team whose past experiences include Brex, Segment, Carta, and more. This will be a fit if you&#x27;re excited to understand your users and the domain, as well as to have substantial responsibility and impact. We work in person in our SF &amp; NYC offices, and prioritize speed and ownership (both technical and product ownership). We&#x27;re growing rapidly, we&#x27;re well-funded, and building out our team to continue investing in ambitious product goals.

Product-oriented engineers appreciated, bonus points for startup experience and&#x2F;or full-stack experience with Typescript. &gt;=3 YOE.
