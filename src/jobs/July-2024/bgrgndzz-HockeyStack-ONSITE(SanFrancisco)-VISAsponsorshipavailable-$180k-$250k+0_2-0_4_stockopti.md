HockeyStack - Cracked Backend&#x2F;Infra Engineer - ONSITE (San Francisco) - VISA sponsorship available - $180k-$250k + 0.2-0.4% stock option

HockeyStack is creating a single source of truth and reporting for marketing, sales, and all customer data.

We came out of YC S23, and raised $4.3M from General Catalyst, Madrona, et al.

We went from 0 to millions in ARR in a really short time and are in a DEEPLY URGENT need of really good engineers to help scale infra and backend.

The product collects data from CRM, marketing automation, ad platforms and data warehouses. The data then gets cleaned and transformed into a unified format. Out of the unified data format, customers can create any type of report the want using the UI. We have a dynamic query engine that transforms UI inputs into a query.

Because of the flexibility and how much data we process, keeping integrations up, transforming data accurately, reporting accurately and performantly is a huge technical challenge.

Please email me at bugra @ hockeystack.com if you want to take a crack at some of these problems.

Worth noting that we are fully in-person in a beautiful office near Oracle Park in SF!
