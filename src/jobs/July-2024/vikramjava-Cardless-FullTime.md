At Cardless, we’re building a credit card and loyalty platform that consumer businesses use to engage their customers.

We help businesses bring imaginative card programs to life, and have pioneered technology to embed credit card features natively into their products.

We are in a growth phase right now and there is a lot of interesting product and platform work to be done over the next year. We are a team of 6 engineers so far and are actively hiring experienced senior engineers who can not only provide direction for the next generation of scaling but also get comfortable in getting their hands dirty in improving our technical systems! Our BE stack is predominantly Java running on AWS (K8s, Dynamo).
