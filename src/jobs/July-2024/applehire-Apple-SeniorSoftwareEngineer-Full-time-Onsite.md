- Relational and non-relational database expertise: PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and other databases are your area of specialization. You know how to design and implement efficient data storage and retrieval systems.

- Experience in data migration, disaster recovery, and capacity planning: We&#x27;re talking about large-scale data management here. Your experience in these areas will be invaluable.

Responsibilities:
