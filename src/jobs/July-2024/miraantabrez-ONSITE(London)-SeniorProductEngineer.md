Hypertune (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hypertune.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hypertune.com</a>) - ONSITE (London) - Senior Product Engineer

We&#x27;re building the most flexible and developer-friendly platform for feature flags, A&#x2F;B testing, analytics and app configuration. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hypertune.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hypertune.com</a> for more details.

At the core of Hypertune is a visual, functional, statically-typed programming language with first-class citizens for analytics, A&#x2F;B testing and machine learning loops.

Our UI lets users define their configuration logic in this language and our SDKs act as interpreters, evaluating the logic locally with zero network latency.

As a senior product engineer, you&#x27;ll work mainly in TypeScript and React.

If you&#x27;re interested, please email miraan at hypertune dot com with your LinkedIn, CV or a link to a project you&#x27;ve built!
