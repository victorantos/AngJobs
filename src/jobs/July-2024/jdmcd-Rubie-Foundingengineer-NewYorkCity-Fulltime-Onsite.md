Rubie - Founding engineer - New York City - Full time - Onsite

Rubie is helping companies with complex software (ERPs, CRMs, etc) launch with their customers faster. We do this by automating the highly repetitive manual tasks that professional services and customer success teams perform using novel agentic infrastructure. This results in a massively faster customer implementation  cycle - in the case of one of our partners, 70% faster!

We are hiring founding engineers in person in NYC. The first step in our process is completing our reverse engineering challenge, which is located here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ReverseEngineerThisSite.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ReverseEngineerThisSite.com</a>
