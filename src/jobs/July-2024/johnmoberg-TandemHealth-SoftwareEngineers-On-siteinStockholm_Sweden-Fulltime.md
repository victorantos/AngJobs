Tandem Health - Software Engineers - On-site in Stockholm, Sweden - Full time

At Tandem Health we&#x27;re building a clinician copilot to allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, already at $300k ARR (+35% MoM) with over 50 care providers using the product every day. With our target set at the ginormous European healthcare market.

We’ve recently raised a large seed round and are expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! Our tech stack is mostly Python and TypeScript&#x2F;React running on k8s in Azure.
