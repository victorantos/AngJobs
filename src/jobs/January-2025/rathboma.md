Beekeeper Studio - open source database management app - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beekeeperstudio.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beekeeperstudio.io</a> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;beekeeper-studio&#x2F;beekeeper-studio">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;beekeeper-studio&#x2F;beekeeper-studio</a>

I need remote part&#x2F;full time folks to help with the following:

============

Marketing &#x2F; Growth

Write blog posts, email sequences, landing pages, ads, videos, etc. Must be comfortable with Markdown and HTML&#x2F;CSS.
Goal: Help increase signups &amp; conversions, reduce churn.

============

Support &amp; QA

Test the application, respond to customer requests, help triage GitHub. Write automated tests. Opportunities to do other stuff like coding &#x2F; marketing if interested.
Goal: Help our releases be rock-solid.

============

Location preference: Global! If you&#x27;re in Latin America I can pay well and that&#x27;s perfect for timezone overlap.
