Gain Compliance - Sr Software Engineer - Remote (USA) - Full-time - ~$160k - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.gaincompliance.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.gaincompliance.com</a>

Hey this is Brian from Gain Compliance, we&#x27;ve had success hiring out of a hacker news thread before, so let&#x27;s give it a spin again.

We are a small company that builds financial reporting tools for the insurance industry. While the domain might be foreign to most, we are having a lot of fun building modern web software with React, Python and Node running on GCP infrastructure. You&#x27;ll be joining 7 other engineers split into two full stack product focused teams.

We&#x27;ve been around over 8 years and value empowering our customers to breeze through their boring compliance tasks, building great teams that focus on outcomes over features, and work place stability.

We wrote a lot more over at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.gaincompliance.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.gaincompliance.com</a> if you are interested.
