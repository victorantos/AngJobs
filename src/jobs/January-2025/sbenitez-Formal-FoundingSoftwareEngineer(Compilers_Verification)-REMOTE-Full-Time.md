Formal - Founding Software Engineer (Compilers, Verification) - REMOTE - Full-Time - &gt;= $200k + 0.5% equity

We&#x27;re rethinking the computing stack from the ground up for truly elastic, soundly isolated, instantly and globally available execution. Weâ€™re building OS interfaces and compilers for low overhead, formally verified isolation without containers or VMs. We&#x27;re starting with the network: a programming language to replace eBPF and enable globally programmable networking as a service.

We are a 4-person, VC-funded team with PhDs from Stanford, UW, and OSU, advised by professors from MIT and UWaterloo. We are hiring founding-level software engineers [1] in compilers, programming languages, &amp; verification.

Please email us at (work at formalstack dot com) and let us know how you fit the role [1]. While we are only able to move forward with strictly qualifying applicants at this time, we welcome conversations with anyone interested.
