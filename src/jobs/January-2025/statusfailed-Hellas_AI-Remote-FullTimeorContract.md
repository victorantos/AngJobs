Hellas.AI - Remote - Full Time or Contract - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellas.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellas.ai</a>

Hellas.AI is building a compiler for categorical deep learning to power decentralised, serverless AI.
If you&#x27;re interested in any of the following, get in touch:

* Category Theory and string diagrams

* Compilers and array programming languages

* Deep Learning&#x2F;ML&#x2F;AI and&#x2F;or GPU programming (e.g. CUDA&#x2F;
WGSL)

* Building and deploying distributed systems

* Peer-to-peer software and blockchain

If you have project(s) demonstrating your experience in one or more of these areas, get in touch!

Our process is simple: we read code you&#x27;ve written and research you&#x27;ve published, then interview you about it.
We don&#x27;t do tedious coding tests.

Some experience of Rust or a functional language (Haskell, OCaml, any Lisp) is preferred.
