Prophet Town LLC - Platform Engineer and Full-Stack Engineer - USA-ONLY REMOTE - Full-time - $220K-$350K annual total comp (multiple) - English fluency required

I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a small, worker-first, fully-remote, SF-based, boutique indie tech agency. Our leadership staff are ex-Fortune 100; everybody codes. Notable recent projects: voltagepark.com and a Slackbot for Anduril’s employees.

This month, we’re hiring two types of technical staff: platform engineers, and software engineers.  We are currently filling “Tier 3” (5-10 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e, $220K-$300K annual comp) and “Tier 4” (7-20 y&#x2F;o&#x2F;e, $280K-$350K annual total comp) roles.

*Platform Engineers* (devops&#x2F;SRE specialist, but with full stack application engineering experience):

<pre><code>  * Mostly AWS, some GCP; Kubernetes, Docker; Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation; ArgoCD, Kargo; Datadog, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki.

  * React; Typescript, Python, Ruby on Rails; NodeJS, NextJS, Vercel.
</code></pre>
*Software Engineers*:

<pre><code>  * JS&#x2F;TS heavy (SQL&#x2F;NextJS&#x2F;Node&#x2F;React, React+ReactNative), gen-ai nice-to-have, AWS deployments.
</code></pre>
Culturally, we look for self-driven individuals, who exhibit high integrity, who are able to articulate their aspirations, and who pursue “everybody wins” business.
