Graphistry powers data-intensive investigations for enterprises, governments, NGOs, and tech companies around the world. Teams use Graphistry to investigate important problems like cyber incidents, misinformation, supply chains, and clickstreams. A Gartner Cool Vendor, we pioneered GPU cloud &lt;&gt; GPU client computing for visual graph AI and helped start what became Apache Arrow and Nvidia RAPIDS (GPU dataframes). We spun out of US Berkeley and are profitably growing year-over-year.

Louie.AI is our new genAI-native analytics tier that builds on the Graphistry mission and capabilities. The analyst-facing portion is genAI-native notebooks, dashboards, and APIs for interactively working with data much more easily. On the backend, we&#x27;re building AI-automated investigation support for problems like large-scale continuous monitoring of emergencies.

We are hiring in two research roles:

- Generally lead people, mission, and practice as we grow a formal R&amp;D subdivision
