C++ Software Developers - Full-Time, Hybrid (Germany, Poland, Lithuania) or Remote (EU)

The ideal candidate has experience with modern C++ and with R&amp;D projects. It would be nice if you known any of the following technologies: Modern C++, cross-platform development (arm&#x2F;x86, Windows&#x2F;Macos&#x2F;Linux and its system APIs), code optimization, debuging (gdb, lldb, windbg, wireshark), testing (gTest, gMock) and profiling tools (perf, Instruments, etc). Efficient use of shared memory, pipes, and other IPC resources. Familiarity with GUI frameworks or custom UI toolkit design is helpful.
