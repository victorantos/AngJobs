Krea - Engineering and Research Staff - Full-time - San Francisco, CA in Person - 75th percentile market rate on both salary and equity (at least)

Hi, I’m Diego Rodriguez, cofounder and CTO of Krea. We are building a set of creative tools to enable designers and artists to use AI for multimedia: make images, make videos, … we also want to help them create across other modalities like 3D or sound. We are looking for people across a wide spectrum of software engineering and AI research roles: web development, database administration, cluster management, site reliability, iOS development, ML infrastructure engineering, ML researcher (e.g. multimodal research applied to controllability of diffusion models), API development, security engineers… just apply if you find us interesting!

Top-tier venture firms have backed us—as well as extraordinary individuals across AI research and engineering (e.g. founding member of OpenAI, cofounder of Facebook AI Research now knows as Meta AI, or the ex-president of Disney).

Our team is extremely small (8 at the time of writing) but we’re growing fast. We’ll be 12 in a few weeks and our usage and revenue is growing too. You’ll be at an environmental with a lot of freedom and notable for its lack of BS. We still don’t use Slack for internal communication!

The set of challenges we’ll face this year range from graphics optimizations around performance (both on Web and iOS) as well as scaling our CPU+GPU infrastructure. For instance, serving millions of concurrent creative professionals or building the infrastructure of our newly formed AI research lab (greenfield project!).

If you want more details of any kind, please apply to d+hn@krea.ai (include the “hn” to be prioritized). Make the email self-contained; no need for resume &#x2F; the mail is the resume.
