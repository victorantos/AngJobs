IBM - Hybrid in Cambridge, MA (Boston metro area) - Full Time - Research Engineer

The MIT-IBM Watson AI lab is hiring a Research Engineer.

Information on base salary ranges etc. can be found at the posting: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibmglobal.avature.net&#x2F;en_US&#x2F;careers&#x2F;JobDetail?jobId=6281&amp;source=WEB_Search_NA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibmglobal.avature.net&#x2F;en_US&#x2F;careers&#x2F;JobDetail?jobId=...</a>

If you&#x27;ve been hacking on&#x2F;with LLMs, please apply! The job posting casts a wide net, so please don&#x27;t self-disqualify if you only check some of our boxes. Prior research experience is great but we&#x27;re more interested in cool things you&#x27;ve built than in pdfs you&#x27;ve pushed through academic gauntlets :-)
