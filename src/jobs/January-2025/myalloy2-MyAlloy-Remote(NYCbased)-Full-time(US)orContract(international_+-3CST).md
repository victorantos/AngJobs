MyAlloy - Remote (NYC based) - Full-time (US) or Contract (international, +-3 CST)

MyAlloy is on a mission to revolutionize menopause healthcare for women over 40. Recognizing the lack of effective solutions for the 47 million women entering menopause annually, MyAlloy provides evidence-based solutions and expertise to help women feel fantastic during this phase of life.

Our small, in-house development team builds and maintains a marketing site, customer portal, internal apps, and backend systems to connect to our doctor portal, payment systems, and pharmacy fulfillment. You&#x27;ll receive quite a lot of ownership, but we&#x27;ll support you every step of the way.

* Mid to Senior Operational Support Engineer (2+ years experience) $110k-$140k

Working from within our Engineering team, you will be a champion for the tools and processes that drive the success of our technical and non-technical internal users. This includes:

- Managing and expanding tools built for our internal teams.

- Understanding, resolving, and automating away manual intervention tasks

- Identifying, triaging, and resolving bugs

- Bringing our alerting and monitoring strategies to the next level

We are excited to hear from &quot;career-switchers&quot; with substantial coding experience as well as reliability engineers, dev ops, and product developers with traditional experience on engineering teams.

* &quot;Hands On&quot; Front End Engineering Manager (6+ years experience) $150k-$190k

We are looking for a software engineer with significant experience in leading teams as well as building, deploying, and supporting substantial, live applications. In coordination with our Lead Front End Engineer, you will lead a team of talented developers in developing MyAlloy&#x27;s Front End offerings. Some upcoming projects in 2025 include:

- Deeply integrating CMS tooling to allow internal teams dynamic, self-service authoring capabilities

- Design, implement, and release a mobile app

- Audit and improve site performance metrics (SEO, Accessibility, etc.)

The ideal candidate is someone ready to lead through example, and so we&#x27;re excited to talk to folks ready to roll up their sleeves and dive into our codebase.

Tech: Typescript monorepo, React, Next.js, Node, Retool, Metabase, Postgres
