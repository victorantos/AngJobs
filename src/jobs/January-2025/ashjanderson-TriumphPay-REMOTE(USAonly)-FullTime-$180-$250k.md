TriumphPay - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;triumphpay.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;triumphpay.com</a> - Senior&#x2F;Lead Engineers - REMOTE (USA only) - Full Time - $180-$250k

At TriumphPay, we are building the transportation payments network for the future. With our payments and audit products, we touch over $50 billion in unique brokered freight transactions across the United States. Our customers use our products to solve real world problems and operate in our software all day every day. This is both exciting and also an incredible responsibility.

We are looking for experienced full-stack engineers to join our team of 50+ engineers. You will work closely in a team of 3-5 people on a specific project. Inside this team, you will manage your own backlog and schedule. We rotate teams and work areas quarterly to give you a breadth of experience. We are a fully remote engineering organization that believes strongly in work life balance and strong boundaries. We care about our environment because we know that we do our best work when we are happy and feel valued.

Tech stack we&#x27;re looking to fill: Rails (+Sorbet) &amp; Elm. Any background is welcome though, as long as you&#x27;re willing to learn.

Happy to answer any questions here or via email (aanderson@&lt;companydomain&gt;)
