<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;center.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;center.app</a> - Center Pixel, Inc - Engineering - Full-time - Palo Alto, CA &amp; Remote - 100k+ and up (we are flexible on salary since we&#x27;re venture-backed and still a very small team)

We build web3 developer tools and are most focused on solving the &quot;schlep&quot; types of problems that every team ends up building in house but shouldn&#x27;t have to.

We started about 3 years ago and have finally started to find product market fit. I&#x27;m looking to scale the engineering team so that I can focus more on growing the business.
