Streak - Remote Only - Staff UI Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;staff-ui-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;staff-ui-engineer</a>

Streak (www.streak.com) is a CRM built on Gmail. We’re a remote-first team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.

We want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features &#x2F; frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers#benefits" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers#benefits</a>). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.

Lastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.
