Dirac - Founding Software Engineer - 2% equity + £100,000 base - VC+patio11-backed startup looking to build the Walmart for import-export - London - In-Person

Happy New Year! We&#x27;re looking to hire our first Senior &#x2F; Lead SWE. We&#x27;re growing ~3x YoY and doing &gt;£0.5m revenue per month

You&#x27;ll be helping build the software backend for the Walmart of import-export. That means integrations for new marketplaces and suppliers, accountancy, pricing and order optimisation, logistics etc. You&#x27;ll be reporting to the co-founder&#x2F;ceo but also reviewing his code &lt;&#x27;the most disorganised code I have seen in my entire life&#x27; said one person in a code review, apologies!!!&gt; :)

What we do: we buy stock in one country and sell it to customers in a different country. Stock purchasing and logistics is handled by an internal backend which you will be helping to write!

About you: &gt;2σ on ambition, &gt;2.5σ technically. Formidable with some business sense. Wants to drive a forklift (our office and warehouse are on the same site).
