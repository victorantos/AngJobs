Tram Case - Multiple Engineering Roles - LatAm Remote - Full-time
We&#x27;re building AI-powered tools that make legal work smoother, smarter, and more accessible. As a well-funded stealth company with usage at scale, we&#x27;re looking to expand our foundational team to take it to the next level.

We&#x27;re solving hard problems at scale using AI, building solutions that literally change people&#x27;s lives (our first product helps an immigration law firm help their clients of domestic violence and humanitarian crisis survivors find steady footing).

Our engineering team uses best-in-class tools and practices learned from top Silicon Valley teams - we don&#x27;t take shortcuts with quality. As a LatAm-based product and team, we&#x27;re looking for talented engineers across Latin America to join us in shaping the future of legal tech.
