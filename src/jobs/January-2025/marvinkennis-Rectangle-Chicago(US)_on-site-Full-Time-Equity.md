Rectangle - Chicago (US), on-site - Full-Time - Equity

We&#x27;re looking to hire a dedicated backend engineer at Rectangle. We&#x27;re looking to solve the communication and collaboration problems in the global supply chain.

If you are (or know!) someone who has thought deeply about distributed coordination, have strong opinions on conflict resolution, or get excited about building systems that are resilient to crazy amounts of chaos, I&#x27;d love to talk to you!

Over the past ~6 months my co-founder and I have been hard at work building our product, soon helping coordinate billions of dollars worth of shipments. Our customers love what we&#x27;ve been building for them, we&#x27;ve got revenue, and are backed by leading VCs in the industry.

If you&#x27;re interested in solving some of the most challenging problems at the intersection of technology and logistics, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out.
