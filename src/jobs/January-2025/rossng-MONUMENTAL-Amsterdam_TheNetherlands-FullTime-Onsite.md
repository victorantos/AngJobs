MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite

We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.

We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a software stack that lets us prototype on the fly. Right now, we have multiple robots deployed on real construction sites and have started making revenue from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.

The full team is now about 45 people (and still growing fast!) There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building and we need talented people to meet it.

Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.

Late last year we started hiring for a new role: Forward Deployed Robotics Engineer (also open to interns). We are looking for people can bridge the gap between software engineering and the construction site: operating the robot; spotting opportunities to build faster and better; and rapidly hacking them into existence.

My colleague has written a blog post[1] about his experience in this role - give it a read if you&#x27;re interested.

Other open roles:

- Software Engineer, Controls

- Software Engineer, Machine Vision

- Assembly&#x2F;manufacturing technicians and robot operators

P.S. We&#x27;re always on the lookout for very strong generalist engineers who can operate at any layer of the stack (firmware, networking, UI, application code - whatever&#x27;s needed!)
