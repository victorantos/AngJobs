GovPro AI &#x2F; Unanet - REMOTE (US) - Full-Time - Software Engineer (AI)

We&#x27;re using AI to automate the procurement cycle for the US government. We mainly work with contractors to speed up the search, research &amp; proposal drafting parts of the bidding process. We were recently acquired by Unanet and have exciting plans making use of the latest developments in multimodal models and agentic frameworks.

Looking for TypeScript engineers with experience using Vue. Experience using AI models, building in Palantir Foundry, and deploying in AWS are all a plus. Clearance is NOT required but a huge plus.

Base salary range is $135,400 to $157,500 (excludes bonus and stock).
