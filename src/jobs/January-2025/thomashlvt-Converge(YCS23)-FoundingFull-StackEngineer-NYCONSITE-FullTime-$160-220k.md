Converge (YC S23) - Founding Full-Stack Engineer - NYC ONSITE - Full Time - $160 - 220k

We scaled to $1M+ in ARR with a team of just 4. Our founding engineer and I are the only ones building the product right now. There&#x27;s so much to build and an insane amount of responsibility to take on over the end product.

Converge makes it easy for marketeers to understand where their customers come from, cut unprofitable channels, and scale when things are working. By vertically integrating the modern data stack (Segment, Fivetran, BigQuery, Looker, etc.) we can offer them a 10x better product experience.
