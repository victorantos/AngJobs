HomeVision - Engineering - Hybrid SFBA (Remote+Onsite) - Full-Time - $150k-$220k + equity

I&#x27;m looking for an early-to-senior software engineer to work with me (CTO) directly. Our systems process millions of pages of documents a month for the mortgage industry and I am looking for a motivated product builder to build our next suite of products, focused on automated decision making.

Skills: practical, ship-today mindset with the ability to use quantitative reasoning to drive practical automation in a massive but antiquated industry.
