Combinaut - REMOTE - Senior Developer, Ruby on Rails - Contract - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkle.health&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkle.health&#x2F;</a>

We’re looking for remote candidates to join our team of kind, hardworking, and creative people!

Our company, Combinaut, creates tools for healthcare organizations that help patients find care (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkle.health&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkle.health&#x2F;</a>). We need an experienced Ruby&#x2F;Rails developer to help build new features and to optimize the existing product. Must have 3 years Ruby on Rails experience. 1 year Vue.js, 1+ year American healthcare, 1 year content management system development preferred.

* Backend powered by Ruby on Rails

* The app has a significant amount of frontend JS components

* We are in the process of migrating front-end components to Vue.js but still use backbone as well

* We have multiple clients with different deployments and customizations to business logic and look’n’feel

* We use Github version control

Our developers work with near-autonomy toward shared goals. We don’t micro-manage. Everyone on our team is trusted to manage their own day, and we value good results over process.

About the project:

* Our team is international (Germany! New Zealand! Spain! Canada!) and all remote, but mostly overlaps with the Pacific or Central time zone.

* It is a large app, been around for many years, so there is a mix of greenfield new features as well as maintenance and improvement of existing features.

* Well-funded team with great cashflow and an established client base.

This is a company that actively maintains work&#x2F;life balance and rejects crunch culture. We work hard to foster an atmosphere of independence and trust in our developers.

To apply: Please email me directly (lisa @ combinaut.com) with your resume and examples of your work. Subject line: Senior Ruby&#x2F;Rails Dev.
