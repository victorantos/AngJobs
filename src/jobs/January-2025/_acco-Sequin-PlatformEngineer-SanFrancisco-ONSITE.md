Sequin - Platform Engineer - San Francisco - ONSITE

We&#x27;re building the world&#x27;s fastest change data capture (CDC) platform for Postgres. CDC is a proven pattern that enables real-time use cases like triggering side effects, fanning out events, caching at the edge, and audit logging - but existing solutions are notoriously difficult to set up and maintain.

We&#x27;re making CDC easy enough for weekend projects yet robust enough for Fortune 500 companies.

Sequin is open source&#x2F;MIT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sequinstream&#x2F;sequin">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sequinstream&#x2F;sequin</a>). We&#x27;re backed by Kleiner Perkins and Craft Ventures.

Tech Stack: Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix, LiveView + Svelte, Postgres

What makes this role exciting:

- Join an early-stage open source project with significant technical influence

- Build a tool you would use for a user you understand

- Work deeply with Postgres

- Solve novel distributed systems challenges (not building CRUD apps)

- Work with Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix and OTP primitives in production

- High-energy environment focused on rapid iteration and customer impactâ€“we ship a lot, and fast!

We&#x27;re based in San Francisco, where we have an office. Learn more: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sequin.notion.site&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sequin.notion.site&#x2F;</a>
