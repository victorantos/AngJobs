Primitive Instruments - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;primitive.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;primitive.tech</a> - NYC or Remote - Full Time or Contract - $150k+

Hey HN, we’re looking for full stack engineers and generalists over at Primitive Instruments Corporation. At Primitive, we make tools that help hardware engineers ship faster. We work with companies building next-gen silicon to startups building small fleets of various devices.

We’ve built a ton already and have customers running their entire CI&#x2F;CD stack through our platform. This includes things like per commit &#x2F; nightly simulation jobs, data retention, hardware observability, and more.

If you’re interested in building next-gen infrastructure for engineers building physical devices (with an awesome and passionate team!), please shoot us an email at work at primitive.tech

Core Technology Stack: Python, Django, GraphQL, React, Next.js, Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ and Kubernetes (also an increasing amount of Rust).

Some Tools&#x2F;Libraries We Use: UV, pnpm, Turborepo, Strawberry GraphQL, Tanstack Query, Shadcn, Click, Celery, Docker, Loki, Prometheus, etc.

Primitive is a small (&lt;5), early-stage VC-funded startup.
