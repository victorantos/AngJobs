Sourcetable - Staff-level Engineers - San Francisco - ONSITE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com</a>

We&#x27;re building an AI spreadsheet and application platform for the next billion people. We are most commonly compared to Sheets&#x2F;Gemini and Excel&#x2F;Copilot, or referred to as &quot;Cursor for Spreadsheets&quot;.

If you are an excellent full-stack engineer (React&#x2F;Python) with good product sense and experience building hard things, please come talk to us. Most of our team are ex-founders, and there is an expectation that you can build end-to-end without requiring assistance from others. AI experience is nice but not required, this is a product engineering role.

There&#x27;s a platform shift underway. Let&#x27;s get after it!
