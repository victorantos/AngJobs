The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is a software product studio and research lab embedded in the Harvard Law School Library, with a mission of bringing library principles to tech. We are currently working on projects including web archiving, remixable education resources, and AI as a new way of accessing knowledge. As a member of our engineering team, the Senior Software Engineer will work across our various tools, applications, and experiments. The ideal candidate will have experience building performant, testable, maintainable, and fault-tolerant products and tools at scale, for audiences both technical and non-technical.
