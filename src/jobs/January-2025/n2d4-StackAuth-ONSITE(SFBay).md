Stack Auth - Full-stack&#x2F;Founding Engineer - ONSITE (SF Bay)

We are Stack Auth, the open-source Auth0 alternative.
We are an early stage startup building for devs like ourselves, and if you&#x27;re passionate about that we should talk. We think that there&#x27;s too much overhead in starting and growing new projects; we&#x27;re here to fix that.

We spend a lot of time thinking about how we can maintain the agility of a startup while being as reliable as larger incumbents. Sometimes, this means new ideas; for example, for our frontend and E2E tests we heavily rely on AI&#x2F;RPA and snapshots, and have API migration tooling that blows everyone else out of the water.

A lot of the work we do is very close to databases and infrastructure, both with the problems we face at scale and the integrations we build for our customers. We are well-funded and backed by YC, Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, Theo Browne, and more.
