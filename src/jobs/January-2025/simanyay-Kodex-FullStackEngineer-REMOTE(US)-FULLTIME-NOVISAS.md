Kodex - Full Stack Engineer - REMOTE (US) - FULL TIME - NO VISAS

ABOUT THE ROLE

We’re seeking an experienced Full Stack Software Engineer to join our growing team and help build the cornerstone of our business: our Law Enforcement Response portal. Kodex is an early stage startup so each engineer wears multiple hats. You will work as part of a small, talented team that includes engineers with experience at successful companies like Medium, HashiCorp, Microsoft, Mozilla, Meta, and Uber. In this role, you will:

- Work closely with our Director of Product to design, develop, and enhance features for our portal.

- Lead projects to optimize system performance, including database usage, encryption middleware, and front-end responsiveness.

- Participate in our on-call rotation (about one week every two months), where you&#x27;ll address support requests, monitor metrics, and respond to incidents to ensure reliability.

- Review code and contribute to improving engineering best practices.

This role is ideal for full-stack generalists with T-shaped skills who thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy taking ownership.

We&#x27;re fully remote, the team is distributed across the continent. We meet up twice a year in various locations around the United States (past meetups were in Miami, Nashville, Seattle, and San Francisco).

We don&#x27;t sponsor visas.

ABOUT KODEX

Kodex creates software that helps private companies handle lawful data requests from governments. Our founders have seen firsthand how difficult it is for public and private sectors to collaborate effectively–preventing real-world harm while respecting user privacy. Slow processes, clunky tools, and misuse by bad actors were common problems. Kodex was built to fix that.

Our platform streamlines case management for Law Enforcement Response and Trust &amp; Safety teams. It combines secure workflows, communication, and file transfers with features like document encryption, audit trails, agency verification, account takeover detection, and API integrations—delivering a complete legal response solution.

Founded in 2021 and backed by Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz, Kodex helps companies securely and efficiently respond to data requests on time.
