Machine Phase Systems - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinephase.systems&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinephase.systems&#x2F;</a> - REMOTE - Software engineering, surface-science physicis, theoretical chemistry, mechanical engineering

Machine Phase Systems is making a straight-shot attempt at the grand vision of molecular nanotechnology: scalable nano factories able to produce atomically precise products using radically new materials.

Open roles for chemistry and surface science, but also CAD&#x2F;CAM software development, chemical simulations, mechanical design, and various internal software tools.

Software stack depends on the application of course, but we work with Rust whenever possible and Flutter&#x2F;Dart for user interfaces and Python for scientific compute.
