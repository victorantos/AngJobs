Stainless - Engineers, EMs, Former Founders, AEs, Business Generalists, more - NYC ONSITE - Full-time

Stainless is building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs.

Our first product is SDKs as a service. I built the codegen system at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.

When you `npm install openai` or `pip install anthropic` or `go get …cloudflare`, for example, you’re downloading code that we generated.

We’re ~3y old, ~20 people, have strong revenue, several years of runway, and great customers (including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare). We’re backed by Sequoia &amp; a16z.

As one of our first 20 engineers, you’ll get autonomy to build great products, skilled peers, opportunity for tremendous impact, and competitive salary, benefits, and equity.

We’re looking for exceptionally productive, thoughtful, tasteful, and kind people with a passion for making software development better for everyone.
