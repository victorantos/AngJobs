Primate Labs - Software Developers - Full-Time, Hybrid (Toronto) or Remote (Canada) - Toronto, Ontario - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.primatelabs.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.primatelabs.com&#x2F;</a>

We develop Geekbench, the popular cross-platform benchmark, and we&#x27;re looking for developers to help us build future versions of Geekbench and Geekbench AI. You will help develop and characterize benchmarks for future versions of Geekbench. This is a great position for developers interested in computer performance, high-level and low-level software optimization, and cross-platform development.

The ideal candidate has experience with C++ and experience working on a small team. It would be nice if you had experience with any of the following technologies (but by all means these are not mandatory): C++11, SIMD instruction sets (e.g., SSE, AVX, NEON, or RVV), and code optimization and profiling tools.

Interested? Send me an email at john@primatelabs.com and let&#x27;s chat.
