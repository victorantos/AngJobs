REMOTE - UNITY - CONSULTANT&#x2F;DEVELOPER - VIDEO GAME MODDING

Hiring a consultant Unity developer to initially advise on a new project in March&#x2F;April with the long term work either just consultation, management or full time development afterwards.

We rely heavily on modding and extracting data from the video game Football Manager which is being rewritten in the Unity engine for its latest version slated for release in March or April 2025.

We are looking for a Unity expert to help assess the new game and identify possible modding capabilities as soon as it is released and then work together to make a long term plan to mod the game.

We are open to working with a long term solo developer or creating a team of individuals. Until the game is released we will not know the full requirements. However we would like to have someone available to get started on the day of release, hence the flexibility of being just consultancy initially.

100% remote and flexible on hours.
