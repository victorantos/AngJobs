Privy - NYC or Remote - Staff Frontend, Full-Stack, React Native, Infra Roles - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;privy.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;privy.io</a>

Hi, I&#x27;m Asta, CTO at the identity and fintech infra startup Privy. We build a cryptographic key management API that hundreds of companies integrate in order to onboard (25M+) users onto products built with blockchain infra and distributed systems.

Our mission is to power digital ownership for all users. We believe that using digital assets to power money movement online is the next frontier for user ownership and financial empowerment. We&#x27;re building foundational infrastructure that enables this.

We&#x27;re a small, high-ownership team building a product with incredibly scaled usage (&gt;5M MAUs, massive transaction volume). We&#x27;ve raised $26M from Sequoia &amp; Paradigm. We ship constantly, multiple production releases every week.
