Kadoa - Multiple roles - Remote - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com</a>

We’re automating web scraping at scale with AI.

But we can&#x27;t do it alone. We are looking for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship, data, and AI. We are growing fast, have a “no-bullshit” policy, and try to minimize the distance between the code you ship and the customers who use it.

We have openings for:

- Web Scraping Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;web-scraping-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;web-scraping-engineer</a>

- Frontend Developer&#x2F;UX Designer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;frontend-dev-ux-designer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;frontend-dev-ux-designer</a>

If that sounds like you, please email me at (adrian at kadoa dot com) and mention HN in the subject line.
