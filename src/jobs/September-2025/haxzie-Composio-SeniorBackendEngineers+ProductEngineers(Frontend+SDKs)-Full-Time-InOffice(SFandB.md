Composio - Senior Backend Engineers + Product Engineers (Frontend + SDKs) - Full-Time - In Office (SF and Bengaluru, India)

Hi HN, we’re building <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;composio.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;composio.dev</a>
 — the fastest way for AI agents and developers to take action across apps like GitHub, Gmail, Slack, and more. Our SDKs (TypeScript + Python) and APIs let developers connect and execute tools in just a few lines of code.

We’re a small, fast-moving team obsessed with developer experience. Our stack is TypeScript-heavy: backend in TS&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Python, frontend in React&#x2F;Next.js, SDKs in TS&#x2F;Python. You’ll work across product and engineering to define APIs, craft abstractions, and ship features used by thousands of developers.

We’re early stage, small team and looking for engineers who want ownership and impact.

Feel free to reach out to me with your resume and links of your work: musthaq@composio.dev
