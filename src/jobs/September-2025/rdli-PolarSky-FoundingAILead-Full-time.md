Polar Sky - Founding AI Lead - Bay Area&#x2F;Seattle - Hybrid&#x2F;Onsite - Full-time

We&#x27;re a well-funded, pre-seed cybersecurity startup focused on data security. I&#x27;m looking for a founding AI lead with experience in fine-tuning LLMs (expertise around RL + reasoning models a big plus). This person would own the full AI stack from data to training to eval to test-time compute.

Who&#x27;s a good fit:

* If you&#x27;ve always thought about starting a company, but for whatever reason (funding, life, idea), this is a great opportunity to be part of the founding team. We&#x27;re 2 people right now.

* You enjoy understanding customer problems and their use cases, and then figuring out the best solution (sometimes technical, sometimes not) to their problems.

* You want to help figure out what a company looks like in this AI era.

* You enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge.

Questions, interest, just email jobs@polarsky.ai.
