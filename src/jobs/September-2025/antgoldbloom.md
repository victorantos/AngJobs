As background, we are building a knowledge graph from web data with a first focus on data for go-to-market teams. We use sources like job posts and resume data to identify things like org structure, tech stack, and key projects (e.g., GenAI initiatives, cloud migrations). Our product already has strong product-market fit, early revenue, and happy customers — and now we’re ready to accelerate.

Our long-term vision is to become the primary destination for accessing high-quality web data. Try the product at sumble.com.

We are a team of 15, including 10 engineers with experience at companies such as Google, Meta, Stack Overflow, and Kaggle.
