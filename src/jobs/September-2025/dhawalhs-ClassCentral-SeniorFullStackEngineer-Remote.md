Class Central - Senior Full Stack Engineer - Remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classcentral.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classcentral.com</a>

I&#x27;m looking for a senior engineer to take ownership (from me) of Class Central&#x27;s codebase and infrastructure.

We help tens of millions of learners find the best courses on any subject. Small team (6 people), profitable, independent, and around for 13+ years. No VC drama, just sustainable growth.

Stack: PHP 8+, Symfony 7+, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Google Cloud. We keep it simple and productive.

Own the full stack, help shape our product, and build pragmatic solutions for our current scale.  I am looking for product-minded engineers who are focused on user experience and driven to understand the business.

I&#x27;m building a new cross-functional product team from scratch (engineering, product, design). Looking for a foundational engineer who can mentor, collaborate, and help define how we work together.

Remote-first, async, very few meetings. Real autonomy, real impact. Fair warning: being fully remote means no annual Halloween Heists.

While I don&#x27;t have a formal job post up yet, if you&#x27;re at that point where this feels like the right next step, I&#x27;d be happy to hear from you: careers@classcentral.com
