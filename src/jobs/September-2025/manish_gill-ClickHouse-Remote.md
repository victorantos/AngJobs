ClickHouse - Senior Software Engineer - Distributed Systems &#x2F; Cloud Data Infrastructure &#x2F; Kubernetes - Remote

(US preferred right now, EU is technically fine but I&#x27;m looking to ramp up in US atm)

ClickHouse is a popular, Open-Source OLAP Database. We are ClickHouse Inc, the company behind the database aiming to build the best in class real time data warehouse.

What we are looking for:

Distributed Systems &#x2F; Cloud Engineers to build the AutoScaling Systems for a Cloud Database.

We also maintain our own ClickHouse-based Data Infrastructure. Bonus points if you&#x27;ve worked on auto-scaling or other data-driven forecasting challenges in the past.

<pre><code>    Can work in an early stage startup environment. Proactive and hands on.

    You must be independent and self-organised.

    Good at Go, Kubernetes (Understanding how to manage stateful services in a multi-cloud environment)

    We have a Python service in our Recommendation pipeline, so some ML&#x2F;Data Science knowledge would be good.

    SQL &#x2F; ClickHouse SQL (goes without saying)

    You&#x27;ll need to be able to do On-Call - debugging production infra or db issues

    If you can do low-level database programming (C++, ClickHouse) that&#x27;s added bonus.
</code></pre>
If you want to work on operating production critical databases in the cloud on k8s + write data-driven algorithms for autoscaling, consider applying!

PS: If you&#x27;re a pure DevOps person or a pure Data Engineer who wrangles data tools, please consider the above requirements before firing off an email. This role is an intersection of a lot of sub-roles, not a particular specialization.
