Riverline (Bengaluru, India) - Full-Stack AI Engineers - ONSITE - CTC ₹20–35 LPA

Riverline is building AI agents for debt collections — think voice + WhatsApp agents that negotiate, resolve, and collect at scale. Backed by South Park Commons, DeVC, and gradCapital.

We’re looking for cracked engineers who:

<pre><code>   - Ship fast and own things end-to-end (frontend → backend → AI integrations).

   - Treat AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, GPT-5) as part of their daily workflow.

   - Can vibe-code and debug chaos without waiting for perfect PRDs or hand-holding.
</code></pre>
Our stack: Python, TypeScript, FastAPI, React, MongoDB, Docker, AWS, LiveKit, Redis.
