Houmanoids - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;houmanoids.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;houmanoids.com</a> - Lots of roles

We&#x27;re integrating robots in and around buildings (focused in America for now). Example usecases:

- security guards, doormen, receptionists (low mobility using humanoids)

- security patrol around perimeter of buildings (high mobility using dogs)

- moving things&#x2F;packages within a building (last step package delivery)

We are building on top of Unitree&#x27;s hardware and there&#x27;s lots to do.

- abstraction layer similar to Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android

- appstore

- example reference apps (think mail, calculator, camera, maps)

996 work environment due to collaboration&#x2F;communication requirements with folks in China and insatiable demand for deploying robots.
