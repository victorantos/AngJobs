Vantage is a FinOps &#x2F; Cloud Cost Management platform that helps 15,000+ organizations globally like Block, Rippling, FanDuel, CircleCI, etc manage their infrastructure costs. We are a ruby&#x2F;rails shop and if you love infrastructure, it&#x27;s a very interesting role as our customers are others like you looking to manage their infra spend.

The company is headquartered in NYC but US-remote friendly (sorry, we can&#x27;t handle international at this time).
