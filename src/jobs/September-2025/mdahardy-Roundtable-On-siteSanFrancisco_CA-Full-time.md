Roundtable - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roundtable.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roundtable.ai</a> - On-site San Francisco, CA - Full-time

Roundtable is a research and deployment company building the proof-of-human layer in digital identity. Roundtable seeks to research and build real-world Turing Tests, and to productize these developments in bot detection, fraud prevention, and continuous authentication.

We&#x27;re hiring a Member of Technical Staff. This is not a typical “Founding Engineer” position. In particular, this role will involve more research than similar positions. You should be prepared to spend around half of your time on research and half on engineering.

The ideal candidate has experience in both. However, we don’t strictly require research experience as long as you have a strong quantitative background and an eagerness to learn. We do require proficiency in both web development (Javascript, Node.js) and Python.

If you&#x27;re interested shoot an email to matt@roundtable.ai with your resume and a short blurb on why you&#x27;re interested (note: we are unable to offer visa sponsorship at this time).
