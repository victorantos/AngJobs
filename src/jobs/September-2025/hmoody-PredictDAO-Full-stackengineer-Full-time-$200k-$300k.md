PredictDAO is a blockchain-based nonprofit global health organization building prediction markets for real-world public goods in the healthcare sector. The intended users for our tools include foundations, aid agencies, and high-net worth individuals.

We are pre-launch, with two full-time employees at the moment, and interested in finding another engineer who is excited about our mission of saving and improving lives by filling some of the funding gaps caused by recent budget cuts to USAID.
