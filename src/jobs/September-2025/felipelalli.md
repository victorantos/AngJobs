[REMOTE] Expert Software Architect (Core &amp; Reliability)

At Eulen Labs, we build products for the sovereign individual, with a focus on security, privacy, and technical excellence. We are looking for a battle-tested, hands-on architect to become the guardian of our core production systems.

The Role

This is a deeply technical, hands-on position for a master craftsperson who prefers architecting and shipping brilliant code to attending meetings. As the technical owner of our high-volume core services, you will be the gatekeeper of quality, the champion of reliability, and the calm voice of reason during a crisis. Your mission: to ensure our systems run with unwavering stability and speed, enabling us to deploy frequently and safely.

Who We&#x27;re Looking For

We are seeking an expert with 15+ years of software engineering experience in critical, high-volume environments. You are a pragmatist who lives and breathes automated testing, resilient architecture, and the relentless pursuit of improvement. You have a history of leading incident responses and a passion for mentoring others through exemplary code and rigorous reviews.
