Terrace Networks - Security Data Systems Engineer - REMOTE (US) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terracenetworks.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.terracenetworks.com</a>

We’re hiring engineers to build the next generation of large-scale network threat intelligence. Our distributed vantage point is one of the world’s most diverse, and we’re using AI to make sense of global attack data in real time.

I’m Eric, co-founder and CEO. Our founding team includes researchers with decades of security experience and multiple successful startup exits.

We’re looking for full-time engineers who thrive at the intersection of systems, security, and machine learning. Ideal candidates bring a strong background in systems engineering, familiarity with modern ML for text&#x2F;log analysis, and interest in automated response systems (e.g. LLM-based agents for classification, triage, response). Proven success working remotely is a plus.

We&#x27;ve recently closed our seed round; pay+equity will be based on experience and fit.

*Tech:* Go, Linux, TCP&#x2F;IP internals, Terraform, DynamoDB, LLMs (Claude, etc.)
