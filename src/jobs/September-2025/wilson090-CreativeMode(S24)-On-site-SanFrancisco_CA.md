CreativeMode (S24) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativemode.net">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativemode.net</a> - On-site - San Francisco, CA

CreativeMode is building Lovable for video game mods, starting with Minecraft. In our first three months, we built the most powerful no-code modding platform ever for Minecraft and created a double digit percentage of all mods ever released. We&#x27;re building an entirely new category of gaming tools. Minecraft is only the beginning.

We&#x27;re hiring a Founding Engineer who wants to build at the intersection of tech and gaming. Ideal candidates have a passion for the category and have experience building production-level LLM&#x2F;AI applications or are killer full-stack engineers who can own product features end to end.

Ideally 3+ years of experience
