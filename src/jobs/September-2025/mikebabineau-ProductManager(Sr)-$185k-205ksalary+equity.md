Turnstile (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tryturnstile.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tryturnstile.com</a>) - REMOTE (US&#x2F;Canada) - Product Manager (Sr) - $185k-205k salary + equity

---

We&#x27;re a small (23-person) team of repeat founders and seasoned operators building a next-gen quote-to-cash platform. This is a tight-knit and senior crew — most of us have 10-25 years&#x27; experience, much of it together. The last company we built, Second Measure (YC S15), scaled to 70+ people and tens of millions in revenue, and was ultimately acquired by Bloomberg in a landmark deal.

We&#x27;ve built a category-defining product and are now gearing up to scale. We&#x27;re looking for our third Product Manager to help shape the future of our platform.

We&#x27;re well-funded by top investors (First Round plus more to be announced), fully distributed, and known (and recognized) for building intentional, inclusive culture. We offer competitive global rates (SF salary + equity), equal pay by level, and comprehensive, family-friendly benefits.

I&#x27;m Mike, one of the founders— if interested, apply here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;turnstile&#x2F;3ef0ec7d-325f-421d-82ec-4c6457385efb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;turnstile&#x2F;3ef0ec7d-325f-421d-82ec-4...</a>) and mention this post.
