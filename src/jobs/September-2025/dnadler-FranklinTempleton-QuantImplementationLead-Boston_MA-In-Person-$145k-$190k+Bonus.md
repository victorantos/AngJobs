Franklin Templeton - Quant Implementation Lead - Boston, MA - In-Person - $145k - $190k + Bonus

We&#x27;re building an end-to-end portfolio construction system to support FTIS, a $100bn multi-asset investment manager within FT. This is a front office role that will help guide our quantitative staff as we build out this new system. This project is a strategic objective for FTIS, highly visible, and frankly one of the most fun jobs in the industry.

We&#x27;re looking for mid to senior level researchers or developers with strong buy-side backgrounds who can help translate our investment process into a robust, scalable, and approachable design.
