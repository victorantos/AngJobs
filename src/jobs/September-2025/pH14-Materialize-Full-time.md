Materialize - NYC Onsite &#x2F; Hybrid - Full-time

Materialize is the live data layer for apps and AI agents. It lets your team use SQL to create up-to-the-second views into any element of your business. Use Materialize to power data-intensive UIs, deliver fresh context to AI agents, and create event-driven architectures to power core business processes. Materialize is trusted by General Mills, Ryder, and Fubo.tv to solve their most pressing real-time data challenges.

Under the hood, Materialize is a novel distributed database capable of incremental view maintenance over arbitrary SQL. We think it&#x27;s pretty cool :D

We are generally hiring for more database engineers! Lots of hard distributed systems and database problems to untangle these days:
