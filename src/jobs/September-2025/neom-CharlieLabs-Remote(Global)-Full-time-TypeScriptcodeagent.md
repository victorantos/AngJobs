Charlie Labs - Remote (Global) - Full-time - TypeScript code agent

We’re building an AI teammate that fixes bugs, writes features, and reviews PRs asynchronously. Small team, big surface area.

Open roles

Full-Stack Product Engineer (TS&#x2F;React, Next.js, design-system chops)

Backend Engineer (event&#x2F;queue systems, GCP, BigQuery, observability)

AI Engineer (LLM agents, eval-driven iteration, tool use, reliability)

Developer Relations (TypeScript demos, fun stuff, talks, OSS)

Our stack 
TypeScript across the stack - GCP (Cloud Run, Pub&#x2F;Sub, BigQuery, IAM, Secrets)

Why Charlie?
Tiny team → outsized ownership and velocity
Remote-first, async-native; few meetings, lots of shipping
Real runway (seed $10M) and meaningful equity
