Hello. I’m the founder of Talk Machine, previously founded Citymapper.

We’re working on building a consumer voice product &#x2F; platform using AI, driven by the mission to improve human communication.

Our application process is unique. Just go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs</a> and send us a voice note and we can begin talking, just like we met in person.

We have 2 specific posts, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;engineer</a> for full stack founding engineers and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;mobile" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;mobile</a> for iOS&#x2F;Android, but glad to hear from anyone that loves the product&#x2F;category.

We’re seed funded and can pay competitively + quality stock options (EMI in UK).
