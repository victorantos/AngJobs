ScribbleVet (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scribblevet.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scribblevet.com</a>) - Full-stack, former technical founders - Full-time - Remote (must be able to work US timezones)

ScribbleVet is an AI-powered scribe for veterinarians. We save veterinarians two hours every day, reduce veterinary burnout and help animals get better care.

* We&#x27;re generating real ($XM&#x2F;yr) revenue

* Our users love the product

* We&#x27;re fully remote but not asynchronous, so we have a lot of autonomy but it&#x27;s easy to collaborate with someone when needed.

We&#x27;re looking for:

* Senior engineers (former founders or early startup experience strongly preferred) who can work across the stack.

* Engineers with a product mindset. Customer-centricity or design skills are a plus.

Our tech stack: Postgres, Elixir (+ Ash framework), React Native&#x2F;Expo, React&#x2F;Nextjs

Weâ€™ve found that the engineers who are happy and successful at Scribble really enjoy technology (learning new frameworks, experimenting with cutting-edge platforms) and are very product-oriented.
