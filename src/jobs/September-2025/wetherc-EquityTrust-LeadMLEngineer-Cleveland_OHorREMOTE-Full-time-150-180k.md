Equity Trust - Lead ML Engineer - Cleveland, OH or REMOTE - Full-time - 150 - 180k

Equity Trust is a custodian of self-directed IRAs that gives clients the tools to manage their own retirement accounts, and to invest in a range of traditional and alternative assets. We have been helping clients steer their own retirement accounts for over 50 years, and now have over 400,000 accounts, and over $65 billion in assets, under custody. We have offices in Ohio, Florida, Texas, and South Dakota if in-person work is your jam, but fully support remote work as well.

The role: We&#x27;re looking to add a founding ML engineer to build out our data science practice (and ideally hire and lead a data science team). You would be our first ML hire and working alongside our data engineering and product teams to identify, scope, POC, and productionize relevant analytic use cases to help drive new and improved product offerings, and to elevate our client experience.  Our data eng stack is mostly Python + AWS, and you will have the resources and support to develop an ML stack alongside that. Generally, if you like working with data, tackling open-ended problems, and (optionally, but always nice) building cool products to help folks take a more active role in their investments --- you&#x27;ll probably have a good time here!
