N43 Studio is a venture studio dedicated to building bold, technology-driven companies from the ground up. We identify emerging opportunities, develop ideas into working prototypes, and launch ventures designed to scale.

We’re hiring a full-time, Senior Full Stack Engineer to join our first product pod and help bring our first venture to life. You’ll work alongside a product manager, front-end engineer, and back-end engineer, supported by a Principal Architect and the studio leadership team. You’ll have autonomy, clear ownership, and the chance to shape both the product and our technical foundations from day one. This is a hybrid role, 3 days a week based out of our Toronto office.

What We’re Looking For

- 5+ years of experience building full-stack web applications, ideally in startup or venture environments.
- Strong proficiency in Python, particularly with modern frameworks like FastAPI or Flask. Experience in other backend languages (e.g., Node.js, Go) is a bonus, but Python is our primary stack.
- Proficiency with modern frontend frameworks such as React and TypeScript.
- Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (GCP preferred) and DevOps best practices.
- Comfort working in high-ambiguity, high-velocity environments with a lean, collaborative team.
- A builder mindset—you’re as comfortable iterating in code as you are thinking about product.
