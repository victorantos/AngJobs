At Continua (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;</a>), we&#x27;re on our way to solving Social AI, and we&#x27;re expanding our team! We&#x27;ve built an AI agent that users can invite into group conversations to make planning, coordination, and information retrieval effortless. We&#x27;re social creatures and it just seemed to us a huge opportunity to bring AI into group settings. We&#x27;ve seen strong retention over the last few months and want you to help us bring our product to the next level. Try adding our agent at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;</a> to group chats and kick the tires!

I’m David (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dpetrou&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dpetrou&#x2F;</a>), the founder and CEO. Before starting Continua, I was a Distinguished Software Engineer at Google. We’re backed by top-tier VCs and incredible angel investors. Our team is a fantastic bunch (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;team" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;team</a>) of accomplished engineers and researchers from Google, Slack, Disney, and several AI startups. We&#x27;re pretty clued in on the technology side and have a strong vision of how the transformative technology of the last few years along with our own secret sauce (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) can help a huge number of people.

We’re hiring a Senior&#x2F;Staff Machine Learning Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;continua&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;continua&#x2F;</a>

You&#x27;ll work on building and improving the best LLM group chat experience there is, including fine-tuning models to boost conversational quality and improve scalability and identifying novel ways to build a &quot;memory&quot; which leads to a personalized and unique experience for our users. You&#x27;re an experienced machine learning engineer with broad knowledge and skills and have experience fine-tuning LLMs for both generative and discriminative use cases. You have a Master&#x27;s or PhD in Machine Learning (or a Bachelor’s with exceptional industry experience). You understand what it means to work at a fast-moving startup.

Oh, and we maintain a vibrant blog, including items of technical interest, at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.continua.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.continua.ai&#x2F;</a>. Check it out! :)
