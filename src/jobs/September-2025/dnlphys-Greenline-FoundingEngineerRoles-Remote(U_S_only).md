Greenline unlocks mortgage lending for self-employed borrowers.

We just closed our seed round led by Bowery Capital and Uncork to tackle this messy problem. More importantly, we&#x27;re launching with the largest lenders and investors in the mortgage-backed securities market.

We&#x27;re growing our founding team:

- product&#x2F; full stack engineer: own and accelerate customer-facing feature development

- backend: lead core, data-centric systems and infrastructure

- platform&#x2F; API: architect and build a public-facing ergonomic API for scalable integrations with enterprise systems, critical to unlocking key customers and partner-driven growth.
