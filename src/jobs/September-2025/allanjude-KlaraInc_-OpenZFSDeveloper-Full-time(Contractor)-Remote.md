Klara Inc. - OpenZFS Developer - Full-time (Contractor) - Remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klarasystems.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openzfs-developer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klarasystems.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openzfs-developer&#x2F;</a>

Klara provides open source development services with a focus on ZFS, FreeBSD, and Arm. Our mission is to advance technology through community-driven development while maintaining the ethics and creativity of open source. We help customers standardize and accelerate platforms built on ZFS by combining internal expertise with active participation in the community.

We are excited to share that we are looking to expand our OpenZFS team with an additional full-time Developer.

Our ZFS developer team works directly on OpenZFS for customers and with upstream to add features, investigating performance issues, and resolve complex bugs. Recently our team has upstreamed Fast Dedup, critical fixes for ZFS native encryption, improvements to gang block allocation, and has even more out for review (the new AnyRAID feature).

The ideal candidate will have experience working with ZFS or other Open Source projects in the kernel.

If you are interested in joining our team please contact us at zfs-hire@klarasystems.com or apply through the form here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klarasystems.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openzfs-developer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klarasystems.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;openzfs-developer&#x2F;</a>
