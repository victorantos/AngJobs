We’re a fast-moving team of aviators, engineers, and operators on a mission to transform aviation with an AI platform that makes flying safer, more efficient, and more capable. Backed by top investors and having already secured a dozen Department of Defense contracts and worked with three major airlines, we’re flying through barriers and working on a mission that matters.

At Beacon AI, there are no silos or layers of overhead. Small, focused teams own what they build, ship fast, and learn even faster. Every line of code, data pipeline, or system we design pushes the boundaries of how humans and AI work together in the cockpit and beyond. If you thrive at the intersection of hard-tech ambition and mission urgency, you’ll build faster here than anywhere else.

Open Roles:

++ Backend Software Engineers - Multiple Seniority Levels

++ Cloud Infrastructure Software Engineers - Multiple Seniority Levels

++ Cloud IoT Software Engineers - Multiple Seniority Levels

++ Backend &amp; Cloud Infra Technical Lead Manager
