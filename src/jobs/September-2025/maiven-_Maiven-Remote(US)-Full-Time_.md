*Maiven - Full-Stack Engineer &amp; Energy Modeling Engineer - Remote (US) - Full-Time*

Maiven is the software platform automating home decarbonization. We’re a small, mission-driven team punching way above our weight: we have large utility customers, contracts in multiple states, and a growing pipeline of programs launching later this year. We’re venture backed and moving fast.

We’re hiring two engineers:

- *Full-Stack Engineer* – NestJS, React, Tailwind, TypeScript, Python, Postgres, AWS, Lambdas. Someone who cares deeply about UX and moving fast while delighting the user.
- *Energy Modeling Engineer* – Python, pandas, AWS, modeling frameworks (ResStock, EnergyPlus, etc.). Experience with energy programs or building science is a huge plus.

Looking for builders who want real ownership, thrive in early-stage startups, and move with urgency and care.
