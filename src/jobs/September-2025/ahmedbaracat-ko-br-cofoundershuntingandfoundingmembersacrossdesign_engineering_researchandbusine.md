ko-br - cofounders hunting and founding members across design, engineering, research and business development - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ko-br.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ko-br.com</a> - Onsite (SF, USA)

Looking for another technical cofounder, a commercial cofounder (work closely with Stacey, our advisor and ex-CCO of universal Robots) and founding members. If interested, let’s catchup over coffee in sf in sep.

P.S. we are closing our pre-seed round soon so don’t worry about our runway :)

It’s a shame that we have unbelievably good hardware like collaborative robots (cobots) that could transform warehouses and yet they still struggle with basic tasks like unloading mixed pallets. Why? Because today&#x27;s software can&#x27;t handle real-world chaos.

That&#x27;s where we come in. At ko-br, we&#x27;re building the AI brains that make robots truly adaptable. Our physical AI models tackle messy, unstructured problems starting with depalletizing of mixed boxes in dynamic warehouses. Think real-time adaptation to shifting pallets, mixed SKUs, and unexpected failures.

We&#x27;re a deep tech startup at the crossroads of AI, robotics, and human-machine interface. While warehouses are our first battlefield, our core mission is physical AI. So you need to be comfortable with the idea of pivoting to other sectors like education (ex: building robots for schools and universities).
