Stack Auth (S24) - San Francisco, CA - Full-time

Hiring founding &amp; design engineers!

We&#x27;re building the customer platform for developers â€” think of a single service that does auth, payments, analytics, marketing emails, and so much more. We&#x27;re selling to developers &amp; startups so our audience is right here on this website!

If you&#x27;re in San Francisco and frequent Hacker News, that&#x27;s enough of a reason to DM me on Twitter @konstiwohlwend. Would love to invite you over for a coffee at our hacker house!

If you apply, please send me a few recent HN threads that you enjoyed :)
