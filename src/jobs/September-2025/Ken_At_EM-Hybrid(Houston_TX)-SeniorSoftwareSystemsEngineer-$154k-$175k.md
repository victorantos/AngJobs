Erdos Miller (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erdosmiller.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erdosmiller.com</a>) - Hybrid (Houston, TX) - Senior Software Systems Engineer - $154k - $175k

I&#x27;ve got to be honest. At Erdos Miller, we’re good at software, but we’re not great—yet.

We build crazy products, including ToolHub, which is a web app that literally communicates directly to our embedded hardware.

We want to hire someone who truly cares about solving customer problems and bringing everything together to make great software products.

This is your chance to lead a small team, set the technical direction, make tough compromises, and commercialize real products that delight customers.

No red tape. No investors. No hype cycle. Just build and ship real products.

Sometimes even without AI features.

If you aim to be the best in the world at what you do, let&#x27;s chat.

We work a lot of hardware, so this is a hybrid Houston-based role.
