Phrasing - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app</a> - EU Remote - Co-founder

Phrasing is the best way to learn and maintain multiple languages [1]. With support for over 120 languages, science-based methodologies, and a beautiful custom built UI, Phrasing make’s it easier than ever to learn a language… or 10.

Phrasing is built with Elixir on the backend (lots of Broadway, FLAME, Nx and Scholar) with a ClojureScript front end. Everything is stored in a single Postgres database hosted with neon. I’m moving some code to a commons library, with the end goal of using Clojure as an isomorphic solution to run the same code on web, server, and mobile (&lt;1% of the codebase, just the critical logic). The front-end is moving from Reagent+React to HSX+Preact+Preact Signals, although that’s going to be a long and slow migration.

Phrasing is my attempt to do something different [2], from both a product and a business perspective. No investments, no hyper scaling, no growth hacking — just tripling down on building the most effective application to learn a language.

Phrasing is launched, live, has some DAUs and MRR. However, long ago I’ve reached the limit of what one developer can do. I’m looking for someone to

<pre><code>  - come on board and take over the entire Elixir codebase
  - watch the Broadway Pipelines, and not sleep if there are any failing checkpoints 
  - optimize request times, reduce database pressure, and speed up extraction times
  - work with me to restructure things to reduce costs&#x2F;complexity
  - work towards training novel embedding spaces, custom classic ML&#x2F;NLP models, and long term algorithmic improvements to the SRS [3]
  - see this as a fun challenge, and have enough ownership of the product that I can focus on some user facing developments [4]
</code></pre>
Please note, I’m not looking to hire an engineer to work a 9-5, and I am in no hurry to hire someone soon. I’m looking for a co-founder to come on board, take ownership and accelerate the product. The product is built, working, and growing organically. While there is some MRR, the position will be rev-share &amp; equity focused until the business produces enough for full salaries.

To apply, please send an introduction hn at phrasing dot app. I will not be interviewing until the 12th of September, and no priority will be given to earlier or later applicants, so there is no rush. A sincere, well-written introduction is your best way to get an interview. No experience is required for this role, so long as you’re competent and hungry.
