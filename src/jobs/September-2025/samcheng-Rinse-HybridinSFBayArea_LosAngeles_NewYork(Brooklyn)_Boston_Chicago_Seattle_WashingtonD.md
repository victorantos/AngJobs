Rinse - IT Manager &#x2F; Network Administrator &#x2F; System Administrator - Hybrid in SF Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York (Brooklyn), Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Washington DC, or Newark. (Primarily remote with some on-site responsibilities.) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rinse.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rinse.com</a>

Rinse provides dry cleaning and laundry delivery services to customers in eleven metropolitan areas in the US. We have sophisticated logistics optimization software, a polished consumer product, and firm business fundamentals. We&#x27;re now over a decade old - this is a stable, yet consistently growing and innovating, company.

Given our distributed nature, we have growing network and workstation infrastructure, and it&#x27;s time to hire our first full-time leader to manage this system.  The ideal candidate can:

- Operate with autonomy and integrity across network, server, infrastructure, and desktop environments

- Communicate cross-functionally, to internal stakeholders at all levels

- Navigate our (primarily Linux) technical environment

- Spearhead projects to improve our technology&#x27;s security, reliability, and functionality

- Facilitate our corporate efficiency via desktop administration

Because this role has some physical hardware responsibilities, we&#x27;d prefer it be filled by someone in the above localities, even though the vast majority of the role can be performed remotely.

We&#x27;re open to both newly-graduated or more senior technically-minded individuals and managers, provided they meet our bar.
