Saris AI - Full-Stack + ML Engineers - Full-Time - Onsite &#x2F; Remote - Montreal, Canada

Hi HN, we are an YC alum founding team rethinking back-office workflows for banks and credit unions. We&#x27;re tackling a $100 billion problem with the kind of automation problems that require long-context reasoning, tool orchestration across many critical systems, and strict compliance loops: the ones without known answers.

We&#x27;ve shipped real agents that handle real customer workflows in production. With a growing customer base and live deployments, we&#x27;re scaling up fast and looking for deeply technical builders who want to have outsized impact early.
