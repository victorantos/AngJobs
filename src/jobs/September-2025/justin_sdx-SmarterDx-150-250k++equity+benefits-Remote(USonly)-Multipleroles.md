We build clinical AI that empowers hospitals to analyze the complete record of every patient to fully capture the value of care delivered. Founded by physicians in 2020, our proprietary AI platform understands the nuances of clinical reasoning, enabling hospitals to accurately reflect every patient visit for fair reimbursement. By doing so, hospitals can recover millions in earned revenue, enhance care outcome and quality metrics, and optimize healthcare operations.

The current team is very high functioning (MD + data scientist combos, former ASF board member, Google and Amazon engineers, Stanford LLM researchers, etc.) and initially scaled the company to $1MM+ in contracted revenue without raising capital.

We have been backed by top investors including Floodgate (Lyft, Twitch, Twitter), Transformation Capital, and Bessemer for a total of $71M, including our $50M Series B, and are experiencing an incredible growth trajectory customer and revenue wise with no signs of slowing down with 150% YoY headcount growth! This time last year, we were at ~90 employees, and are above 225 as of today!

We are looking for: Senior Platform Engineer - Staff and Senior SWEs, Full Stack and Backend focused - Staff ML Engineers - A Director of Engineering for our Product groups - Data Science Managers - Staff Data Scientists - Senior Data Analysts - More!

We have PMF, and it&#x27;s time to scale! For more and to apply, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smarterdx.com&#x2F;careers</a>
