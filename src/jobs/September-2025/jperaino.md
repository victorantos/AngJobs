Norm is building AI that understands regulations for regulatory compliance. Our AI currently automates compliance determinations for federally regulated financial content, though our vision is to build a platform that can handle any regulation in any industry. As AI begins to permeate our society, Norm aims to become a critical building block for other AI systems that need regulatory intelligence. You can read more about our vision here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norm.ai&#x2F;post&#x2F;building-regulatory-ai-agents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norm.ai&#x2F;post&#x2F;building-regulatory-ai-agents</a>

We&#x27;ve raised $87m from top-tier investors to pursue this vision. We&#x27;re growing very quickly and have major, household-name financial institutions as clients and investors. We&#x27;re working on hard, interesting problems and want to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible for AI-driven products. We&#x27;re hiring for many engineering roles, including:

- Full Stack Engineer, Senior + Staff ($190k-270k)

- Design Engineer, Senior + Staff ($190k-270k)

- Staff Frontend Engineer ($235-270k)

- Applied AI Engineer ($200k-275k)

- Cloud Infrastructure Engineer ($175k-250k)

- Forward Deployed Engineer ($190k-250k)

- Quality Engineering Lead ($130k - 185k)

We&#x27;re also hiring for many non-technical roles. The best way to apply is online on our website (we review every application!).
