zoetro.pe - Technical Staff - San Francisco, CA - ONSITE&#x2F;REMOTE - Full-time

We&#x27;re an applied lab building deterministic and deep generative experiences. Our team has built AI models, games, and infrastucture at Tesla Autopilot, Epic Games, Scale.ai, Repl.it, Bun, and Lucasarts.

You will be building procedural simulation models and the supporting infrastructure and applications. We&#x27;re a small team, so this means everything from CUDA kernels and Pytorch notebooks to web-apps. Our stack is multi-lingual and spans from very low to very high level code. We use both our own models and external providers.

Our team is hybrid-remote, being primarily based in San Francisco.

Our stack: Python (Pytorch&#x2F;jax), Typescript(React etc), Rust&#x2F;C++, Ghidra

We&#x27;re looking for exceptional research engineers who aren&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty. Experience with computational geometry or compilers&#x2F;language design&#x2F;formal methods is a plus.

Formal qualifications are less important than passion and skill. We&#x27;re building our dreams, we hope you will feel the same.
