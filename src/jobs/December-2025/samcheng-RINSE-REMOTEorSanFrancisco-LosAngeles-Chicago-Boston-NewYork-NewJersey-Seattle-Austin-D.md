Rinse provides dry cleaning and laundry delivery services to customers in twelve metropolitan areas in the US and Canada. We have sophisticated logistics optimization software, a polished consumer product, and firm business fundamentals. We&#x27;re now over a decade old - this is a stable, yet consistently growing and innovating, company.

Our engineering team is distributed across the United States and internationally, and has been entirely remote for years now, but a desk can be provided in the above cities if you&#x27;d prefer.

We&#x27;re open to both newly-graduated engineers or more senior engineers, provided they meet our bar. We&#x27;re particularly interested in true full-stack engineers, with strong React &#x2F; Typescript &#x2F; CSS skills to complement comfort in a Python &#x2F; Django environment.  We&#x27;re also seeking engineers with experience leveraging AI to automate complex operational processes.
