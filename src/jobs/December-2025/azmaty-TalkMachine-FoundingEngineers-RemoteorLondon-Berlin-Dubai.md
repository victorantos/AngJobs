<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;engineer</a>

Hello. I’m the founder of Talk Machine, previously founded Citymapper.

We had great success in posting here last time, and hired our mobile team (yes we now have native apps - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;apps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;apps</a>)

Now we’re looking to focus on backend engineers and ML&#x2F;voice specialists.

We’re working on building a consumer voice product &#x2F; platform using AI, driven by the mission to improve human communication.

Our application process is unique. Just go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;engineer</a> and send us a voice note and we can begin talking, just like we met in person.

We’re seed funded and can pay competitively + quality stock options (EMI in UK).

You like: talking, consumer, voice, AI, small fast teams, building great products, chasing product market fit

You can also reach out to me at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;az" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkmachine.com&#x2F;az</a>. :)
