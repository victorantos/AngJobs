Estuary - US-Based &#x2F; Remote - Full-time – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;estuary.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;estuary.dev&#x2F;</a>

Estuary is a VC-backed, post–Series A startup powering right-time data replication and transform — from sub-second CDC replication to terabyte-scale OLAP data flows.

We’re open-source, developer-first, and focused on making data movement radically simpler across both our Platform and Applications layers.

We’re hiring for:

Head of Applications Engineering

Own strategy, people, delivery, and SLOs across our Applications stack (SaaS integrations, transformation UX, AI enablement).

Partner directly with the CTO to shape roadmap, sequencing, and engineering standards.

You’ll build and support a healthy engineering org, improve how we plan and deliver work, strengthen incident response, and step in to code when it helps the team move faster.

Great fit for someone who’s led multi-team groups, grown senior engineers, and shipped complex, data-heavy products.

Senior &amp; Staff Backend Engineers (Integrations)

5+ years backend experience; Go required, Rust a plus. 
Own core systems powering real-time data pipelines. Build complex API&#x2F;database integrations, improve connector frameworks, and tackle deep challenges in performance, reliability, and developer experience.
