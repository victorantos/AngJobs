Our mission is to make authentication and authorization simple and secure for every developer building web and mobile applications. We want devs to stop worrying about auth and focus on building something awesome. We also just acquired a fine-grained authorization company ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusionauth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fusionauth-acquires-permify" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusionauth.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fusionauth-acquires-permify</a> ) and are going to be building in that area as well.

There are a lot of companies in the auth space, but we feel like we have something special:

* a unique deployment model (self-host on-prem or in your cloud or run in our cloud)

* A well designed API first approach; one customer compared our app to petrichor

* a mature product (the code base is nine+ years old and we&#x27;ve found and fixed a lot of the sharp edges around core login use cases; there are plenty more features to add)

* the CTO is the founder and still writes code

* a full featured free-as-in-beer version which makes the sales cycle easier; prospects often come in having prototyped an integration already

Our core software is commercial with a &quot;free as in beer&quot; version. We also open source much of our supporting infrastructure. Technologies and standards that you will work with: Modern Java, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, OAuth, SAML, OIDC.
