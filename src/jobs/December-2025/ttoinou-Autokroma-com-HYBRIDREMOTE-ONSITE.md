Autokroma.com - C &#x2F; GPU &#x2F; AI dev workflows - HYBRID REMOTE-ONSITE - Porto &#x2F; North of Portugal

We do audio video software : video editing plugins, web panels, GPU visual effects, encoders, decoders, AI assisted development &amp; testing. All levels are welcome. You will work close to the code, users requests, whole UX in general, I try to minimize the layers between developers, products and final users. If any of those topics are of interest to you, and you&#x27;re around Porto to meet me : send me an email, the first part of the email is &quot;jobs&quot; and after the @ the domain name. Tell me what you&#x27;re looking for nowadays, a previous bad work experience you&#x27;d like to avoid and a good work experience that inspires you for the future.
