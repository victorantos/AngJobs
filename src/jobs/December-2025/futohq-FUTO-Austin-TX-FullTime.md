FUTO - Austin, TX - On-site &#x2F; Remote - Full Time

FUTO is an organization dedicated to developing, both through in-house engineering and investment, technologies that frustrate centralization and industry consolidation. Our work consists of a combination of in-house engineering projects, targeted investments, generous grants, and multi-media public education efforts. Our principles are here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futo.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;what-is-futo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futo.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;what-is-futo&#x2F;</a>

Machine Learning Engineer - FUTO Keyboard

FUTO Keyboard is a privacy-first software keyboard for Android. Every prediction inference routine runs entirely on-device; no user data can ever leave the device. We support over 150 keyboard layouts and languages, and over 700 layout + language combinations (not all of them include dictionary or predictions)

Swipe typing is an important part of the mobile typing experience for many. Applying machine learning here poses a unique challenge due to the requirement of needing to support so many layouts and languages, as well as user-added personal dictionary words (or even layout customizations!), with limited data. We have previously collected and publicly released a US English QWERTY dataset: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;futo-org&#x2F;swipe.futo.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;futo-org&#x2F;swipe.futo.org&#x2F;</a>

We are looking for a machine-learning researcher or engineer to work through these challenges and help us improve the swipe typing experience in FUTO Keyboard.
