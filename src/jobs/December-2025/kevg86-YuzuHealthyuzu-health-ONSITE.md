Yuzu Health (yuzu.health) - Location: New York City (Flatiron) - ONSITE

Our mission: Rebuild health insurance from the ground up

Why: We&#x27;re solving the root cause of spiraling healthcare costs in the US (we&#x27;re not building an integration on top of United or Aetna)

Investors: We recently raised a $35M Series A. Our investors include General Catalyst, Chemistry VC, Anthropic, Lachy Groom and many unicorn founders, including leaders at Stripe, OpenAI, Brex, Deel, Mercury and Notion

Team: We are reasonable, fun people that work in person in NYC

Roles: See here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yuzu.health&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yuzu.health&#x2F;careers</a> (we have Fullstack and Backend roles posted at the moment. We&#x27;re particularly in need of front end leaning folks right now and would consider other spikes also e.g. a Quant type to work on Pricing and we&#x27;re also open to making a TLM type hire; all roles provide a ton of ownership).
