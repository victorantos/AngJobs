Silkline - Onsite, Seattle (5 days&#x2F;week) - Full-time - Salary+Equity
We need help! and are looking to hire multiple full-stack or frontend engineers at Silkline.

Today, the way modern hardware supply chains work is like fax woke up in 2025 - spreadsheets, email, PDFs, and a lot of sadness. We are fixing this antiquated system and building the AI-first platform to power the future of supply chains. Initially, we are focusing on the rising defense, space, and nuclear sectors.

Over the last year, we have grown considerably (5x&#x27;ed customer count), just announced our Seed round, and brought on some massive logos in the industry. Join me and our deeply customer and product-oriented team, which has been shipping incredibly fast.

Stack: Typescript, React, Next.js, Hasura, Trigger.dev, AWS, Pulumi, Elbow grease
