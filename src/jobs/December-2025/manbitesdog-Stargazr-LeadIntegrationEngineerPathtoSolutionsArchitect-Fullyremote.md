Stargazr - Lead Integration Engineer (Path to Solutions Architect) - Fully remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stargazr.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stargazr.ai</a>

We are a small startup (&lt;10 employees, 3 developers, recently post-revenue) in the analytics and simulation space. We sit on top of ERPs and production systems to provide financial and operational analysis for project-based manufacturing (aircraft, robotics, automotive).

Our stack is Python (Flask and Pandas), Vue 3, PostgreSQL and Clickhouse. Our infra is simple self-contained EC2 machines. We operate with high ownership, letting you impact both technical and strategic decisions.

We are looking for a senior engineer (5-10+ years) to own our integration process. You must have hands-on experience building data ingestion pipelines and ideally a background in technical pre-sales. You will start by shipping these integrations and evolve into a Solutions Architect role as the system and team mature.

To apply, please send your CV and a short background to hn-202512@stargazr.ai
