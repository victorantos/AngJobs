Onlook (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onlook.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onlook.com&#x2F;</a>) - Founding Engineer (Fullstack &#x2F; AI) - San Francisco or REMOTE (US) - Full-time

Onlook is an AI-native visual editor that lets designers, PMS, and engineers collaborate directly in the browser. We launched earlier this year, hit #1 on Hacker News, became the #1 trending repo on GitHub (above DeepSeek + Anthropic), and have grown to 22,000+ stars. We’re now hiring our first Founding Engineer.

We’re a design-led, product-obsessed team backed by YC, and we’re building a next-generation visual IDE used by tens of thousands of designers and engineers.

What we’re looking for:

• Full-stack engineer comfortable owning large, ambiguous problems

• Strong bias toward building fast and shipping often

• High craft, strong opinions, and willingness to defend them

• Desire to build an open-source product in public

• Someone who wants to help shape the culture, architecture, and direction from day one

Tech: Next.js, Tailwind, tRPC, Supabase, Drizzle, Bun, Docker, Anthropic, AI SDK.

What you’ll do:
You’ll work across the stack, contribute to one of the fastest-growing OSS projects ever backed by YC, design and ship core parts of the visual editor, work with 100+ contributors, and help define the product with real users. If you’re in SF, we have a beautiful office near South Park.

How to stand out: Share something you’ve built. A project, repo, or portfolio tells us more than a resume.
