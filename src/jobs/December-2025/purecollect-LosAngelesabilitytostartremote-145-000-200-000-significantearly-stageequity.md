About Pure: Modernizing a Multi-Billion Dollar Market
Started in 2023, Pure is one of the fastest-growing marketplaces for tangible assets. We&#x27;re replacing outdated systems by combining the reliability of traditional trading infrastructure with cutting-edge technology. Our mission is to give collectors and investors the financial infrastructure they deserve.

Why We’re Hiring a Full Stack Engineer:
We need a full stack engineer to lead and own critical features end-to-end, making key technical decisions that define our platform. You will build, maintain, and scale our core backend, including the order matching &#x2F; order-book logic—focusing on concurrency, correctness, and speed. You&#x27;ll work deeply with PostgreSQL (data modeling, query optimization) and build high-quality UI&#x2F;UX using TypeScript + Next.js.

This is a high-ownership role where you will drive the architecture and strategy behind a real-money financial exchange. If you have experience with marketplaces, matching engines, or financial systems, and you thrive on moving fast without sacrificing quality or correctness, you will have immense impact here.

Stack: TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Concurrency&#x2F;Matching Logic
