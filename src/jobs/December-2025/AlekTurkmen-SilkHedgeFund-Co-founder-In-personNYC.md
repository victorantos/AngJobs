Silk Hedge Fund - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silk.fund" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silk.fund</a> - Co-founder - In-person NYC

Silk is a fully autonomous, full stack AI hedge fund that utilizes large language models to orchestrate the complete spectrum of hedge fund operations. We are building a system for truly autonomous wealth generation that replaces traditional investment workflows with infrastructure that enable LLMs not just to interface with financial markets, but to compete with and outperform human investors. Looking to bring on founding members who have technical backgrounds in quantitative finance, ML&#x2F;AI, and risk management.

Hi, I&#x27;m Alek Turkmen, solo founder working on Silk full time now for the past 3 months. Please reach out if interested. Also looking for advisors &#x2F; mentors with finance background.
