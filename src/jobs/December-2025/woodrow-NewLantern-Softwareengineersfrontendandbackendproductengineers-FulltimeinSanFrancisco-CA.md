New Lantern - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newlantern.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newlantern.ai</a> - Software engineers (frontend and backend product engineers) - Full time in San Francisco, CA (ONSITE)

New Lantern is building an AI radiology resident—think Cursor for radiologists. Our application integrates the three software tools radiologists use all day [1], together with AI, to create a platform that saves radiologists toil and lets them focus on reading images and finding disease.

We are a series A startup with ~15 engineers (~25 total staff), have live customers generating revenue, several years of runway, and are backed by Benchmark, Anthropic, and other great investors.

We&#x27;re hiring for several engineering roles. You&#x27;ll work directly with our founder&#x2F;CEO, our staff radiologists, and our end users to build a product that radiologists rely on daily. You&#x27;ll have real ownership and autonomy, and ship meaningful work frequently.

I&#x27;m Steve, New Lantern&#x27;s Head of Engineering. If you&#x27;re interested or want to learn more, shoot me a note at (my HN username)@newlantern.ai.
