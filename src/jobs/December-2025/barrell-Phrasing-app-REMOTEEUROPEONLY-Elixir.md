Phrasing.app - Co-founder &#x2F; Founding Engineer - REMOTE (EUROPE ONLY) - Elixir

Phrasing is a language learning application optimized for learning and maintaining multiple languages, and designed to take you all the way to fluency and beyond. It the professional language learning application for serious learners.

It&#x27;s built with Elixir on the backend, and ClojureScript on the front end. I did try to avoid such an esoteric tech stack, but functional programming and immutable data are just too good.

I&#x27;m looking for someone to come in and take over the Elixir backend for a few main reasons:

1. I long ago hit the limit of what one engineer can do

2. I need to focus on customer facing issues for the foreseeable future, and don&#x27;t want progress to stop on the backend

3. I need someone to collaborate with, if not just to discuss technical details

I&#x27;m trying to do something different with Phrasing, on both a product and a company level. I&#x27;m personally tired of the rampant enshittification of the entire web, and miss the magic of the early internet. I&#x27;m trying to make a massive product, built by a tiny team of people doing the best work of their lives.

I&#x27;ve got a product and some extremely happy (paying users, but this is a very early stage startup. Anyone who joins now would be paid in revenue share (of which there is some) and equity, and should be willing to put in a lot of work and take a fair amount of risk. You need to be passionate about your craft, interested enough in language learning to dogfood the product, and crazy enough to believe you can change the world.

If you&#x27;re interested, please send me a well written email to hn@phrasing.app. Low effort applications will be ignored. The first step of the interview process is a 60 minute interview, so if your application does not make me say &quot;hell yes&quot; then it will likely be rejected.
