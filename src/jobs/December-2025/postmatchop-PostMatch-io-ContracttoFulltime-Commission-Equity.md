PostMatch.io - Growth Hacker&#x2F;Marketing&#x2F;Sales - Remote (USA&#x2F;Canada) - Contract to Fulltime - Commission + Equity

I’ve built a SaaS product with PMF already solved and a clear roadmap. Competitor traction shows there’s plenty of room in the space, and I’m looking for marketers and growth hackers to help secure customers and drive growth.

You’d be a great fit if you:

- Know how to acquire early customers in B2B SaaS
- Thrive on creative, low-cost growth tactics (organic + paid)
- Enjoy working lean and iterating quickly

We’ll need to operate lean in the beginning, but once revenue starts flowing, there will be budget for paid channels and ads to help scale further.

Commission is VERY generous for the short term engagement.

I’m open to trialing potential partners on a commission basis, and if we’re a good fit and see results, I’m ready to discuss a strategic equity partnership or salary.

Let’s connect if you’re excited to help take a business from early traction to serious growth.
