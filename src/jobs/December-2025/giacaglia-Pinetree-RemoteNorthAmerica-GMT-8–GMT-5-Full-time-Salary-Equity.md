Pinetree - Remote (North America, GMT-8–GMT-5) - Full-time - Salary + Equity

We’re hiring our third team member, a full-stack engineer, to work directly with the founders across the Pinetree codebase. If you were here today, you’d be shipping notifications, building out the creator studio with analytics and video management tooling, and improving our Farcaster mini app experience and onchain features like direct payments to creators.

Pinetree is building the best onchain platform for video creators: a crypto-native alternative to ad-driven video platforms that gives creators real ownership over distribution, monetization, and their content. We’re looking for someone highly autonomous who brings solutions to complex problems and wants meaningful product and company ownership.

You should have experience writing and deploying production software in TypeScript, ideally on a small (&lt;50 person) team or other startup environment, and be comfortable working across the stack (React &#x2F; React Native &#x2F; Next.js, Node, Postgres). Crypto or social product experience is a plus.

Stack: TypeScript, React, React Native, Next.js, Node, Postgres

Comp: $120–200k base, 1–4% equity, health&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision, unlimited PTO, remote-first, $2,500 home office budget.
