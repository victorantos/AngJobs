Viam - Staff Software Engineer &amp; Senior Software Engineer, Infrastructure - Onsite 3 days (New York City&#x2F;NYC) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viam.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viam.com&#x2F;</a>

Viam (founded by former co-founder&#x2F;long-time CTO of MongodDB) is an open source robotics + AI developer platform. It is a single platform that brings software engineering maturity to robotics and automation.

Why this could be interesting to you:
Impact: ~100 people (~70 engineers) with only a handful at Staff level → huge room for influence.
Proven, technical founder: → scaling with traction and real customers.
Tech: Backend-focused teams (Core Services, Infrastructure, Motion Planning) using Golang, MongoDB, Linux, GCP.
Timing: Early enough to shape core architecture, late enough to see meaningful usage and scale.
