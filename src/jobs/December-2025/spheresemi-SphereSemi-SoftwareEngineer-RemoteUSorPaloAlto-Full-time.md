Sphere Semi - Software Engineer - Remote (US) or Palo Alto - Full-time

Sphere Semi is applying AI techniques to automate the design of analog and mixed signal chips. Our techniques have been able to achieve state of the art PPA (power performance area) with relatively modest compute. We&#x27;re scaling up and that means we need to rebuild our hardware and simulation pipeline. To that end we&#x27;re hiring a strong software generalist.

We offer competitive salary, meaningful equity, remote-first, unlimited PTO, 401k match, medical&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision.
