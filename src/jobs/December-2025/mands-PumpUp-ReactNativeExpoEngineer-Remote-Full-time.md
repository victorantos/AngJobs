Pump Up - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pumpup.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pumpup.com</a> - React Native (Expo) Engineer - Remote - Full-time

We’re a small, technical founding team in based in SF building an assistant for tradespeople — electricians, plumbers, contractors. Our app turns job site voice notes and photos into structured job records, quotes and invoices. We’re seed-funded, ship fast, and spend a lot of time with users in the field, building practical AI that saves people real hours every week.

We’re hiring a React Native engineer to own big chunks of the product across iOS, Android and Web. You’ll work directly with the founders and take lead on the mobile client. If you like autonomy, fast iteration, and shaping product you’ll fit right in.

Experience with React Native Web, native media pipelines, or AI workflows is a bonus. The role is remote, but some overlap with PST is important. Compensation ranges depending on location.
