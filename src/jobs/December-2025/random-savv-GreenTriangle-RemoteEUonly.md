GreenTriangle - Senior Software Engineer (Product&#x2F;Frontend) - Remote (EU only) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;green-triangle.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;green-triangle.com</a>

We&#x27;re making crop insurance accessible to farmers worldwide. Our platform helps major insurers monitor 10M+ hectares across 10+ countries using satellite imagery and ML — so farmers can manage the volatility of their industry.

You&#x27;ll build web &amp; mobile apps that agronomists use daily in the field (offline-capable, rough conditions), work on data-heavy features cramming gigabytes into mobile apps, and help shape product decisions with real autonomy.

Stack: TypeScript, React&#x2F;React Native, PostgreSQL&#x2F;PostGIS, Python + GDAL&#x2F;NumPy for satellite imagery processing.

Small remote-first team, wear multiple hats. Quarterly in-person meetups.
