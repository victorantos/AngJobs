FanBasis.com - Various Roles (Front-end, Back-end, Full Stack) - Full-Time Miami&#x2F;Remote

FanBasis is building the leading platform for selling digital products, services, and communities — what Shopify was for physical goods, we’re becoming for digital entrepreneurs. Our mission is simple: help creators, experts, and online business owners turn their skills into scalable, revenue-generating digital offers.

We&#x27;re looking for senior full-stack developers with either strong experience with Laravel or with React and NodeJs&#x2F;Tsoa backends. We have an exciting roadmap of new products along with some internal refactoring initiatives.
