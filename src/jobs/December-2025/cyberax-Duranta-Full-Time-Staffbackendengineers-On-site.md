Duranta - Full-Time - Staff backend engineers - Location: Seattle, WA or NYC - On-site

Company: we&#x27;re a small startup (pre Series A) building a business-in-a-box solution for landscaping companies, initially targeting the US. It&#x27;s a huge market with more than 700000 companies in the US alone but with very little good software. We&#x27;re looking for a very experienced backend engineer (senior&#x2F;staff level) capable of taking ownership and leading the development of entire systems.

We keep our infrastructure as simple as possible, so the entire backend is in Golang with Postgres+S3 as the data storage layer. And a bit of Terraform for the infrastructure.

We&#x27;re NOT a standard &quot;AI startup&quot; doing LLM wrappers, but we do have our own computer vision AI that we use to produce models from satellite imagery. So if you&#x27;re interested in working on unusual AI pipelines, we have plenty of work there too.

Our frontend is a React.Native app, and we&#x27;re working towards having full feature-parity inside a regular webapp.

Experience:

* Go backend experience

* A lot of experience with distributed systems

* Designing robust APIs (we&#x27;re using ConnectRPC)

* Ideally experience with offline apps and database synchronization

* The usual: infrastructure-as-code, Docker, Github actions, OpenTelemetry, etc.

Salary: $170-$210k and equity
