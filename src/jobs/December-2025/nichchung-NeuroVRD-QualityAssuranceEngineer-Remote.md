NeuroVRD - Quality Assurance Engineer - Remote - Contractor + Equity
We&#x27;re building the Sentinel AI-IONM system: an AI-driven system that monitors neurovascular integrity in real time during high-risk surgery. This role is for someone who wants genuine ownership of a hybrid hardware&#x2F;software QMS and wants to be close to the regulatory and engineering core of an AI SaMD company.

You&#x27;ll own and operate our Quality Management System across multiple devices (SaMD + hardware) and be directly responsible for FDA&#x2F;ISO-aligned documentation, design controls, supplier quality, clinical-quality support, and software validation oversight. You&#x27;ll work directly with the COO&#x2F;CPO (me), CTO, and our Director of Clinical Research.

Please email Joan at jmeo@neurovrd.com with a resume &amp; cover letter about why this work matters to you.
