GovDash.com - Full Stack Software Engineer - AI Agent Orchestration - Full-Time - New York City - $150K

GovDash is redefining government contracting, a $700B+ market driven by slow, outdated tools. We are building the AI-first ERP that unifies capture, proposal development, and contract management, replacing disconnected point solutions with a unified, intelligent system.

We recently closed a $10M Series A led by Northzone with participation from Y Combinator. This funding validates our approach and fuels our mission: to empower businesses to win contracts and deliver on the government missions that advance American interests.

You will own projects end-to-end, from the Node&#x2F;TypeScript backend coordinating automations to the React&#x2F;Next.js frontend delivering seamless user experiences. You will be the reason contractors can scale their business and better serve the government mission. This is a chance to apply deep technical skill to a massive, untouched industry with a meaningful national impact.
