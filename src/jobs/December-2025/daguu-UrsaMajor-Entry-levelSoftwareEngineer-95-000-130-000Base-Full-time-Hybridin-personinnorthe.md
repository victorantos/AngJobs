Ursa Major - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ursamajor.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ursamajor.com</a> - Entry-level Software Engineer - $95,000 - $130,000 Base - Full-time - Hybrid in-person in northern Colorado, US

Ursa builds propulsion for aerospace and defense, so... rocket engines.

My team works on software and process problems across the company, but we specialize in the data system used by development and test teams. We work on anything from data backhaul, post processing, and anomaly detection to the frontend that lets them plan and manage test campaigns and do data analysis. The data plane is built on the FDAP stack and we have some super interesting work upcoming to integrate some of our data post-processing pipeline with our custom DataFusion UDF library. Overall stack is Rust, Python, Typescript.

Role is hybrid in-person in northern Colorado. Our headquarters is also our manufacturing and test facility, so a super interesting place to spend a couple days a week with amazingly smart and engaged stakeholders. People generally commute from Denver, Boulder, or Fort Collins, all great places to live.

Only open to US citizens or greencard holders due to export laws around rocket engines. I’m the HM so feel free to ping me with any questions. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ursamajor.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ursamajor.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;software-engineer&#x2F;</a>
