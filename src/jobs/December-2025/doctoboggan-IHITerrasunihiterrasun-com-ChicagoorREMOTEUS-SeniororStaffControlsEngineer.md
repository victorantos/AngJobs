IHI Terrasun (ihiterrasun.com) - Chicago or REMOTE (US) - Senior or Staff Controls Engineer

At IHI Terrasun we do design and integration for solar + battery storage projects across the US. We recently finished the largest solar + storage project in the US (Gemini - located outside of Las Vegas). Read more about it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.primergygemini.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.primergygemini.com</a>

We are looking for a controls engineer to join our engineering team. Experience in the battery storage industry is a plus, but not required. Familiarity with HMI development, Ignition, RTAC, Allen Bradley, or SEL control systems and IEC-61131-3 programming language is a plus.

Reach out to me at jminardi at the domain above to learn more or apply.
