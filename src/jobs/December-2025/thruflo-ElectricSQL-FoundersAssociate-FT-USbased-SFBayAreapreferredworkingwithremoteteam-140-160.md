ElectricSQL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com</a> - Founders Associate - FT - US based, SF Bay Area preferred (working with remote team) - $140-160k + equity

Electric is a devtools startup. We solve reactive, real-time sync across client and server [1]. We have a large developer community, millions of downloads a week, high profile customers and top-tier investors. Our software is built into platforms like Firebase, Prisma and TanStack. Our cloud product is growing 7% week on week.

This is a generalist, operational role. Working directly with the founders and founding team [2] to handle company operations as we grow into and through the Series stages.

It would be ideal if you&#x27;re based in the San Francisco Bay Area. If not, you need to be able to travel there every month or so. You also need to travel to Europe for team on-sites a few times a year.
