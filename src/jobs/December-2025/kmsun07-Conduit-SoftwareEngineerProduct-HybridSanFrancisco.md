Conduit - Software Engineer (Product) - Hybrid (San Francisco) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloconduit.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloconduit.com</a>

Conduit is revolutionizing warehouse operations with our modern yard and dock management system. By building a frictionless pickup and delivery experience for warehouses, we empower logistics teams to operate with unparalleled efficiency and visibility. In a sea of point solutions, we differentiate ourselves by offering a modular all-in-one platform that combines workflows to deliver 10x the value to customers. Our mission is to be the “Air Traffic Control” for warehouses, ensuring efficient, fast, and safe operations. We just raised our $6M Seed, have zero churn, hit 172% NRR this year, and are focused on scaling in upper mid-market and enterprise.

As a product-minded software engineer, you&#x27;ll play a critical role in helping grow the company. While your core job is to build great products, you’ll occasionally step outside of product to support go-to-market efforts or customer success — a great opportunity to learn how this massive, critical industry works. We currently have three engineers on staff and are looking for a fourth.

Tech Stack: Python, Django, PostgresQL, GraphQL, TypeScript, Svelte
