Tendavo - Founding Engineer - Stockholm - On-site (Hybrid) - Full-time - Visa - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendavo.se&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendavo.se&#x2F;</a>

Tendavo helps SMEs win public procurement tenders - a massive, neglected market. We are bootstrapped, profitable and have around 100 happy customers without taking a dollar of external investment. We are based at the SSE Business Lab, where companies such as Klarna and Legora originated.

We spent the last year validating PMF. The CTO has built the core foundation, and now we are hiring a Founding Engineer to architect and code the rest of the platform side-by-side.

The Team: CEO: ex-McKinsey - CTO: +13 years of startup experience, previously founded a data startup scraping 50m pages&#x2F;week.

The Role:
You will work side-by-side with the CTO to build the platform from the ground up. You get full technical ownership to design agents and LLM workflows that replace our manual routines.
This is a high-agency role: We have validated Product-Market Fit; your job is to scale it.

Tech: Python (AI &amp; core systems), PostgreSQL, TypeScript, GCP

We offer equity, mentorship from a technical team, and a clear path to VP&#x2F;Head of Engineering.

Reach out to me directly at tom.dickson@tendavo.se - we&#x27;d love to hear from you!
