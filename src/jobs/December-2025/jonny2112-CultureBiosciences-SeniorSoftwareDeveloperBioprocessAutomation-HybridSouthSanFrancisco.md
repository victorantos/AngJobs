Culture Biosciences - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.culturebiosciences.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.culturebiosciences.com</a>
 - Senior Software Developer (Bioprocess Automation) - Hybrid South San Francisco, CA - $180k–$210k + equity

We build cloud-connected bioreactor systems that let biotech companies design, run, and analyze upstream bioprocess experiments faster. You’ll own software that automates and controls bioreactors, instruments, and analyzers, working across the stack from embedded&#x2F;edge control loops (pH, DO, temperature, agitation, feeding strategies) up to cloud-native data and workflow apps.

We’re looking for someone with ~8+ years combined experience in bioprocess&#x2F;automation + software engineering, strong Python and Docker&#x2F;IaC skills, and experience interfacing with physical systems. You’ll collaborate closely with scientists, process engineers, and hardware teams, and mentor other engineers on a small, multidisciplinary team.
