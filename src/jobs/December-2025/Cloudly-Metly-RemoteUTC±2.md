Metly - Founding Engineer &#x2F; AI Engineer - Remote (UTC ±2) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetmetly.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meetmetly.com&#x2F;</a>

Metly is a pre-seed startup (team of 5) building strategic intelligence for pharmaceutical companies. We&#x27;re aiming to replace consultants.
Pharma companies hold critical knowledge across disconnected systems—regulatory filings, clinical pipelines, competitive intelligence—none of it linked to real market activity. We&#x27;re building the layer that connects it all and makes it actionable.

You&#x27;ll be working on the hard parts of getting LLMs to construct knowledge graphs users can actually trust: entity extraction from dense regulatory documents, grounding outputs with verifiable citations, and turning unstructured data into clear recommendations.

Stack: TypeScript&#x2F;Python, React on TanStack, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes on GCP.
We have traction and are moving fast in 2026. Competitive salary and meaningful early-stage equity.
