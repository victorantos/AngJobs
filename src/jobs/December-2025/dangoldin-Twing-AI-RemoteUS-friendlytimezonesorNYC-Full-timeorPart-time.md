Twing.AI - AI&#x2F;Full-Stack Engineer &amp; Forward Deployed Engineer - Remote (US-friendly timezones) or NYC - Full-time or Part-time

We’re a lean (4 people, 3 of which are engineers), bootstrapped team building a private-equity automation platform (deal analysis, document processing, chat, investment theme research). Shipping fast, learning daily, and looking for hands-on engineers who want outsized impact.

- Stack: React Router 7&#x2F;React 19, shadcn&#x2F;Tailwind v4, Node&#x2F;TypeScript (strict), PostgreSQL + Prisma + pgvector, S3; AI workflows with embeddings &amp; LLMs.

- Why join: small team with direct ownership of core product, zero bureaucracy, Greenfield decisions and ability to learn extremely quickly, you’ll ship to paying users weekly.

AI &#x2F; Full-Stack Engineer

- Own features end-to-end: data ingestion → AI pipelines → UI.
- Design and tune LLM&#x2F;embedding flows; keep latency&#x2F;cost in check.
- Requirements: strong TypeScript&#x2F;Node, modern React, SQL + data modeling; comfort evaluating&#x2F;using AI models; bias to ship.

Forward Deployed Engineer

- Work directly with customers (PE analysts&#x2F;partners) to turn messy workflows into productized features.
- Rapidly prototype, measure impact, harden for production.
- Requirements: full-stack chops, great product sense, calm under ambiguity, willing to jump between code, data, and customer calls.

Happy to also talk to the self-taught. We care more about ability than credentials and value slope over intercept.

How to apply: Email jobs@twing.ai with “HN – [Role]” in the subject, a short note on something you’ve shipped, and any links (GitHub&#x2F;portfolio). No recruiters.
