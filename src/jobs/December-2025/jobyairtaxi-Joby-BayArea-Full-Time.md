Joby - Bay Area - Full-Time

Imagine a piloted air taxi that takes off vertically, then quietly carries you and your fellow passengers over the congested city streets below, enabling you to spend more time with the people and places that matter most.

We are looking for an experienced and motivated Mobile&#x2F;Full stack Senior Software to join our Air Taxi Systems team.
Most of our apps are built with SwiftUI, TCA, and GraphQL. Our backend is a mix of Java, Rust, and Swift using Federated GraphQL.
