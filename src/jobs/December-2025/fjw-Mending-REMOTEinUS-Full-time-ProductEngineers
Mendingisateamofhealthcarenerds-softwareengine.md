Mending is a team of healthcare nerds, software engineers, product designers, direct primary care doctors, health insurance experts, and more.

We’re looking for a motivated and impact-oriented Product Engineer to join our small team of 5. Your primary focus will be building data pipelines and backend systems that automate and improve workflows for patients, providers, and internal operations.
