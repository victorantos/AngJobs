YCharts - Software Engineer - Applied AI - Full-Time - REMOTE (US) - 140k - 180k USD + benefits - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycharts.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycharts.com</a>

We&#x27;re an investment research and proposal generation platform that leading RIAs, asset managers, and broker-dealers use to transform complex financial data into clear visuals and actionable insights.

I&#x27;m Carlton, the team lead for applied AI at YCharts. Our team is a full-stack software engineering team with a focus on building features that use frontier LLMs. Think AI agents and workflows that streamline the process of analyzing hypothetical portfolio allocations, building financial charts, screening for funds that match some criteria, and more.

I&#x27;m looking for full-stack software engineers who are excited about AI, but with a discerning view and an ability to cut through the hype around it to build AI features that are actually useful.

Our stack includes FastAPI, Django, Celery, Valkey, Pinecone, MySQL, Angular, and LLMs from OpenAI&#x2F;Anthropic.
