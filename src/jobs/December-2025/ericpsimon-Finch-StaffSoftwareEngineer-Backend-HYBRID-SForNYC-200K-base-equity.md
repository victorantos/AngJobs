Finch - Staff Software Engineer, Backend - HYBRID - SF or NYC - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;finch&#x2F;62ac428a-80ef-4469-9e06-0b87ed4f206f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;finch&#x2F;62ac428a-80ef-4469-9e06-0b87ed4f...</a> - $200K+ base + equity

Finch (tryfinch.com) is building unified API infrastructure for employment systems—think Plaid, but for payroll and HR data. We connect 401k providers, insurance companies, and other fintech apps to 200+ payroll providers through a single integration. Series B backed by General Catalyst, Menlo, YC, and angels including founders from Plaid, Brex, Mercury, and Ramp.

We&#x27;re looking for a Staff Backend Engineer (10+ years) to lead large cross-team initiatives, design systems for high-volume data processing across complex employment integrations, and help set architectural direction. You&#x27;ll work with NodeJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and AWS. We deploy daily, practice TDD, and care deeply about building reliable, scalable APIs. Strong systems design skills and comfort with ambiguity are key—you&#x27;ll be defining problems as much as solving them.

Hybrid (2+ days&#x2F;week in SF or NYC). Equity includes a 10-year exercise window. Full benefits, unlimited PTO with 3-week minimum.
