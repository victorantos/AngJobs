Today, more than 500,000 customers rely on Perpay, and we are driven by this mission that meaningfully improves the financial stability of everyday Americans. We’re in a special moment of building, scaling, and deepening our impact, and are eager to find teammates that want to join us on the journey.

Our venture partners include First Round Capital and L Catterton.

We&#x27;re looking for:

- A few Senior Full-stack or Backend Engineers across our 3 product engineering teams. We highly value product-mindset, experience building production web apps for real users, and ability to coach and support more junior engineers.

- A technically hands-on Engineering Manager. Ideally, you have at least a year or two of experience leading people and being accountable for a team&#x27;s execution, roadmap, and performance. You would be the fourth &quot;line manager&quot; on our team, and so there&#x27;s ample opportunity to grab org-wide initiatives that are interesting and impactful.

Our stack includes AWS, Postgres, Python&#x2F;Django, React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Typescript, Datadog
