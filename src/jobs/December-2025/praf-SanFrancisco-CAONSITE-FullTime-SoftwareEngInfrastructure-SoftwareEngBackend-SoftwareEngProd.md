Column (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;column.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;column.com&#x2F;</a>) - San Francisco, CA (ONSITE) - Full Time - Software Eng (Infrastructure), Software Eng (Backend), Software Eng (Product)

Column is building the infrastructure that powers the US dollar globally. We&#x27;re a software first company, but also own a nationally chartered bank that we&#x27;ve built from the ground up. We&#x27;re currently processing trillions of dollars annually (yes, that&#x27;s with a T), supporting some of the largest and most sophisticated companies out there like Wise, Bilt, Brex, Ramp, Mercury and dozens of others.

Started by the founder of Plaid (plaid.com), Column is focused on keeping an extremely lean and experienced team: currently 10 engineers that all report to the CEO. We are looking for an ambitious infrastructure, product, and backend engineer (one of each) that want to build incredible software from first principles.

Profitable and 100% owned by employees and founders.
