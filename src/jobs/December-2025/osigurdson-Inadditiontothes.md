In addition to the search tools mentioned above, feel free to use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nthesis.ai&#x2F;public&#x2F;hn-who-is-hiring" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nthesis.ai&#x2F;public&#x2F;hn-who-is-hiring</a>. It has search (text &#x2F; semantic), chat and extracts data from alternate viewpoints (e.g. business &#x2F; role) and allows you to visualize a semantic map of those things. I hope it helps!
