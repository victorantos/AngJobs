*Not AI*

At Base we&#x27;re building a distributed fleet of energy storage systems to fix the nation&#x27;s power grid. We build and manufacture power converters, deploy them across the power grid, and build the algs, ingestion and commanding platforms that operate the fleet in response to real-time grid conditions.

Our team is made up of engineers from top infrastructure and energy companies (Apple, Anduril, Starlink, etc) and we recently raised a billion bucks from fancy people (a16z, Valor, Thrive, Addition).

We are looking for: platform, firmware &amp; controls, embedded, and full stack!

Come build cool shit and fix the power grid with us!
