Bidaya AI - Senior Software Engineer (Full Stack) - Calgary, Canada - HYBRID - Full-time - Up to $140k CAD + Generous Equity

We&#x27;re an early-stage (pre-seed) VC-backed startup automating RFP proposals for the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) industry.

We are building an agentic AI platform that embeds directly into Microsoft Word, helping firms find and win more work, while serving as their knowledge management hub for all business development.

You would be the first full-time engineering hire working directly with the founders (I&#x27;m the technical co-founder). We need someone who can ship production code across the whole stack.

The Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js, React
- Backend: FastAPI (Python), Temporal

Hard problems you will solve:

Deep Word Integration: Building a high-performance, &quot;Cursor-like&quot; experience within the constraints of Office.js.

Agentic Workflows: Orchestrating AI agents that can read complex government requirements, reason about compliance, and generate winning output autonomously.

Evolving Knowledge Graph: Architecting a library system that doesn&#x27;t just store files, but learns from project history and feedback loops.

If you want a chance to work on a hard problem, in an exciting space, with a strong team that has validated the market and de-risked the business, with major upside, let&#x27;s talk!
