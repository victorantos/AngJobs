foam.ai - Founding Engineer - $180-$300k - 0.25%-2% - SF (onsite) - Full Time

foam is building a new observability stack that captures, traces, and links everything, purpose-built for AI. We use this foundation to feed complete context into AI to automatically identify and root-cause breakages across entire systems.

* We’re a five person team. Perla (CEO) was the 5th engineer in the consumer facing team at Affirm (pre-IPO).

* We&#x27;ve raised $9.9M in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Max Levchin, The House Fund, and South Park Commons

* We’ve got active betas at Orb, Braintrust, Plaid &amp; TogetherAI.

We’re looking for engineers who want to take point and work hand in hand with Perla on one or more of our core systems:

1. The Telemetry Engine - Think of this as a major extension of OTEL custom built to capture signals that have historically been inaccessible to humans.

2. The Root Cause Analysis Engine (aka Solver) - This is currently an agent swarm, but evolves every week in search of better and better root cause analysis.
