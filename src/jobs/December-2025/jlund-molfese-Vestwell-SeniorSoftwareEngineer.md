Vestwell - Senior Software Engineer - HYBRID - NYC; Austin; King of Prussia, PA - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vestwell.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;7510610003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vestwell.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;7510610003</a> - $145K - $160K base + bonus &amp; equity

I&#x27;m the hiring manager for this role. Please see the job description for details, but I&#x27;m looking for someone who is, or is able to become, proficient in backend development for a public nest.js API suite using TypeScript. We don&#x27;t have any hard requirements like a CS degree or prior nest.js experience, but candidates do have to complete a TypeScript coding challenge. It&#x27;s a real-world problem, no leetcode. In total, our interview process is only 3 rounds, and we move pretty quickly. We also want someone who has systems design experience and good technical leadership skills. You also have to be self-motivated. We use a pull rather than push process, so work isn&#x27;t assigned to people, and you have to be good at working efficiently without many hard deadlines or micromanagement.

Happy to answer any questions here! If you&#x27;d like to apply, please email shane.vierra [at] vestwell [dot] com with your resume.
