Renaissance Philanthropy - Research Engineer &#x2F; MLE &#x2F; Full-stack - Remote (worldwide)

Renaissance Philanthropy&#x27;s aim is to activate a virtuous circle of increasing ambition and impact between philanthropists and innovators: by identifying frontier experts both in science and in new ways of solving problems; by tapping into the growing number of emerging philanthropists; and by building multi-sector initiatives that can harness the power of philanthropy, markets, and governments.

RenPhil&#x27;s Engineering Hub supports mission-driven, grant-funded educational technology projects that seek to improve educational outcomes in fundamental skills like math and reading. The Engineering Hub consists of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and full-stack developers who collaborate with researchers and entrepreneurs to build scalable, measurably effective tools for teachers and students.

We’re looking for folks who:

- can speak the languages of both research and engineering

- are creative problem solvers

- are comfortable with navigating ambiguity

- want to help create a world where all children receive a high-quality education.

If this sounds like you, please apply!
