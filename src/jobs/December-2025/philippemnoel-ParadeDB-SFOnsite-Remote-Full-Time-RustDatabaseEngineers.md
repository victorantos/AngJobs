ParadeDB - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paradedb.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paradedb.com</a> - SF Onsite + Remote - Full-Time - Rust Database Engineers

ParadeDB is an alternative to Elasticsearch built on Postgres. We&#x27;re building a Postgres extension in Rust that offers a new index type optimized for full-text search and aggregate&#x2F;analytics workloads. We solve three problems with Elasticsearch today:

- Lack of read-after-writes guarantees

- Lack of JOINs

- Infrastructure complexity &amp; cost due to syncing Postgres and Elastic.

We&#x27;re open-source, and our repository is available at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paradedb&#x2F;paradedb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paradedb&#x2F;paradedb</a>. We&#x27;re a Series A team of 8 distributed across the US and Canada. Most folks on our team have 10+ years of experience in database internals at companies like Twitter, MongoDB, Oracle, Instacart, etc.

You can find our roles and the profiles of our team members here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paradedb.notion.site" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paradedb.notion.site</a>

If you know Rust and&#x2F;or have experience working on DB internals and want to work on cool systems problems, shoot us a note. We hire with conviction, have lots of room to grow, and exciting technical problems to solve. My email is phil@paradedb.com.
