Abatable (YC S21) — London (Hybrid, 2 days onsite) — Senior Product Engineer — £80,010–£88,900 + stock

Abatable builds the infrastructure that helps organisations source, evaluate, and support high-quality climate and nature projects. We&#x27;re backed by YC, GFC, Blue Bear, and Azora.

We&#x27;re hiring a Senior Product Engineer who ships quickly, thinks deeply about users, and is comfortable owning features end-to-end across the stack. You’ll work on data-heavy, user-facing products that directly enable corporate climate action.

What we value:

Strong product sense and ability to challenge requirements

Great debugging, clear communication, and pragmatic decision-making

Full-stack ability (React&#x2F;TS&#x2F;Remix&#x2F;Postgres), but no specific stack required

Preference for simple, elegant solutions over complexity

Why join:

Mission with real climate impact

High ownership, autonomy, and pace

Transparent, supportive culture with true work–life balance
