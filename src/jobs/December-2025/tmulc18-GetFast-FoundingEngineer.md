GetFast - Founding Engineer - Bay Area &#x2F; Remote

We&#x27;re on a mission to simplify running through wearables data.  We&#x27;re a small team of runners who love to build.

We&#x27;re looking for a founding engineer to shape the future of our product and company. You’ll work across the stack–from building reliable, scalable systems to rapidly prototyping and launching new user-facing features. You’ll have significant ownership and influence on architecture, product direction, and engineering culture.

Ideally you love a few of the following:
 - Foundation ML models in the sensory space
 - Chat agents
 - Novel data visualizations
 - Recommendation systems
 - Operations research
 - Unique UX
