Ditto - Product Designer - Remote (US&#x2F;Canada) - $140-200K + early team member equity

Ditto helps teams manage their copy from design to production with a single source of truth. Over 3,600 teams (from Fortune 500 companies to startups!) currently use Ditto.

We&#x27;re hiring our second product designer to help to define and design our core product, from strategy to execution. As the second designer on our team, you’ll have an outsized impact on defining not only what Ditto is and how it works, but what we do next.

Ditto is a design-driven company. Our design function has high ownership around identifying and shaping problem spaces, exploring solutions, and helping to drive implementation. We don’t have a product function—instead, both design and engineering own the product lens. We think this is critical for Ditto’s product, which used by design and engineering teams in their day-by-day workflows.
