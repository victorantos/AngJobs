Precision - New York City (Optional Remote) - Founder seeking first technical teammate

I’m a solo founder in NYC building Precision — a platform that automates commercial real-estate underwriting and valuation. The proof-of-concept is fully working and has been demoed to institutional CRE professionals with strong feedback. I come from institutional CRE investment banking and have a solid technical foundation (built the entire PoC myself).

I’m looking for a strong engineer interested in joining early to help take the product from proof of concept → production: architecture, database design, scaling, multi-tenant security, and integrating AI for document abstraction.

Stack: React, Node&#x2F;Express, MongoDB (MERN).

If this sounds interesting, reply or email me: kylemarsh49 [at]  gmail [dot] com

Happy to share the demo and discuss what a technical partnership could look like.
