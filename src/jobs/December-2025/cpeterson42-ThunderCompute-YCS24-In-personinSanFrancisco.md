Thunder Compute, YC S24 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thundercompute.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thundercompute.com</a> - In-person in San Francisco

Hiring 4 full-time Software Engineers for low-level C++ systems work (HFT skillset), reporting to the CTO, team ex-Citadel, ex-Aquatic, ex-Bain

We&#x27;re a cloud provider using GPU virtualization software to arbitrage GPU prices.

To our customers, we are a direct substitute for Runpod, Lambda, Coreweave, etc. with a simple UX and low prices.

Our advantage is we have spent 3 years bringing research technology to market which lets us use each GPU more efficiently than competitors. We can buy GPU compute, make it more efficient, and resell it at 60%+ profit margins.

We recently closed ~$4.5M of funding to triple our team size with a focus on recruiting the world&#x27;s best low-level talent.

If you&#x27;re cracked at building C++ systems software, on noncompete and bored, or looking to do something more meaningful than creating liquidity (you can tell most of our team is from HFT), reach out.

To apply: email met at carl@thundercompute.com and mention HN. I read every email.
