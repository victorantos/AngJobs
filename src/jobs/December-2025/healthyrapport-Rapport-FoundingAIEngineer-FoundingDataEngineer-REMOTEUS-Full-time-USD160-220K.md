Rapport - Founding AI Engineer + Founding Data Engineer - REMOTE (US) - Full-time - USD$160-220K+

Rapport is fixing healthcare&#x27;s broken payment infrastructure. Hospitals lose billions annually to opaque payer rules and outdated contracts. We&#x27;re an AI driven platform that ingests contracts, claims, and policies at scale, transforming them into real-time pricing intelligence to help get providers paid what they deserve.

We are backed by top tier investors and already have one of the largest RCM operators in the country as our development partner. Founded by a healthcare tech veteran with two prior exits. This is a chance to be a true founding team member with meaningful equity and direct impact on product and company direction.

Role 1: Founding AI Engineer – Claims Pricing Intelligence Build production pricing engines that transform messy healthcare data into accurate claim prices. Think of it like playing a complex game: interpret intricate payer rules, combine them into working logic, and validate at scale. Design data pipelines for PDFs&#x2F;CSVs&#x2F;APIs, create business logic combining rules based systems with ML validation, and build explainable systems where every decision is traceable. Thanks to our partnership, you&#x27;ll work with massive real world datasets from day one. Stack: Python, SQL, FastAPI, LLMs and Agentic frameworks.

Role 2: Founding Data Engineer Architect our data platform from scratch. Build fault tolerant pipelines using Databricks that handle diverse sources, design normalization layers for healthcare data, and implement observability for production reliability. First data hire, you&#x27;ll shape our entire data strategy. Stack: Python, SQL, Databricks, Azure&#x2F;AWS, Airflow&#x2F;Prefect.

Rapport is a remote only company with quarterly in person sessions. Significant equity + competitive compensation.
