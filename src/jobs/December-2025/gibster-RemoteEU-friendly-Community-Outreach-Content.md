Hiring: MouseMux - Remote (EU-friendly) - Part-time (8-16h&#x2F;week) - Community + Outreach + Content

I’m the solo developer behind MouseMux (mousemux.com) - a Windows tool that enables multiple users &#x2F; multiple cursors on one desktop (local + remote). It’s used in trading &#x2F; multi-monitor setups, simulator &amp; control-room (SCADA-ish) environments, classrooms, and other collaborative workflows. MouseMux is at a turning point: a wave of major new functionality is landing, especially around remote multi-user collaboration. The product is becoming significantly more capable, and I need someone who can translate that to the world - clearly and genuinely, in the niches where it shines. You’ll be the “spider in the web”:

* Talk to existing customers, capture use cases, keep relationships warm * Create simple content (short screen-recorded videos, posts, case snippets) * Find look-alike companies&#x2F;institutions and do human, non-spammy outreach * Coordinate with relevant creators (YouTube&#x2F;bloggers) for deep-dives * Occasionally post in relevant communities (Reddit&#x2F;Discord&#x2F;forums) transparently and helpfully 
No coding required, but you should be comfortable with technical users and Windows tooling. I’m optimizing for someone autonomous who can run with outreach + content.

Comp: contract, €60–€120&#x2F;hour depending on fit, 8–16h&#x2F;week. Start with a small paid test project. Bonus possible for meaningful outcomes (pilots&#x2F;case studies&#x2F;revenue growth).

Email: info@mousemux.com with (1) short intro, (2) 1–2 examples of content&#x2F;outreach, (3) why MouseMux.
