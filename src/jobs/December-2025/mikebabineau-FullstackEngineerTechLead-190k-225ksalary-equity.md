Turnstile (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turnstile.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turnstile.ai</a>) - REMOTE (US&#x2F;Canada) - Fullstack Engineer (Tech Lead)- $190k-225k salary + equity

---

We&#x27;re a small (23-person) team of repeat founders and seasoned operators building a next-gen quote-to-cash platform. This is a tight-knit and senior crew — most of us have 10-25 years&#x27; experience, much of it together. The last company we built, Second Measure (YC S15), scaled to 70+ people and tens of millions in revenue, and was ultimately acquired by Bloomberg in a landmark deal.

We&#x27;ve built a category-defining product and are now gearing up to scale. We&#x27;re looking for a Tech Lead with early-stage startup experience to help architect our platform and mentor a small team of talented engineers.

We&#x27;re well-funded by top investors (First Round) and just raised our Series A, are fully distributed, and recognized for building intentional, inclusive culture. We offer competitive global rates (SF salary + equity), equal pay by level, and comprehensive, family-friendly benefits.

I&#x27;m Mike, one of the founders— if interested, apply here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;turnstile" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;turnstile</a>) mention this post.
