Kulipa - Backend Engineer - London - ONSITE

We issue Visa &amp; Mastercard cards not backed by a bank. Instead we use stablecoins held in non custodial wallets.

This type of service is crucial for many people in places like Argentina, Colombia, Nigeria, Turkey, where inflation soars and sheltering in foreign currency is hard and often impossible.

Down the line, we want to take card payment settlement time down from days to minutes, which will remove a huge and expensive inefficiency in the card scheme.

We are headed by an ex-Mastercard, Google, Meta, and Binance team. Still very small: 5 people on the engineering team. We intend to continue growing small and senior. Our current team is skewed heavily towards senior with two former L7s from Meta&#x2F;Google.

We have raised a seed early this year and are seconds from going live with first cards.

Looking for senior, passionate engineers in London.
