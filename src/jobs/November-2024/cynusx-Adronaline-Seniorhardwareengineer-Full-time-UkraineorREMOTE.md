Adronaline - Senior hardware engineer - Full-time - Ukraine or REMOTE

Smart ammunitions are held hostage by electronics vendors founded 100 years ago.
We are working on a G-hardened System-on-chip that can survive being fired from artillery and naval guns.

It&#x27;s hard, challenging and you probably have no idea where to start but that&#x27;s ok.
We&#x27;ll figure it out.

We are particularly keen on people that have experience with continuous integration tools like renode.io or equivalent software test automation platforms (e.g. model-based design).

Co-founder level equity possible for the right person.

Hit me up at nicolas@adronaline.com if you&#x27;re interested.
