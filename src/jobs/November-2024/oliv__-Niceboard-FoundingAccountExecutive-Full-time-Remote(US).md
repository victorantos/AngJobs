Niceboard - Founding Account Executive - Full-time - Remote (US) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;niceboard.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;niceboard.co</a>

Niceboard is a founder-led, profitable &amp; bootstrapped B2B SaaS startup. We are the preferred job board software for hundreds of organizations (associations&#x2F;non-profits&#x2F;staffing companies etc...) running white-label job boards. We&#x27;ve paid out over $2MM in job post earnings to our customers and helped thousands of candidates find jobs and hundreds of employers hire great talent.

I&#x27;m looking for a founding Account Executive who will own the entire sales process from prospecting to closing. Ideally, you:
* genuinely enjoy sales, talking to leads and customers and closing deals
* are hands on, can move fast and work independently
* want to acquire tons of closing experience
* want to sell a great product (our customers LOVE Niceboard and some of them earn 6 figures with it —aka product pays for itself)
* are interested in working directly with me (the founder), helping take Niceboard to the next level and participating in the company&#x27;s growth
* are hyper focused on performance
