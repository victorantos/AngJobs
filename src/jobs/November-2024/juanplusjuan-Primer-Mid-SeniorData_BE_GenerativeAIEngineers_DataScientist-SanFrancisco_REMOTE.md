Primer - Mid-Senior Data, BE, Generative AI Engineers, Data Scientist - San Francisco, REMOTE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sayprimer.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sayprimer.com</a>

At Primer, we are reimagining the answers to the age-old question of how to grow your B2B business in a world of AI.  Unlike AI-enabled sales tools that are focused on the individual lead, Primer is focused on the macro view of marketers and helping them to execute their strategies.  It requires terabytes of high quality, proprietary data and we have some of the best of it.  Commoditization of ELT architectures and AI has opened the door for us to tackle difficult, combinatorial optimization problems that marketing leaders are attempting to answer every day.  Making these answers digestible and accessible to non-engineers using novel technology is our goal.

About me: I&#x27;m an experienced Y-Combinator founder and engineering leader. My teams have built everything from machine learning systems that crunch 200+ billion data points &#x2F; day at Wheelhouse to groundbreaking 3D&#x2F;CV technology at Modsy that resulted in a patent. We value raw talent, drive, and passion for the problem above anything else the job description says.
