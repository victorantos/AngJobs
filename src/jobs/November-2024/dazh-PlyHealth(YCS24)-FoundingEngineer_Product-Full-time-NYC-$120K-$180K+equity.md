Ply Health (YC S24) - Founding Engineer, Product - Full-time - NYC - $120K-$180K + equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plyhealth.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plyhealth.com&#x2F;</a>

We use AI to help healthcare providers enroll with insurance networks so they can start billing. We&#x27;ve been growing quickly and are almost at the point of turning away customers because we don&#x27;t have enough engineering capacity to service them. We&#x27;re looking for our second engineer who will focus on customer-facing product features to help wrangle the frustrating and complex world of healthcare administration.

This person will have a hand in all of our core systems, interact closely with our customers and their pain points, and work with an ex-FAANG, ex-YC engineering team.

This role is on-site only in NYC.
