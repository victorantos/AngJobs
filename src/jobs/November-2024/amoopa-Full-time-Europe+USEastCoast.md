#1 open-source ecommerce project on GitHub; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;medusajs&#x2F;medusa">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;medusajs&#x2F;medusa</a>

We are building the worldâ€™s most flexible commerce platform. Built for developers with a focus on strong commerce primitives and a framework for customization.

We are a small seed-funded ($8M) team of 18 people looking for key hires who want to work closely with our founding team to build our future cloud platform for companies to host their Medusa project (think Vercel for commerce).

We are looking for engineers motivated to tackle complex problems and who care about crafting great products for developers.
