Checkatrade - Staff Engineer - Hybrid, UK - checkatrade.com

If you’re in the UK, you’ve probably heard our jingle or received a directory in the post. We’re a platform for finding thoroughly vetted tradespeople. (Sort of like Angie’s List in the states, but different monetisation model.)
We’re hiring for a couple of software engineering positions including a Staff Engineer in the Monetisation team (backfilling me).

This team’s backend is pretty .NET heavy but the rest of the stack is PERN. If you’re building a new service, you can take your pick. (Other roles are mostly just PERN stack.)

The company has been around for a while but with our new leadership we’ve really leaned into digitising an otherwise offline industry. It’s pretty fun.

The staff eng role: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.checkatrade.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;2473&#x2F;staff-engineer-monetisation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.checkatrade.com&#x2F;vacancies&#x2F;2473&#x2F;staff-engineer-...</a> (click around for other roles)
