MTA (think trains and buses) - Full-time - NYC - 3x&#x2F;week in office
We&#x27;re hiring two frontend engineers. We&#x27;re a big Typescript&#x2F;React (or React Native) shop and also very big on Mapbox and geospatial.

Our team is responsible for all realtime signs in the subway, two customer-facing apps, the website and the processing systems that transform raw data into actionable information for passengers. We&#x27;re a team of 20, mostly engineers, a few PMs and a product designer. We operate like a startup within the MTA and we move fast!
