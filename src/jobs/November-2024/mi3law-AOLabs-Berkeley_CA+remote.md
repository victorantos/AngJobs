AO Labs - Applied scientists&#x2F;researchers &amp; various roles - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aolabs.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aolabs.ai&#x2F;</a> - Berkeley, CA + remote

AO Labs is building a more reliable alternative to deep learning and LLMs using continuously trainable, compute-efficient weightless neural networks. We are building AI that can learn after training.

We&#x27;re a community of developers and researchers building general intelligence from the bottom-up and we are making space for collaborators at all levels --hackers, contributors, the curious (some of whom we’ve hired already). Get in touch: ali at aolabs.ai and I’ll share some demos.

With our framework we increase training efficiency and also combine the static pre-trained intelligence from LLMs with continuous training to learn local contexts. AI progress is bottlenecked by backpropagation, which necessitates a human in the loop to set the ground truth while also leaving a gap between training and inference that result in increasingly larger, more homogenizing models.

* If you reached out to our previous post here, please email me again and we’ll get back to you first. Our situation has changed some as a startup hence the delayed response.
