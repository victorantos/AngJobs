On the technical side, you will interface with our data stack of Airbyte, Snowflake, dbt, Prefect, Python, Tableau and SageMaker (among others). On the business side, you will work with our sales, marketing, operations, product and finance teams to drive top-line growth metrics (e.g. sales, usage, conversion).

The base salary range for this role is $150,000 to $190,000 (plus equity options and bonus). Employees in this role will work in the office four days, with the flexibility to work remotely on Friday.
