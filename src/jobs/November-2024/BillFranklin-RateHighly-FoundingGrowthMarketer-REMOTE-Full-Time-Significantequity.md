RateHighly - Founding Growth Marketer - REMOTE - Full-Time - Significant equity

RateHighly (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ratehighly.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ratehighly.com</a>) is a marketing tool for B2B SaaS. We’re profitable and started charging customers 4 months ago.

It’s fully bootstrapped so far. I’m a developer and built it myself. I’m looking for a growth marketer with a track record to come on board and focus on marketing.

This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to design and execute a marketing strategy from square one.

To apply please email me (Bill) at bill@ratehighly.com with the subject “Growth marketer” with some details about why you’d be a good fit. The interview process will be two video calls with me.

If you apply I guarantee you’ll get a personal reply - not a form response with no feedback.
