Perceptive Space - Machine Learning Scientist - REMOTE (Canada or USA) - Full-time - Canadian &#x2F; US Permanent Residency or Citizenship REQUIRED* - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perceptivespace.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perceptivespace.com&#x2F;</a>

Perceptive Space is on a mission to make humanity resilient to Space Weather. Space weather has wide ranging impacts - from disrupting power grids here on Earth to destroying satellites thousands of miles away. Current space weather predictions are limited in accuracy and do not provide the decision intelligence required to support the scale of the modern aerospace industry. This results in operational losses like premature satellite deorbit, failed launches, GPS outages, etc.

We are a pre-seed stage deep tech company, with a small but growing team of passionate engineers and scientists that have come together to enable sustained human and technological presence in space and on other planets, while also securing our terrestrial technology from space weather. We are funded by investors who have funded some of the biggest Space, AI and Tech companies today such as SpaceX, Astranis, Anthropic, DeepMind, Tailscale.
