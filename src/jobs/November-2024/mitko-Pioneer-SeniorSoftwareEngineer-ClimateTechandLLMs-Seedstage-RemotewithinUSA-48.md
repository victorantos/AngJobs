About: Pioneer&#x27;s mission is to coordinate the funding for rapid decarbonization. We take the pain out of the government grants application process by using dozens of LLM workflows to reduce the effort required to apply and win government awards, and we’ve helped companies win $160M to date. We have more demand than we can serve, and we’re growing revenue.

Culture: Our core values are kindness, impact, intentionality, initiative, feedback and efficiency in that order, and we implement these throughout our processes.

You: Enjoy the 0-to-1, hungry for growth, actively collaborate and pair with users, can handle the nondeterminism of LLMs, start sentences with *“What if…“*, enjoy building across the full stack.

Stack: We use TypeScript, React, Next.JS, LangSmith and other modern tools.
