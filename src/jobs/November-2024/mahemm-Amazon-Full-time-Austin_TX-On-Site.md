Amazon - Full-time - Security Engineering&#x2F;Management - Austin, TX - On-Site

I am hiring a new Application Security team in Austin to focus on making the highest-privilege applications in the non-AWS side of the company the planet&#x27;s most secure.

This team will be joining a 9-month old effort to collaborate with developers of key apps on security assessment, architecture improvement, design and code review, and automation of the security process.

The pros of our team are technical excellence, a culture of sustainable work (we are working hard here, but strictly 9-5), the opportunity to have a significant influence on the security posture of the company as a whole, and the chance to hack on applications operating at a global scale, and low (1x&#x2F;month) oncall expectations.

The cons of our team are moderate process debt (arising from our newness and some unexpected demand)and higher-than-normal ambiguity in tasks (we hold too many task definitions&#x2F;bars in our head and haven&#x27;t written them down yet).

Please apply to these roles through the links below:
