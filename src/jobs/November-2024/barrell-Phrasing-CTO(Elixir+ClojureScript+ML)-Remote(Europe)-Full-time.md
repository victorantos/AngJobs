Phrasing - CTO (Elixir + ClojureScript + ML) - Remote (Europe) - Full-time

Hi there  Ben and Niko here, founders of Phrasing, an application that can actually help you learn a new language. We&#x27;re an engineering &amp; design duo looking for another technical person to join the project.

To be honest, we&#x27;ve been working on the project for many months now, and somehow continuously wake up every day more excited than the last. Phrasing seems to land in the sweet spot between a market ripe for innovation, an innovative technology catering directly to that market, and an awesome product area to work in.

We&#x27;ve got a working product, paying users, and unlimited potential.

To us, working on Phrasing is the dream. So naturally, there must be other people out there who would feel the same.

As we scale from our initial users to our initial millions, we&#x27;re looking for a technical person to join in a co-founding capacity.

We can&#x27;t offer you a competitive salary (yet), and it&#x27;s too early in the company to be able to promise any semblance of a work life balance.

But if you consider yourself an engineering maverick, have a passion for languages, and a penchant for building - then find out more at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app&#x2F;dream-team" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app&#x2F;dream-team</a>

Backend: Elixir, Phoenix, Broadway, FLAME, Nx, Scholar
Frontend: ClojureScript, Reagent, Local-First, RTC, Single Page Application, Sync Engine
Persistence: Postgres. All the things.
