San Francisco Compute - Multiple Roles - San Francisco - ONSITE

We&#x27;re building a new, regulated, commodity market for large scale GPU clusters. More like the Kalshi, less like craigslist. To accomplish this, we make a VM orchestrator called &quot;Fog&quot; that understands InfiniBand, GPUs, and heterogeneous hardware setups.

We make money by taking a flat fee of a few cents per GPU hour upon delivery. Up until recently, we&#x27;ve been &quot;running a market&quot; via a spreadsheet, by selling bursts on very large clusters (think 6 to 8 figures deal sizes).

SFC started because Alex (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alexgajewski.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alexgajewski.org&#x2F;</a>) &amp; I went to go train an audio model and none of the vendors at the time would sell us a month-long contract. So we bought a year-long one, and tried to sublease it at cost (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36933603">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36933603</a>), so that way we could buy just one month.

The goal of the company is the same: we want to make it possible to buy a big, giant training cluster for a short time period. We think a liquid market will let you spend $40m for a month instead of $300m for a year. If we can&#x27;t make that happen, then only the big labs will get to make AI.

Most of our code is in rust, some typescript. We&#x27;re about ~20 people. We raised $12m a bit ago. There are 7 ex-founders on the team.

We&#x27;d love to work with you! I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;re cool.
