Yarn (YC W24) - Founding Software Engineer - NYC INSITE - Full-time - 160 - 200k + 1-2%

We&#x27;re building a new LLM-supercharged video product, backed by General Catalyst (Stripe, Snap, AirBnb) and angels from Roblox, Meta, and Pika Labs.

Just hit in inflection point with growth and need help ASAP. You&#x27;d be FTE #1.

Weâ€™re all experienced developers, ex-Cambridge, ex-Uber etc. and we&#x27;re looking for ambitious, experienced engineers who want to own products, have a founder mindset with strong equity, invent some cool shit that doesn&#x27;t exist, and build the technical foundations of a $1bn+ company.
