Queueco - HFT - London, UK - Full time on-site - Visa sponsor

We are a proprietary trading firm operating in conventional as well as cutting-edge alternative markets. Our strategies run 24&#x2F;7 without manual intervention powered by low-latency infrastructure and the latest machine learning techniques. We&#x27;re a meritocratic and lean team of highly-motivated scientists and developers and as such value technical ability more than politics: what matters is how good your code is, not how well you sell yourself. We spend no time dealing with clients, customers or investors and instead focus on growing our business by building better technology.

If you are a talented developer who likes to work on low latency systems please get in touch. We are also happy to sponsor exceptional talent.

You will be part of a small development team that shares the responsibility of the whole trading stack. As you own the code, deployment and all tooling, you can rapidly and safely iterate on changes to the trading software. As a result we deploy many times a day.

Developers collaborate directly with traders and researchers, allowing for immediate reaction to market changes and fast iteration of live trading engines
