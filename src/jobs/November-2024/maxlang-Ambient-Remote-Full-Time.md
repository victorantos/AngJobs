Ambient - Remote - Full-Time - Blockchain Engineers, AI&#x2F;ML Engineers&#x2F;Researchers, Rust Developers

Ambient is developing a new blockchain with deep AI integration. We&#x27;re implementing verified inference using a novel proof of work approach, ensuring the integrity of AI inference as different models respond uniquely to the same input.

Our long-term goal is to facilitate training and fine-tuning of models on the blockchain. We aim to provide an alternative to the current AI landscape dominated by a few large corporations, fostering a more transparent and inclusive approach to AI.

Looking for: 
- Blockchain Engineers (currently we&#x27;re inspired by Solana, ideally you have rust experience) 
- AI&#x2F;ML Engineers&#x2F;Researchers (especially if you&#x27;ve worked with distributed training) 
- Rust Developers (especially if you have experience with large distributed systems)
