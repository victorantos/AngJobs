Comulate - Senior Engineer (3+ YoE) - ONSITE in San Francisco, CA We&#x27;re building automation software for the insurance industry, accelerated by AI. Our product has caused customers to literally cry tears of joy. Seed stage in terms of headcount (&lt; 20 people) but Series B in terms of business traction (+ cash-flow positive). Experienced, high-caliber, eng team from Airbnb, Asana, Brex, AWS, and LiveRamp. Building a product-focused eng culture in which engineers work directly with customers. Stack is full-stack TypeScript, Postgres, React, GraphQL, and Next.js.
We&#x27;re intentionally under the radar - we focus instead on delivering for customers and building a category-defining company.
