Sitch App - NYC-area - Full-time - Python + Flutter

Sitch is a new type of concierge dating app. We&#x27;re using AI + Humans to ask you questions, get to know you, then help you find love. We&#x27;re a concierge matchmaker but we don&#x27;t call ourselves that and we don&#x27;t charge the obscene prices that matchmakers charge.

One of our metrics is how little time you spend in the app. We&#x27;re explicitly opposed to the dopamine-fueled mini-game doomswiping of &#x27;traditional&#x27; dating apps which cynically monetizes desperation.

* We&#x27;re top-tier VC funded, small team of 2 cofounders (Snap, Bumble) and 3 engineers, based in NYC.

* Stack is Django, OpenAI, Flutter.

* Looking more for a backend engineer but if you&#x27;re an all-arounder and can also work on client code (or want to learn) that would be ideal.

* 2 days&#x2F;week in person, in Brooklyn, and the rest remote is our ideal working environment, so we&#x27;re strongly preferring the NYC area.
