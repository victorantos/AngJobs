Milieu is helping people grow their network and build meaningful connections in the work-from-home era. We match professionals together based on preferences and goals to meet over lunch at nice restaurants in their city. There are three types of clubs: milieu club (a full-service concierge lunch club including payments, transportation to lunch, etc), city clubs (casual networking lunches), and private clubs (organize lunch for your own network)
