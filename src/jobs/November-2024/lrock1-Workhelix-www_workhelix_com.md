At Workhelix, our ambition is to lead the new category of Business Transformation Management (BTM), helping organizations adopt technologies like Generative AI. We offer two SaaS products: one for planning GenAI initiatives using workforce data, and another for monitoring ROI with advanced research methodologies. We have pioneered a task-scoring method to identify top GenAI opportunities, ensuring clear, data-driven deployment strategies. Our ROI monitoring suite applies cutting-edge economics to provide accurate, ongoing insights into the impact of GenAI implementations. Renowned AI and Economics thinkers including Andrew Ng, and cofounders Andy McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson stand proudly behind our mission.

Our team is 8 full-time employees and growing quickly. Our stack is mostly Python, PostgreSQL &amp; AWS.

We are looking for several roles:

---&gt; A tech lead who can provide leadership and technical oversight for a (growing!) team of engineers.

---&gt; A few software engineers with a focus on platform integrations using GraphQL.

---&gt; A data scientist (preferably with an Econ&#x2F;Stats PhD) with a strong background in causal inference tools and techniques.

---&gt; A customer success engineer who can help us onboard new customers and work with existing customers to do things like help solve data issues and transform customer data into a useable format.  Must have some data&#x2F;technical background (SQL, Python experience).

---&gt; A few Enterprises Account Executives with experience selling SaaS products to c-suite executives. Ideally looking for someone who has helped take a startup from seed to Series A and beyond.
