Gravwell - Go developer - REMOTE (US) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gravwell.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gravwell.io&#x2F;</a>

Gravwell is a Splunk competitor, a data aggregation and analysis platform that can ingest hundreds of terabytes a day with ease. Our product is offered both on-prem and as a hosted cloud service. It&#x27;s written from the ground up in Go, with many open-source components.

We&#x27;re looking for a skilled Go developer who&#x27;s done more than just REST APIs (although that&#x27;s *part* of the job). A well-qualified candidate should be deeply familiar with Linux at the syscall level, have some understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of various filesystems, and be well-versed in networking. If you know your way around &#x2F;proc, if you&#x27;ve got horror stories about EBS performance, if you remember and mourn Go netchans, send us your resume. This is not an AI position, but experience in traditional machine learning and&#x2F;or LLMs is a bonus.

The company is fully distributed, so don&#x27;t worry about any RTO mandate -- we don&#x27;t have an office. Travel for developers is minimal. Developers are periodically scheduled for second-tier on-call support.
