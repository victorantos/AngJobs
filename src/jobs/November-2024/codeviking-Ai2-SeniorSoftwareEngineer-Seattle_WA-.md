Ai2 - Senior Software Engineer - Seattle, WA - ONSITE &#x2F; HYBRID -

Ai2 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allenai.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allenai.org</a>) is a Seattle based non-profit AI research institute founded in 2014 by the late Paul Allen. We pursue foundational AI research and innovation to deliver real-world impact through large-scale open models, data, robotics, conservation, and beyond.

My team is a group of software engineers redefining how researchers and engineers use state of the art GPU clusters. We own and actively develop Beaker, a GPU-first job orchestration system used by Ai2 researchers to manage and execute frontier research workloads, such as large-scale, distributed pre-training and online reinforcement learning. We’re also responsible for Ai2’s on-premise GPU servers from the bare-metal up, operating a high performance storage cluster and designing and developing critical systems that teams across the institute rely on for pushing forward cutting-edge, open science.

We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our team. You should be proficient in Go and Python and have prior experience operating and configuring linux servers in a professional setting.
