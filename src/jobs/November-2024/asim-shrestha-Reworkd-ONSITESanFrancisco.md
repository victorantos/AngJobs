Reworkd - Backend &#x2F; Infrastructure - ONSITE San Francisco

At <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reworkd.ai&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reworkd.ai&#x2F;</a>, we&#x27;re building application layer LLM agents to extract web data at scale. We are foundational data infrastructure for startups today that are fine tuning models or building some web data constrained product. We&#x27;re backed by YC, Paul Graham, AI grant, and many others.

We&#x27;re looking for backend&#x2F;infrastructure&#x2F;full stack engineers to:
1. Help optimize our queue&#x2F;browser infrastructure to enable ingesting millions of pages a day
2. Build Playwright systems to handle two way syncing between users and cloud browsers
3. Work on the UI&#x2F;UX to enable user &lt;&gt; LLM interaction for code generation

If any of this sounds interesting, email me: asim (at) reworkd (dot) ai or apply directly at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;reworkd&#x2F;jobs">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;reworkd&#x2F;jobs</a>
