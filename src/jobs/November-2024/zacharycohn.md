Role: Senior Software Engineer

Company: Tomorrow, a pre-seed, stealth, next-gen kitchen appliance company

Location: Seattle, WA (full time ON-SITE - Lower Queen Anne)

Comp: Competitive compensation and equity package for very early stage startups.

Company background:
A small team - 4 people - working on fusing some novel food storage science with some cool hardware and software to offer a physical product that is truly a step-function better than any of the other devices in its category. The company is about two years old - most of that time spent in R&amp;D but we&#x27;ve recently shifted gears towards productizing said research. We are currently self-funded by our CEO, who previously founded a local Seattle unicorn, but do expect to raise venture funding.

This role:
In the short term, this role will be focused primarily on iterating on the UX of our PWA prototype, building our production mobile app in React Native, adapting our existing infrastructure as we scale into alpha and beta, and building out the on-device experience. We are looking for someone who is excited to work iteratively, and is just as happy tweaking margin spacing as they are building new APIs and managing data transfer between edge devices and our servers. You&#x27;ll have significant ownership over our technical stack and direction, and many opportunities to explore and learn new technologies.

Technologies we&#x27;re currently using:
We do not expect candidates to be an expert in, or even familiar with, every technology on this list - just to be interested in learning the ones they aren&#x27;t familiar with (although we are prioritizing candidates with deep experience in technologies with an asterisk):
- React Native*
- Node*
- Preact
- Kubernetes&#x2F;Helm
- Docker
- AWS
- Python
- Terraform
- Working with LLMs

To apply, please email me (zachary@edesia.ai) your LinkedIn and a few sentences about you and your background.
