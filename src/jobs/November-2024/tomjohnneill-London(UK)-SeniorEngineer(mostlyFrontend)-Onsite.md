Plinth (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plinth.org.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plinth.org.uk&#x2F;</a>) - London (UK) - Senior Engineer (mostly Frontend) - Onsite

At plinth, we&#x27;ve built a software&#x2F;AI platform for charities to help them measure their impact and get more funding for the work they&#x27;re doing. We work with both charities and funders (e.g. foundations, Government), providing a way to easily collect, visualise and report on client and impact data.

We&#x27;re looking for an engineer with experience with React, NextJS etc, who wants to spend almost all their time heads down writing code, and not spending time in meetings.

To apply, try our puzzle: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plinth.org.uk&#x2F;puzzle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plinth.org.uk&#x2F;puzzle</a>
