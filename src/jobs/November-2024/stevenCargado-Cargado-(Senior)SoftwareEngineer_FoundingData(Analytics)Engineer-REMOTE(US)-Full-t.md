Cargado - (Senior) Software Engineer, Founding Data (Analytics) Engineer - REMOTE (US) - Full-time

What do we do?

- Cargado is an early stage technology startup revolutionizing how U.S.-Mexico cross-border logistics is executed. So far, we’ve focused on helping brokers with freight find the carriers best suited to haul that freight.

Why are we going to 100x?

- The TAM here is massive. Mexico has recently taken over the #1 spot as the United States’ leading trading partner. Laredo, TX is the number one port in the United States importing and exporting everything we need and use everyday. We’re going after that with an incredible team that brings a unique blend of tech experience (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) and freight experience (Convoy, Coyoted, Flexport, and more). Just check out our founders, Matt (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;mattpsilver&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;mattpsilver&#x2F;</a>) and Rylan (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;rylanhawkins&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;rylanhawkins&#x2F;</a>).

Freight seems boring though. Why would I want to build software with Cargado?

- This is an industry starved for technological innovation. We’re solving problems that have never been solved before and have the opportunity to create massive impact for individuals and the world at large, since any efficiency gain can be huge when you’re talking about driving around an empty tractor trailer at 8 mpg. Additionally, we’re committed to building world-class technology and invest in learning, dev ex, and planning&#x2F;design to make that happen.

Sure, but it takes money to make money. How will you survive long enough to change the world?

- We’ve raised nearly $10M in venture capital so far (from Ironspring, Primary, Zenda, Wischoff, and more), and before even hitting 1 year we’ve achieved strong revenue from a customer base of over 100 brokers. Taken together, that means we have a diversified source of income in addition to a strong balance sheet.

Our tech stack includes: Typescript, React, NextJS, PostgreSQL, AWS
