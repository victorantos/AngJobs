Fay Nutrition - Lead Android Engineer - REMOTE, San Francisco, NYC - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faynutrition.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faynutrition.com</a>

We have a dream position for someone who wants to lead development of a nascent Android app:

<pre><code>    A built-in user base of tens of thousands of people who are eager to switch from the web experience to the native mobile experience
    A mobile product roadmap with years of advanced and exciting features to build
    A mission of delivering high quality, convenient and affordable care
</code></pre>
We have a v1 app on the Play Store today, and it’s just the very beginning of what we envision for our mobile experience: A one-stop hub for healthy eating where you can chat with your licensed dietitian one day and order groceries covered by insurance the next. To get there, the Android app needs a full-time owner to carry it forward.

Who are we looking for? A talented and driven Android engineer who has built sophisticated Android apps written in Kotlin and relishes the fast pace of a startup environment like ours.

What will you be working with? Our Android app uses Kotlin coroutines, Android Fragments and an MVVM architecture and makes extensive use of Retrofit, Okhttp and Glide libraries. Fay’s core web tech stack consists of a Python backend, a React frontend and a Postgres database.

What You&#x27;ll Be Doing:

<pre><code>    Building: You’ll be adding new features and functionality to the app at high velocity
    Collaborating: You’ll be doing a lot of work with our uber-talented designer, our amazing product manager and our all-star engineering team
    Owning: As the lead Android engineer, you’ll be the one making sure the app has a rock solid technical foundation and a delightful user experience
</code></pre>
The best companies are made of the best people. There’s no shortage of work ahead, but we stay balanced and look forward to celebrating our wins as a team.
