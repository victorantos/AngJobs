2 Software Engineering roles - Full Time - Hybrid (1 day) or Remote - El Segundo or anywhere in USA - US Only (Clearance)

I have 2 open roles on my engineering team supporting the Space Force as a contractor at ManTech. One is for a cloud&#x2F;infrastructure&#x2F;data engineer to manage our cloud enclave(s) and one is for a sysadmin in tools like Jira&#x2F;Confluence&#x2F;Foundry. Our team (~20) is 75% distributed across USA fully remote and 25% in the office one day a week. Both roles require 7+ years experience, and a Secret or Top Secret SCI security clearance (not required to start). $110K-$185K depending on experience and location.

Iâ€™m trying to fix the job posting to correctly reflect some of the info above, so if you see a discrepancy, go with this post.
