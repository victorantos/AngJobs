Graphistry, Louie.AI - Full stack, security AI evangelist, devrel, growth marketing - REMOTE GLOBAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com&#x2F;careers</a>

The Graphistry GPU-accelerated visual graph AI platform is used by data-intensive investigation &amp; analytics teams around the world. Think top gov, bank, enterprise, &amp; tech teams tackling cyber, misinfo, fraud, supply chain, clickstreams, etc. Louie.AI is our expansion to making investigations even easier via generative AI UX and real-time AI KG with technologies like real-time graph RAG that continuously monitor external &amp; internal data and turns low-code playbooks into neural ones.

With original investors like Nvidia and Bloomberg, we are now multiplying year-over-year purely on revenue and looking for key ownership roles. Our team spun out of UC Berkeley to help invent key technologies like what are now called Apache Arrow and Nvidia RAPIDS, and data teams are now in positions to use them and are looking for help from platforms like ours. There is a lot to do!

1. Security AI evangelist &amp; growth marketing: We are looking for our first marketer with high ownership responsibilities around our community, technical content, growth initiatives, and collaborating with the top AI technology platform companies &amp; security teams globally. You might be a security practitioner interested in the AI x security equivalent of DevRel, or a security-experienced growth marketer. You&#x27;ll get to learn, collaborate, &amp; share with the community around key uses of graph, genAI, &amp; GPUs for tough problems.

2. Full-stack engineer. Complementing Louie.AI&#x27;s current self-hosted version, we are looking for a fullstack engineer to help drive our SaaS launch&#x27;s multitenancy scaling work around vertical&#x2F;horizontal&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;k8s, and expanding its general genAI capabilities (backend integration, graph RAG, app features, ...).

See graphistry.com&#x2F;careers for each opportunity &amp; its link to an expanded description . We are actively growing to meet customer need, so it is an exciting time!
