Personio - Engineering - Full-Time - NYC (hybrid 2-3 days)

We&#x27;re one of Europe&#x27;s largest Unicorns that provides an all-in-one solution for HR, and we&#x27;ve recently expanded our tech presence to the US, with an office conveniently located across the street from Moynihan Train Hall in NYC.

As part of a larger initiative to establish a solid technical foundation for growth to IPO and beyond, I recently joined to build out a platform to provide reliable, scalable, and governed access to all of the data used by our products.

If you have a passion for building software platforms, thrive in ambiguity, and are interested in taking projects from ideation to operation, then you could be a Staff Engineer that I&#x27;m looking for to join my org:
