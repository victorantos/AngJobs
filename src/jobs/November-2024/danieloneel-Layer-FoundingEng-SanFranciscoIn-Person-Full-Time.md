Layer - Founding Eng - San Francisco In-Person - Full-Time

We’re building SMB accounting software API-first so that it can be integrated directly into software platforms where business owners already work. Our customers are vertical software platforms in the vein of Toast, MindBody or Housecall Pro that help small business owners start, run and scale their business with workflows and financial products. We help them serve their customers who are stuck exporting all their data out of these systems into CSVs and importing it back into other accounting software.

Integrating with our accounting APIs gives business owners automation &amp; accounting workflows directly within their core software while the software platforms get to solve one their customers’ biggest pain points: worrying about bookkeeping &amp; finances.

We’re looking for a founding frontend engineer who is excited about building a company and team as well as building better software for SMBs. We have no standalone frontend - instead we build a React component library that our customers can directly use within their own apps: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;@layerfi&#x2F;components" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;@layerfi&#x2F;components</a>

We are well funded by top tier investors and are live with thousands of small businesses across a dozen industries. If you’re passionate about building software that real small businesses use every day, get in touch with me at daniel [at] layerfi.com
