Column (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;column.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;column.com&#x2F;</a>) - Software Eng (Infrastructure), Software Eng (Backend), Software Eng (Product) - San Francisco, CA (ONSITE) - Full Time

Column is the first nationally chartered bank built from the ground up for developers. We provide an API first, modern banking experience for our customers, replacing the bloated middleware and legacy software that currently powers most financial companies.

Started by the co-founder of Plaid, Column has a team of &lt;10 experienced engineers and is currently processing hundreds of billions in payments annually, supporting some of the largest and most sophisticated fintech companies. We are looking for ambitious infrastructure, product, and backend engineers that want to build the best-in-class banking tech from first principles. It&#x27;s a fun time to join - we are scaling volume crazy fast while shipping tons of new features. To keep the team small we have a very high bar for talent, but if this sounds exciting would encourage you to apply!
