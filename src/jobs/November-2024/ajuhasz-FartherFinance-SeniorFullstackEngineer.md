Farther Finance - Senior Fullstack Engineer - REMOTE (US) &#x2F; HYBRID (NYC Residents) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;farther.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;farther.com</a>

We&#x27;re a Wealth Management platform and advisory firm (RIA) that helps high-net-worth individuals and families achieve their financial goals. We&#x27;re looking for a Senior Typescript Fullstack Engineer (over-weighted towards the backend) to join our Client and Advisor Product team. We just raised our Series C and you&#x27;ll be joining a team of 5 other CAP engineers. We focus on lean teams that lean on functional programming to move fast and still act like a Series A company.

You&#x27;ll be working on a full-typescript codebase and be responsible for designing features from a blank sheet, coming up with normalized relational tables, and writing functional (imagine TS code that looks like Haskell) backend and frontend code. Some more details: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fartherfinance.notion.site&#x2F;Senior-Typescript-Full-stack-CAP-Engineer-131d5585fd768042bef3ed4424304114" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fartherfinance.notion.site&#x2F;Senior-Typescript-Full-st...</a>

Experience in finance&#x2F;fintech is a must. If your experience is in the wealth management space or trading that is a huge plus. As this is in the senior range we&#x27;re looking for 7+ years of experience or some kick-ass equivalent.

Please contact adam+nov-hn@farther.com with a copy of your resume and a brief introduction. As we&#x27;re a detail oriented team please include a sentence or two on your favorite functional programming idiom, yes this is my brown M&amp;M test.
