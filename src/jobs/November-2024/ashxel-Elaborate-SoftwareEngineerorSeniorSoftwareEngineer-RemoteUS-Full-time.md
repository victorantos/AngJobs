Elaborate - Software Engineer or Senior Software Engineer - Remote US - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elaborate.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elaborate.com</a>

Elaborate is a clinical intelligence platform designed to reduce physician burnout by automating inbasket tasks. We streamline workflows for lab result management, clinician review, routing processing, and care coordinationâ€”freeing clinicians from time-consuming administrative work.

I&#x27;m looking to hire someone who has demonstrated success as an engineer for an early-stage startup and who is excited to tackle messy problems in the healthcare space by building safely but quickly. Full-stack fluency is preferred, but the bulk of our work consists of backend challenges--two-way EMR integrations, clinical data processing pipelines, etc.

Tech stack buzzwords - Python, TypeScript, SQL, Postgres, Redis, NextJS, AWS, Docker, Terraform
