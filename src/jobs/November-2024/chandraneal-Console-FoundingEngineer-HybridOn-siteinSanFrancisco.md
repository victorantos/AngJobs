Console - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.console.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.console.co</a> - Founding Engineer - Hybrid On-site in San Francisco

Console gives IT teams trainable AI agents that can handle support requests directly in Slack, without needing a human-in-the-loop. Today, Console can automate 40-70% of the work that a tier 1 IT support agent would otherwise have to do, including things like: managing app access, password&#x2F;MFA resets, laptop troubleshooting, IT policy Q&amp;A, onboarding&#x2F;offboarding, and more.

Weâ€™re a small team of founders and founding engineers looking to add a couple more key team members who want to get hands on building and scaling an applied AI product in a space that is ripe with opportunity.
