OCCRP - Senior Frontend Developer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.occrp.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.occrp.org</a> - Full Time - REMOTE (UTC +0 to +4)

We&#x27;re working on a new implementation of Aleph[1], a tool to index and link research material for investigative journalism. The goal is to give investigative journalists an effective and user-friendly &quot;big data&quot; type tool to deal with mountains of documents.

Part of that is building a new frontend from the ground up, first to improve the existing features, and then to develop new features.

We&#x27;re not looking for a specific tech stack, but rather the right person to build a good foundation. You can &quot;bring your own tech stack&quot; – anything reasonably mainstream-y is fine.

- Should have reasonable experience with the core of the selected tech stack. This is a small team with some deadlines, without a lot of room for experimentation with the latest greatest JavaScript thingy.

- We want &quot;boring tech&quot;[2] that will still work in five years.

- Reasonable dependency tree; in the dozens, not hundreds and certainly not thousands. It&#x27;s not a crime to write 50 lines of code yourself if that saves adding a whole bunch of dependencies.

- Good developer experience: changes should show up in hundreds of milliseconds, not seconds. Any competent developer should be able to start working on it with a relatively short lead time.

The initial focus will mainly be on re-implementing the existing frontend, after which the focus will shift to new features.

You will be working with a UX designer and we&#x27;re not looking for a UX expert, but you should have familiarity with good UX design. You will be joining a team of three backend developers, a UX design researcher, and a product manager. Everyone works fully remote.

While this is primarily a frontend position, willingness to learn at least some Go basics would be good (it&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t know Go).

HOW TO APPLY

Please email martin.tournoij@occrp.org with a resume and a brief description of your proposed tech stack and why you think it meets the requirements. This doesn&#x27;t need to be very detailed – 2 to 4 paragraphs is enough. As mentioned, pretty much $any tech stack is fine – we&#x27;re fairly open about this. Please *do* write this.

I&#x27;ll respond to everyone. Turn-around time should be about ~2 weeks at the most.
