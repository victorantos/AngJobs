SPREAD - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spread.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spread.ai&#x2F;</a> - Technical writer &amp; support - Germany (Berlin, ideally) - Full-time

SPREAD builds B2B software for mechatronics customers like cars and defense systems. We help them design, build and diagnose problems with their systems faster. We do it with a combination of a well-designed ontology we&#x27;ve spent years working on as well as AI-based systems. Right now, we&#x27;re looking for a technical writer and also someone to start our support organization.

Candidates *must* be in Germany already, though specific location within the country doesn&#x27;t matter that much
