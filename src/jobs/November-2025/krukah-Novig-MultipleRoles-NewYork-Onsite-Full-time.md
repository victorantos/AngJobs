Novig - Multiple Roles - New York - Onsite - Full-time

Novig is rebuilding sports betting from first principles as a prediction market exchange. Legacy sportsbooks are extractive middlemen with misaligned incentives, dark patterns, and predatory mechanics. We&#x27;re creating the alternative: a transparent exchange where users trade against each other at fair odds.

We&#x27;re building core infrastructure around order routing, risk management, data pipelines, low-latency networking, and market integrity at scale. We write Rust extensively. We believe correctness, performance, and expressive code are necessities rather than luxuries. Ideal candidates care deeply about infrastructure, security, and performance. It certainly won&#x27;t hurt to also care about prediction markets, traditional markets, or well-designed distributed systems.

Tech stack: Rust, Node, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Linux, distributed systems.
