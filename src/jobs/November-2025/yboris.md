Is *4DWW* not a tag we want to normalize?

Whoever posts this post monthly, could you please include the text after `REMOTE` referring to *Four Day Work Week*?

I know not many employers are currently offering it, but we&#x27;re talking about a comma and four letters added to the text - not much of a cost to anyone.
