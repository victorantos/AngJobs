Silk Hedge Fund - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silk.fund" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silk.fund</a> - Co-founder - In-person NYC

Silk is a fully autonomous, full stack AI hedge fund that utilizes large language models to orchestrate the complete spectrum of hedge fund operations—from quantitative research and technical analysis to trade execution, position management, and portfolio oversight. Silk is being designed to support several hundred autarkic cloud-based LLM instances that can each perform their own real time market analysis and trade stocks on a custom recurrence schedule, with custom MCP tools and infrastructure, using initial conditions (configurable strategies) set by humans. The end state for Silk is a multi-prop hedge fund that invests in financial markets with zero humans in the loop.

I&#x27;m currently a solo founder working on this full time (2 months). Please reach out if interested. Also looking for advisors &#x2F; mentors.
