P-1 AI - Super SWE; Forward Deployed Engineer - SF or REMOTE (US&#x2F;Canada) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p-1.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p-1.ai</a>

P-1 is building an engineering AGI for the physical world. Our first product is Archie—an AI engineer capable of quantitative and spatial reasoning over physical product domains at the level of an entry-level design engineer. We aim to put an Archie on every engineering team at every industrial company on earth. $23M seed led by Radical Ventures.

Super SWE - Full-stack generalist heavyweight. You&#x27;ve done something remarkable, go 0→1 before breakfast, and have built exceptional UIs. Architecture, front-end, back-end, infrastructure—the full gamut. High talent bar, mission-driven team. Remote (US&#x2F;Canada) or SF-based; remote folks spend 1 week&#x2F;6 in SF office.

Forward Deployed Engineer - Own customer deployments end-to-end. Build production AI solutions, integrate Archie into customer workflows, fine-tune models with customer data. Python + production AI experience required. Bonus: physical engineering background (aerospace, mechanical, etc.) or experience with safety-critical systems.
