Trinsic - Software Engineer - REMOTE (North America) - Full‑time

We’re building the first Identity Acceptance Network—the “Visa for ID.” Humanity is editing genes, starting space tourism and working on artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, identity verification is still done by taking pictures of plastic cards . We’re bringing identity into this new age, where trust  is essential and becoming more so every day with AI. We enable accepting digital IDs that users already have (mDLs, BankIDs, reusable IDs) and verify users ~10x faster across 40+ networks covering 500M+ people.
