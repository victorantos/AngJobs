Happy Scribe - Product Engineers (Growth &amp; Staff) - Onsite &amp; Hybrid (Barcelona, Spain) - Full-time

Hi there, Happy Scribe founder here. We built one of the web’s most accurate multilingual transcription platforms with 0$ vc money, trusted by hundreds of thousands of users each month.

Now we’re taking that same tech and expertise to a bigger frontier: turning conversations into intelligence. We’re building the layer where meetings become memory, ideas become action, and teams work with more clarity and speed.

You’d be joining a team of ~20 people, close-knit and pragmatic. Some of us are scaling a mature, revenue-generating platform. Others are prototyping new products that push the limits of speech and agentic AI.

We move fast but think long-term. There’s room here to own, shape, and ship real products — not pitch decks. We hire only builders and kind people :)
