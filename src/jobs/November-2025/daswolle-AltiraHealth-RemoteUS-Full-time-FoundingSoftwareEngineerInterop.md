Altira Health - Remote (US) - Full-time - Founding Software Engineer (Interop) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.altirahealth.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.altirahealth.com&#x2F;</a>
We&#x27;re building an AI care platform to reduce ER visits, close care gaps, and guide patients to the right care at the right time. We&#x27;re a pre-seed healthcare startup working with major providers to drive real outcomes. We have great runway, we&#x27;re moving fast, and we have lots of leads that mean we can&#x27;t build fast enough. We also believe in compliance and security from day 0.

We&#x27;re looking for someone with deep healthcare integration experience to hit the ground running. Ideally they&#x27;re a pragmatic backend expert to help us scale as we continue to grow. Integrations can be a full time role, but at a startup it&#x27;s necessary to wear many hats. So this individual should also feel comfortable as a generalist who can jump in at any part of the stack.

Stack: Python, Django, GraphQL, AWS, TypeScript, React, Terragrunt&#x2F;OpenTofu

Ideal: early-stage experience, deep experience in healthcare integrations, thrives solving problems

Fair compensation + equity
