Railway - Product Design, Customer Success Engineer, Product Eng (full stack)- REMOTE (Worldwide) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;Railway?utm_source=DayMzWzJ0P" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;Railway?utm_source=DayMzWzJ0P</a>

Tired of trying to beat kube into shape? Does writing YAML to ship code fill you with utter dread? Dream of a future where deploying software is simple, and you don&#x27;t need an army of infrastructure engineers to build that perfect janky bash script™ to make life easy?

We&#x27;re Railway, and we think infrastructure can be better. So far we&#x27;ve built out a platform loved by hundreds of thousands of users who simply tell us &quot;Give me Postgres&quot;, &quot;Deploy this repo&quot;, and we make it happen

Fair warning! The problems are complex: home-rolled hypervisors, cut-above container orchestration, over&#x2F;under&#x2F;whateverlay networks, virtio device drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn&#x27;t suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build it and we&#x27;re looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun.
