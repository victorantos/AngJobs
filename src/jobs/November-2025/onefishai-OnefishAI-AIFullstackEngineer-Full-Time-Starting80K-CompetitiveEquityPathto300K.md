Onefish AI is building a revolutionary offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) to deliver AI consulting to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
We are disrupting the AI consulting market by providing robust, game-like AI tools that are 100% functional offline, boosting efficiency and cutting waste for real-world businesses. Our unique hybrid architecture combines browser-based Python execution (Pyodide) with intelligent cloud routing to empower businesses where connectivity is a challenge.
We are looking for a Founding AI Fullstack Engineer to own and build this core hybrid architecture from the ground up. This is a rare blend of:
Cutting-edge R&amp;D (multi-agent AI systems, browser ML)
Advanced Engineering (offline PWAs, Pyodide, Go&#x2F;FastAPI routing)
Direct Business Impact (building solutions that solve immediate SME problems)
The ideal candidate will be an expert in Python (specifically for single-source browser + cloud runtimes) and have deep experience with Svelte, Pyodide, FastAPI, Go, PostgreSQL, and Docker. You will be responsible for everything from PWA Service Worker architecture and data synchronization to multi-agent LLM design and model optimization for offline performance.
If you are a builder energized by creating a highly complex and unique tech stack to solve a massive market need, we want to talk to you. This role offers the Lead Engineer → CTO trajectory.
