Fusionbox - Python + TypeScript Engineers - United States- Full-time - REMOTE (Legal to work in the US)

We&#x27;re a software engineering consultancy that builds enterprise software the right way. We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we&#x27;re invested in the ecosystem we build on.

We&#x27;re looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond &quot;SELECT *...&quot;), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you&#x27;ll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn&#x27;t enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks.

We&#x27;re a small team where you&#x27;ll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You&#x27;ll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance. If you&#x27;ve ever wished your job involved more elegant state machines and fewer marketing landing pages, let&#x27;s talk: info@fusionbox.com.
