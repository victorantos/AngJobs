I’m a Backend Software Engineer with 4 years of experience building and scaling distributed systems. I’ve led the design and development of Spark Streaming and Kafka-based services, optimized data pipelines, and integrated observability systems like Splunk for multi-tenant architectures.

I enjoy solving large-scale systems challenges, mentoring engineers, and driving backend reliability and performance improvements. I’m currently looking for roles focused on distributed systems, platform engineering, or backend architecture.
