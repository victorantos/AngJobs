DN Institute - Software Engineer - Full Remote (World)

Distributed Networks Institute’s mission is to achieve sustainable technological growth and resilience by leveraging scientific, engineering, and organizational principles of distributed networks. We are a part of a 501(c)3 non-profit incubator in Washington DC called BlockShop.

We just released a paid Software Development challenge with a monetary bounty and a chance to become part of our team. It involves improving a Telegram Connector, deployed on Cloudflare Workers (JS + Python). You can find the full description and more information about challenge program in the Github issue here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;1712n&#x2F;dn-institute&#x2F;issues&#x2F;491" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;1712n&#x2F;dn-institute&#x2F;issues&#x2F;491</a>
