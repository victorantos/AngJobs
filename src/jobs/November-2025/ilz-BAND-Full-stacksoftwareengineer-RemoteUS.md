Band powers trade agreements and incentives for the businesses that supply everything around us, improving how distributors and manufacturers transact trillions annually.

Led by the team that founded and built Blue Apron to a $2B IPO and built Bread Payments, Band has already tripled revenue this year and is looking to add our third full-stack engineer, reporting to the CEO.

Hard problems you’ll solve:

- Building AI to understand and optimize complex trade agreements with nuanced tiered incentives

- Interpreting massive amounts of transactional data across businesses to build a single source of truth

- Providing actionable automated insights to stem profit loss and grow our customers’ businesses.
