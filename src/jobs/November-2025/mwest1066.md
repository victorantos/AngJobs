PrairieLearn (Remote US) — Full-Stack Software Engineer — TypeScript &#x2F; Node &#x2F; Postgres &#x2F; AI

PrairieLearn (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prairielearn.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prairielearn.com</a>) is an open-source assessment platform originally developed at the University of Illinois and now used by universities across the US (Berkeley, Princeton, Michigan, UIUC, and others). We power mastery-based learning, interactive question generators, and large-scale exams.

We’re a small, profitable, early-stage company (bootstrapped, no VC) and we’re hiring a full-stack engineer to help us continue to grow. You’ll work across the stack and have meaningful ownership from day one.

We’re also developing AI tooling in the product:

* LLM-based agents to help instructors create and test new question generators

* Vision-language models for grading student-submitted work (e.g., math derivations, diagrams, sketches)

This is practical, user-facing AI work with real-world impact — not a research sandbox.

Tech we use:

* Node.js &#x2F; TypeScript backend, Postgres, AWS, React

* PrairieLearn is open core: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PrairieLearn&#x2F;PrairieLearn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PrairieLearn&#x2F;PrairieLearn</a>

You might be a fit if you:

* Have experience with full-stack web development (TypeScript &#x2F; Python &#x2F; SQL &#x2F; HTML&#x2F;CSS)

* Enjoy working directly with users (many are instructors and TAs)

* Want to own features end-to-end, from idea to rollout

* Are excited about building practical AI integrations, not just demos

Details:

* Location: Remote (US only)

* Salary: $100k+ depending on experience

* Benefits: Stock options, unlimited PTO, flexible hours

* Role: Full-time. (We’re not able to sponsor visas at this time.)
