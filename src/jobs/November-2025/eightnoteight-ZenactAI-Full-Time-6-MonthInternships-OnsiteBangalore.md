At Zenact AI, we are building AI agents that test apps like real users. I personally faced this problem at Zomato for over 6 years while handling many bugs and incidents.

Backed by the Zomato mafia.

Team comes with deep expertise from Zomato’s scale journey.

## Roles:

* Founding Engineers.

* Interns (6 months). Must’ve built serious projects or freelanced early in college.

## Tech Stack:

Golang, Python, Java(5%), Appium, AWS, Docker

## You’ll work on:

* Building the platform from the active feedback from the customers, with heavy focus on improving the end to end latency of testing.

* Fine-tuned vision &amp; reasoning models (currently 92% accuracy vs SOTA ~60%)

* AI agents for mobile testing, reasoning flows.
