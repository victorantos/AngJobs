EQTY Lab - Software Engineers (Fullstack &#x2F; AI ), or DevRel - SF, LA (looking for local, but wfh if cool) - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eqtylab.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eqtylab.io&#x2F;</a>

We are hiring software engineer(s) to help innovate on applied agentic applications and governance&#x2F;alignment at runtime.

Specifically, you will help us release and further enhance <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eqtylab&#x2F;cupcake" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eqtylab&#x2F;cupcake</a> - a solution derived from our Claude Code feature request for hooks. We believe hooking into the agent harnesses will be critical for scaled adoption; ambitions for purely LLM-driven trusted behavior exist today- but we must empower those responsible for run-time with deterministic guarantees. We do so by hooking into the harnesses - Claude Code, and now supported by Cursor, soon Gemini CLI. Beyond coding agents, we look to apply this to web harness agents, whether it&#x27;s LangChain, Google ADK, etc.

We are looking for an engineer, or devrel equiv, that can:

<pre><code>  - help develop across the full stack from an integration perspective (build the supporting bindings and SDK abstractions for web-based frameworks)

  - create quality demonstrations&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;advocacy

  - continue to advance on the forefront of agentic security as well as better performance for agents.
</code></pre>
Competitive salary and equity.
