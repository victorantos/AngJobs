Elicit - San Francisco + remote (US timezones) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elicit.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elicit.com&#x2F;careers</a>

Elicit is building AI for science. We scaled to &gt;$7MM annual revenue and 450k MAU fast. We&#x27;re hiring for multiple roles and are primarily interested in people with early-stage company experience, who are comfortable in high-agency, fast-paced teams.

Reasons you might want to join Elicit:

1. We have been thinking about how to apply AI for high-stakes knowledge work since even before GPT-1. Elicit was spun-out from Ought (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ought.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ought.org&#x2F;</a>) which was an applied research lab.

2. If you&#x27;re concerned about the potential downsides and risks of super-powerful AI: so are we! Happy to explain more of this story on a call, or you can also check e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ought.org&#x2F;updates&#x2F;2022-04-06-process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ought.org&#x2F;updates&#x2F;2022-04-06-process</a> for a primer.

3. We like spending time with each other, and have get-togethers every 6 weeks, but we&#x27;re flexible on location.

Reasons you might not want to join Elicit:

1. We&#x27;ve found a level of product market fit (as evidenced by metrics) but we&#x27;ve not proven everything out yet. If you want predictability, Elicit is not for you.

2. We aim to hire people who thrive in low-bureaucracy environments, and let them loose. If you need structure, lots of support, close mentorship, or tightly-defined work assignments, Elicit is not for you.
