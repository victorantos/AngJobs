We&#x27;re a GPU cloud building software to use GPUs more efficiently.

To our customers, we are a direct substitute for Runpod, Lambda, Coreweave, etc. with a simpler UX and lower prices.

Our advantage is software - we have spent 3 years bringing research technology to market which lets us use each GPU more efficiently than competitors. At the same time, our software focus lets us provide a high-quality, industry-leading UX.

In a space where customers shop around and try several providers, having a better product at lower prices has let us quickly expand.

We recently closed ~$4.5M of funding to triple our team size and continue building best-in-class software.

If you&#x27;re cracked at building C++ systems software (most of our team came from HFT) or kubernetes infrastructure, reach out.
