SpruceID (YC W21) - REMOTE (US-Based Preferred) - Full-Time - spruceid.com

Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Instead of users logging into platforms, we believe platforms should request to access data vaults controlled by users.

The demand for trusted digital ID is accelerating as AI deepfakes begin to destroy most of the ways we use to verify identity today. How private or secure is it to hold your driver&#x27;s license or passport up to a webcam to get a bank account? Was it ever private or secure? Stable diffusion can break so much of this already. Society will need trusted digital IDs and credentials. Our mission is to allow them to be controlled by individuals, with safeguards to prevent descents into surveillance states and checkpoint societies.

We are the main implementers of category-defining initiatives such as the digital ID program for the California DMV, and the verifiable digital credentials program in Utah. We are private sector participants in NIST&#x27;s National Cyber Security of Excellence initiative for privacy-preserving digital ID.

Today, we are hiring highly capable engineers who care about making a real impact in improving public services, digital autonomy, and user privacy for the world. We work closely with public sector agencies, and everyone on our team has a high regard for those in the public service. We have a strong engineering culture. We are not a SaaS product or AI wrapper, and our roles are not for the faint of heart. You will be expected to work hard and learn a lot in this role.

Our engineers are incredibly ambitious. On any given day, they may write great Rust&#x2F;C#&#x2F;TypeScript, deal with mainframe dumps, read policy documents, respond to technical RFIs&#x2F;RFPs, manage on-prem environments, implement new NFC + Bluetooth protocols in Swift&#x2F;Kotlin, create CI&#x2F;CD processes that enforce W3C accessibility guidelines and i18n requirements, rewrite lost specs from disassembled binaries, figure out stablecoin payments, and design new protections for public key infrastructure. It is a team effort, and people with T-shirt shaped skills are able to collaborate and learn a ton from each other every day.

The potential impact of this work cannot be understated, and this is not the right job for you if you want to &quot;join a cool new AI startup&quot; and make a fast exit. However, if you care about our mission, then you will have the opportunity to make meaningful outcomes for society that will make you feel proud.
