FigureTwo - Founding Engineer (Full Stack) - Full-time - Remote (US)

FigureTwo is reimagining scholarly figures — turning static charts into accessible, interactive, and data-linked visuals that power reproducibility and open discovery.

We&#x27;re founders from the scholarly publishing industry (Springer Nature, American Chemical Society, and Research Square) building the next generation of tools for researchers to create and publish beautiful, transparent, and FAIR-compliant scholarly figures.

What you’ll do:
 - Lead technical development and architecture for the core product
 - Build end-to-end features (TypeScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Vega)
 - Integrate AI&#x2F;ML components (e.g. LLMs for chart suggestions, data extraction)
 - Collaborate closely with design &amp; product founders on strategy and roadmap
