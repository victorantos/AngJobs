LiveMap - Geospatial Data&#x2F;Backend and Mobile Engineers - Full-Time - Switzerland or Remote (CH, EU, UK)

Visa sponsorship is not provided.

LiveMap is a funded startup with a vision to build the next generation of mapping apps (think hyper-personalised Google Maps). How that looks is still being explored so we&#x27;re building prototypes, getting them into customer hands and iterating quickly. We&#x27;re looking to bring on a couple of people to help accelerate this development process.

As a data engineer you&#x27;ll set up a data pipeline, work with product to identify relevant datasets, connect, persist and expose that data.

As a mobile engineer you&#x27;ll be the UI delivering value to the customer. We are testing hypothesis in weeks and leveraging tools like Claude Code to do it.
