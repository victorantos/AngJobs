Pelairo Inc. - Principal Engineer &#x2F; Tech Lead - REMOTE (US) - Full-time

At Pelairo we&#x27;re building the most intuitive and flexible Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) on the market. &quot;Manage the lab, not the LIMS!&quot;

We&#x27;re looking for a hands-on Principal Engineer to lead the design and delivery of our backend—built on TypeScript + NestJS—and help our small team iterate quickly with confidence. You&#x27;ll turn ambiguity into shippable slices, help set technical direction, and raise the bar on reliability, security, and speed.

What you&#x27;ll do:

<pre><code>    - Own the backend: spend meaningful time writing and reviewing production code.

    - Architecture stewardship: keep the system coherent as we scale questionnaire-driven workflows and FHIR pipelines.

    - Reliability &amp; quality: Establish testing strategy (unit&#x2F;integration&#x2F;contract&#x2F;E2E), migrations, rollouts (feature flags).

    - Observability: Instrument tracing&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;logging, build dashboards&#x2F;alerts; drive incident reviews.
    
    - Raise the engineering bar: define and enforce code review policy, branching model, testing strategy, and CI&#x2F;CD gates.
    
    - Partner with Product &amp; domain experts: translate healthcare workflows into configurable front-end modules; ensure back-end transforms to valid FHIR in Medplum.
</code></pre>
What makes you a great fit:

<pre><code>    - 8+ years building production systems, including principal&#x2F;staff scope in a startup or similar pace.

    - Deep TypeScript + Node.js and expert-level NestJS in production.

    - Track record leading cross-team projects and influencing architecture without heavy process.

    - Product sense and crisp communication; comfortable owning ambiguous problems and shipping quickly with guardrails.
</code></pre>
- Bonuses: FHIR&#x2F;Medplum, healthcare data workflows, HIPAA&#x2F;SOC 2 experience, comfortable jumping into modern frontend (React&#x2F;Next.js) when needed.

Stack: TypeScript (Next.js and NestJS), Medplum, AWS (Cognito, Fargate)

Visa&#x2F;relocation: No
