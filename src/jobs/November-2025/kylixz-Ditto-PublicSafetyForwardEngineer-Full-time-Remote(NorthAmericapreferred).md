Ditto - Public Safety Forward Engineer - Full-time - Remote (North America preferred)

Ditto is building an edge-first, peer2peer database and streaming APIs that solve challenging data synchronization problems. Our core is built on CRDTs and Rust.

If you know networking, ATAK, p2p, ROS2 or wireless MANETs please apply. I’m building out a team to apply the technology to life saving markets and need a hand. You’ll own some greenfield development, get out in the field with firefighters, work with UAVs, and ride multicast over cutting edge mesh radios.

Compensation 130-210k + equity and benefits.
