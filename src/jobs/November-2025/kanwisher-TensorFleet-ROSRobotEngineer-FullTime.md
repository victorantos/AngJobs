TensorFleet - ROS Robot Engineer - Onsite &amp; Remote (Bangkok) - FullTime

We are sick of a few companies controlling all robots. Do you have a robot vacuum running around you house? How can we trust a future when a humanoid robot is being tele controlled in our house.

We are building open source software to make open firmware drones a reality. We have a VS Code Extension to make coding ROS and PX4 a breeze for beginners. We are also working on courses for building drones.

Are you excited about building open source robots and do you have experience in Go, C++ (ROS) or Javascript (Vs Code extension development). Drop me an email matt@tensorflow.net
