We’re building the account intelligence layer (the missing brain between the data warehouse and enterprise apps) to orchestrate AI agents that actually move revenue and retention, not just demo well.

We’re live with several enterprise customers and hearing: “I’m super excited!! You’re changing our lives!!” — Account Manager (mid-market).

We are backed by Acrew Capital, Emerson Collective, Recall Capital, and angels from LinkedIn, BetterUp, Glean, and Scale AI. Strong pipeline beyond what’s already in production.
