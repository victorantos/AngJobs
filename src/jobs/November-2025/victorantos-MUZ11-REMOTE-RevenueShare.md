MUZ11 - Growth Hacker&#x2F;Partner - REMOTE - Revenue Share

MUZ11 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;muz11.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;muz11.com</a>) is a new music streaming platform specifically designed for developers and professionals who listen to music while coding&#x2F;working. I&#x27;m building the default music player for focused work sessions.

I&#x27;m seeking experienced growth hackers for a partnership role focused on acquiring Premium subscribers. This is a 50&#x2F;50 revenue share model where you earn up to $5&#x2F;month per Premium subscriber (launching this week).

What I&#x27;m looking for:
- Proven user acquisition experience, especially in B2C SaaS
- Understanding of developer&#x2F;tech professional communities  
- Self-directed approach to growth strategies
- Ability to drive conversions to paid subscriptions

This is a true partnership opportunity - no salary, pure performance-based revenue share. Full autonomy in your growth approach. If you build a base of 1,000 users, that&#x27;s $5k&#x2F;month recurring.

I&#x27;m committed to responding to all applicants. Email muz11@victorantos.com with examples of your growth work and your approach for MUZ11.
