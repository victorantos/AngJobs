iM3 - Junior Developers (2) - Christchurch, NZ - Hybrid (mostly WFH) - Contract → possible long-term

We build AI-driven imaging software for vets - capturing and analysing x-rays to find dental issues in animals. We train our own models, are totally AI-pilled and use Claude Code and AI-assisted coding heavily day-to-day.

Looking for junior or new-grad devs with solid fundamentals and curiosity — no need to know our stack (Clojure, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Python, k8s, WPF, Svelte, Postgres). Just bring enthusiasm and a willingness to learn.

Hybrid in Christchurch New Zealand (mostly WFH, a few meetups each week). 3-month initial contract, likely ongoing if it clicks.
