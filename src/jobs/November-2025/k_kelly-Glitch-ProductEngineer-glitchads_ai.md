Glitch - Product Engineer - Ireland &amp; Remote (EMEA preferred) - glitchads.ai

Glitch is building the AI agent for Advertising

Glitch let&#x27;s Businesses create Ad Campaigns in 5 minutes (Down from 5 days) that perform 5 times better than traditional agencies. Our AI makes high performing ads available to everyone.

We need Engineers who want to tackle hard problems like treating the real world as context for LLMs, understanding markets in a few seconds, and dealing with the complex ML algorithms that underlie digital advertising.

We are a team of 8 and a mix of Startup Hustlers and ex-Google Ads Engineers. We&#x27;ve raised Seed and are doubling our customer base every quarter.

We love python, react, tailwind, OpenAI, Google Cloud, and Claude Code. The ideal candidate is running 10-15 instances of Claude Code at once.
