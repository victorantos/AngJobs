Fyxed.com - Fintech Engineers - Fully Remote

Fyxed deploys capital to landlords and their property managers for cash needs like repairs, turnovers, and improvements on rental properties.

We&#x27;re at an inflection point where we have the deployment capital ($50M) to really take a big swing at this opportunity.

The perfect candidate has prior fintech (lending) experience, loves wrangling the complexities of reconciling&#x2F;tracking money, and bonus points if you&#x27;ve built on top of Column.com&#x27;s API.
