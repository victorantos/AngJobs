JetKVM - Senior Fullstack Engineer - Remote (CET ±3) - Full-Time - Go &#x2F; TypeScript &#x2F; WebRTC - Open Source

JetKVM builds open-source KVM-over-IP hardware that lets you control any computer — BIOS and all — through your browser. After raising $6M on Kickstarter (the #3 most-backed tech project ever), we’re scaling production and software for tens of thousands of users.

We’re looking for a Senior Fullstack Engineer to work across our stack — Go, Node.js, React, and WebRTC — from backend APIs to low-level firmware integrations. You’ll shape architecture, improve video streaming and authentication, and ship features end-to-end in a small, fast-moving team.
Open-source, async, and remote(CET+&#x2F;-3).
