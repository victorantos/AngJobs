I’ve spent more than ten years building and scaling cross‑platform products, from a social app that grew to 1 M users to embedded stacks for quick‑service restaurants. I’ve founded companies, raised venture capital, led engineering teams, and today I ship everything from React Native apps to Rust firmware on single-board computers.

Best at taking things from zero to production and turning chaotic codebases into production-ready, scalable systems. You can see my full work at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;koray.onl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;koray.onl</a>. Please reach out if you’d like to learn more.
