BIASafe AI - Front-end Engineer (React) - Full-Time - ONSITE (Montréal)

We&#x27;re building a B2B digital quantitative portfolio manager platform for family
offices and hedge funds. Our platform allows portfolio managers to create,
backtest, test and execute systematic quantitative trading strategies. We are
currently closing our seed round.

We are looking for a front-end developer to join us IN PERSON at our brand new
offices in downtown Montréal&#x27;s FinTech Station. The ideal candidate will have 3+
years of experience in React as well as a strong sense and ability for design.
Good general software engineering knowledge is also a must. The candidate will
work in a small team and own the front-end development, mocking, CI&#x2F;CD, support
and maintenance. We have a very highly detailed Figma model and we are looking
for the right talent to bring it to life.

Interested applicants should contact me at mabelanger + hn at biasafe dot ai.
Please put our exact company name in the subject line. Please send a CV along
with a short introduction and I will do my best to get back to you ASAP!
