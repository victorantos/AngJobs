Carrot - Product Designer - Full-Time - Remote (US-based, Pacific morning availability required) - www.getcarrot.io

We&#x27;re building the leading all-in-one platform for cannabis dispensaries—covering ecommerce, loyalty, marketing, and delivery. We create opinionated software that empowers any dispensary operator to build a powerful digital growth engine for their store. Our team combines deep first-hand dispensary experience with a shared desire to make valuable things with great UX.

The role: 
You&#x27;ll work directly with our Head of Product to design both consumer-facing ecommerce experiences and complex admin workflows. You&#x27;ll own the full design lifecycle—from user research through implementation—and help evolve our design system. We value designers who check their ego at the door and care more about building the best solution than always being right.

We&#x27;re looking for:
Strong product design fundamentals, autonomy through the full development lifecycle, Figma expertise with complex component systems, and comfort designing for both visual polish, and interaction complexity. Bonus points for ecommerce&#x2F;loyalty experience, branding skills, or past work with small teams.

Process: 
Send resume + portfolio link + brief fit explanation to seb [at] getcarrot.io with subject &quot;Product Designer&quot;. Decision within 1-2 interviews.
