Sitch App - Founding Product Manager - NYC-area HYBRID (2-3 days&#x2F;week in NYC near Union Square) - Full-time

Sitch is a new type of concierge dating app. We&#x27;re using AI + Humans to ask you questions, get to know you, then help you find love.

We&#x27;re an AI powered concierge matchmaker for serious daters. Sitch is live in 5 cities and expanding nationally in 2026.

We&#x27;re philosophically opposed to the dopamine-fueled mini-game doomswiping of &#x27;traditional&#x27; dating apps which cynically monetizes desperation. We&#x27;re monetizing intent!

* We&#x27;re top-tier VC funded (a16z Speedrun, M13, early Snap angels)
* Looking for a PM who loves building for consumers, loves relationships, is a bit unusual, and is obsessed with building unique experiences only made possible with the new era of LLMs

* 2-3 days&#x2F;week in person, in Manhattan near Union Square
