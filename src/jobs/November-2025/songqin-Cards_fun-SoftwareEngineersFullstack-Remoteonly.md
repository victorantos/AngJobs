Cards.fun - Software Engineers (Fullstack) - Remote only

We&#x27;re digitizing pokemon cards and creating unprecedented financialization of card assets. We&#x27;re a small bootstrapped team. Interested in those able to wield Claude Code effectively, and take a test-driven approach. Bonus points if you have any interest in tokenization of RWAs. Our stack is written in Rust, with a vanilla JS and templated HTML frontend.
