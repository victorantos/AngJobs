Guideline Guru - Senior Software Engineer - Remote (US Eastern Time ± 2 hrs) - Full-time

Our AI assistant for mortgage underwriting guidelines helps lenders get faster answers, reduce mistakes, and close more loans.

We&#x27;re profitable, bootstrapped, and small — building software that makes life easier for our lender partners.

Looking for a senior full-stack engineer (Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Postgres, some frontend) with a track record of impact at product-focused startups. Someone who owns projects end-to-end, ships quickly, and balances pragmatism with quality.

Strong communication, curiosity, and humility matter most. You&#x27;ll work directly with the founders to shape our architecture, extend our platform, and influence technical direction as we scale.

We move fast, build thoughtfully, and keep a sustainable 40-hour pace.
