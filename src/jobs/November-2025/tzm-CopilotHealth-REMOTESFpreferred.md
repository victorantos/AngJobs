We’re building the operating system for medical AI agents—enabling at-home diagnostics with computer vision and voice AI to deliver continuous, equitable care in a broken system. Targeting asynchronous care, we serve hospitals, rural and specialty clinics with &gt;85% diagnostic accuracy and &gt;70% patient engagement.

Mission: fix healthcare access and equity.

Tech: PyTorch, 3D reconstruction, SAM, React, Swift&#x2F;SwiftUI (iOS), Kotlin (Android), React&#x2F;Next.js (web), GCP, FHIR, Temporal, MemGPT. HIPAA-compliant (SOC 2 in process)

Roles

<pre><code>  - AI Platform Engineer: Scale vision-language models, voice AI (emotion&#x2F;intent), 3D&#x2F;hyperspectral pipelines, multi-agent systems, FHIR integrations.
  - ML Engineer: Fine-tune VLMs (e.g., Moondream) on Med-VQA&#x2F;RAD for medical VQA, detection, captioning. Optimize for on-device.
  - Front-End Engineer: React UIs for patients&#x2F;providers with voice and diagnostic visualization.
  - Mobile Engineer: Develop native iOS (Swift&#x2F;SwiftUI) apps for seamless voice (ElevenLabs), camera capture, intents and conversational workflows.
