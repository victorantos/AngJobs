I am looking for a postdoctoral fellow interested in the intersection of programming languages and artificial intelligence, in particular verification and large language models.

Our main goal is to create a PL+AI system that is the best at verified program synthesis. We will use the verification-aware programming language Dafny and co-evolve an LLM and a discovery system for Dafny.

Please contact me at namin@seas.harvard.edu if interested. Include a CV and GitHub link.
