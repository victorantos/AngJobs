Nothing.tech - Senior Full-Stack Engineer - London, UK - Full-time - ONSITE

We sit at the intersection of Hardware x Software. We&#x27;ve raised $350M and sold more than $1B in devices last year.

We’re building a different kind of technology company, one that puts design, emotion, and human creativity at the heart of everything we do. From the way our products look and feel to how we communicate and present ourselves in culture, we believe technology should evoke a sense of emotion.

We created an icon with Phone (1) and changed the over-ear market with Headphone (1).

Now working on a new form factor for the AI era.

We are looking for exceptional, high-agency Full-Stack engineers who are passionate about using AI to build the future of consumer electronics!
