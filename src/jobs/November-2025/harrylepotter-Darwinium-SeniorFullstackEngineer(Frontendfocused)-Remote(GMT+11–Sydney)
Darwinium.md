Darwinium - Senior Fullstack Engineer (Frontend focused) - Enterprise Fraud &amp; Risk Management - Remote (GMT+11 – Sydney)
Darwinium helps some of the world’s biggest companies stop fraud before it happens — without breaking the experience for genuine customers. We do this through a unique edge-deployed architecture that provides real-time visibility and control across every customer journey.

We’re a VC-backed startup of 35 people, with engineering and product based in Sydney. The founding team previously built and exited companies in the fraud and security space (including billion-dollar outcomes).

The role: We’re looking for a senior fullstack engineer who enjoys working across boundaries from TypeScript frontends and backend services to data pipelines and distributed systems. You’ll work closely with our platform and product teams to build the tools that power customer fraud detection and orchestration. Someone who has built vscode extensions or has worked closely in the fraud or security space would be a bonus

Our stack: Rust for the engine, ClickHouse for persistence, TypeScript (React + Node) for frontend and ancillary services, deployed globally at the edge.
