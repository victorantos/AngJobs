At Jeenie, we’re building technology that breaks down language barriers. Our platform connects people with live, professional linguists — providing on-demand interpretation in 300+ languages.

We’re a small, fast-moving team, and this role is a critical hire to help us scale our platform and shape the next generation of our architecture. You’ll work closely with our Architects and Innovation teams to solve real-world problems that directly impact people’s access to healthcare, legal services, and more.

Location: Remote (U.S.)
Eligibility: U.S. Citizen or Green Card Holder

If you like working on meaningful problems, enjoy autonomy, and want your code to have a real-world impact — we’d love to talk.
