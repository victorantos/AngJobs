New Hedge fund - Full Stack Engineer - On-site (NYC)

We are a new discretionary, tech industry focused hedge fund, founded by a portfolio manager with 15+ years of experience at a Tiger Cub. I lead the data&#x2F;technology team here and previously spent ~6 years in a similar role at a well known Tiger Cub and briefly running a data startup.

We are hiring for: 
- Fullstack engineer for our internal research management web application

Our tech stack: * Frontend: Typescript, Vue3 * Backend: Cloudflare, Supabase&#x2F;Postgresql, Typescript *

On the data side: AWS, Cloudflare, Snowflake, Clickhouse, Dagster

Obviously, we are not the only ones trying to figure out how to use AI in investing but in a world where there are lots of people trying to build picks &amp; shovels, this is an opportunity to be one of the goldminers at a greenfield, new firm. This role makes sense for people who are interested in finance&#x2F;investing (although you do not necessarily have to have experience in the industry).

We&#x27;re in full-time in office in NYC, so that&#x27;s a requirement for FTE.

We work very hard, hours are long, and people are very dedicated to the mission. It is not for everyone, but for those interested in competing in financial markets, love startup atmosphere without near-term existential risk, and want to work with super smart colleagues (both technical and investors!), this could be a great fit.

I write about hedge fund data teams frequently here, if you are just interested in learning about the space: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magis.substack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magis.substack.com&#x2F;</a>

Target salary 180-250K, depending on experience + Bonus&#x2F;Carry (hedge fund equity equivalent)

What we&#x27;re looking for:
- 4-8 YoE in Typescript (we use Vue) + Python experience 
- Ability to be in-office in NYC
- Bonus: SQL (ie. you know Window Functions), AWS (ie. you&#x27;d know how to configure an IAM role)
