Perpay - Senior Full Stack&#x2F;Backend Engineer + Engineering Manager - Onsite in Philadelphia, Full-Time

Perpay is building financial products backed by users&#x27; paycheck direct deposit. We believe everyone deserves a chance to improve their financial future, and we’re dedicated to building simple and inclusive financial products that help our members create healthy habits and achieve economic stability. We&#x27;ve really hit our stride in terms of growth the last 18 months, and that curve is still steepening.

We&#x27;re looking for:

- A few Senior Full-stack or Backend Engineers across our 3 product engineering teams. We highly value product-mindset, experience building production web apps for real users, and ability to coach and support more junior engineers.

- A technically hands-on Engineering Manager. Ideally, you have at least a year or two of experience leading people and being accountable for a team&#x27;s execution, roadmap, and performance. You would be the fourth &quot;line manager&quot; on our team, and so there&#x27;s ample opportunity to grab org-wide initiatives that are interesting and impactful.

Our stack includes AWS, Postgres, Python&#x2F;Django, React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Typescript, Datadog

Some other company notes &#x2F; benefits: Open PTO policy, full health&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision, strong total cash comp, remote weeks around major holidays + extra holiday on weekends like MDW and LDW, catered lunch 3 days&#x2F;wk, 401k w&#x2F; solid match, cell phone plan, gym subsidy, and some student loan repayment match.
