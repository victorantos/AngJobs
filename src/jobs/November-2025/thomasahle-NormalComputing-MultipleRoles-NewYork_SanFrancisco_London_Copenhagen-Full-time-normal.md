Normal Computing - Multiple Roles - New York, San Francisco, London, Copenhagen - ONSITE&#x2F;HYBRID - Full-time - normalcomputing.ai

Normal Computing is building a new thermodynamic computing paradigm to revolutionize AI reasoning and reliability. We&#x27;re bridging AI to the world&#x27;s most sensitive industrial and manufacturing applications, starting with semiconductors.

Funded by top-tier VCs, we&#x27;re shipping real solutions to customers weekly while pushing the boundaries of AI for hardware. Tech stack: Python, TypeScript, React, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, PyTorch, Hugging Face

Open roles:

Full Stack Engineer - Build performant web applications for semiconductor companies. Design visualization tools, diagnostic assistants, and test version control systems. 4-7 years experience, expert in TypeScript&#x2F;React, backend experience in Python. Bonus: semiconductor industry experience, LLMs, visual design.

AI Engineer - Build production systems that understand chip design specifications and generate code. Ship improvements weekly using LLMs, reinforcement learning, and agentic workflows. Experience with production AI systems, document understanding, PyTorch, prompt engineering. Bonus: mission-critical deployments, RLHF&#x2F;RLAIF, program synthesis.

Sr DevOps Engineer - Design and operate cloud infrastructure for AI products in semiconductor environments. 5+ years DevOps&#x2F;SRE experience, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI&#x2F;CD pipelines. Bonus: highly-regulated environments, Python&#x2F;Go, Ansible, ML infrastructure.

Physical Design Engineer - Lead SOC implementation from floorplanning to tape-out for our novel thermodynamic computing architectures. Experience with SOC implementation, Synthesis&#x2F;PNR&#x2F;STA, Verilog, physical verification. Bonus: Cadence tools, asynchronous logic, startup experience.
