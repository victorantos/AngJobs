Xata - REMOTE Europe, North America and South America - xata.io

Xata is a platform that lets developers create instant branches of their Postgres databases using anonymized production data.
It replaces traditional, shared staging environments with isolated, fast, and secure database copies, so every developer or AI agent can work safely on real data without risking production.

We are looking for:

- Platform engineer (ideally based in east coast timezones: Canada, USA or South America)

- Backend (Go) engineer

- Frontend engineer

- Developer educator

- Sales engineer
