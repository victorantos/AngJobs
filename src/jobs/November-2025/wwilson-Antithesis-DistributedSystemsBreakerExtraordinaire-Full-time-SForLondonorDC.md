Antithesis - Distributed Systems Breaker Extraordinaire - Full-time - SF or London or DC

---

Have you always wanted to channel your inner Kyle Kingsbury? We are looking to hire somebody with a deep understanding of distributed systems who can bring open source or customer software under test in our platform and find fun issues in it.

Preferred locations: SF, London, DC. Remote is a possibility for this role if you&#x27;re really good (though be aware that we&#x27;re a very in-person company culturally speaking, so it might be annoying for you).

To apply: email &#x27;will&#x27; at our company domain with a description of something interesting that you&#x27;ve worked on.
