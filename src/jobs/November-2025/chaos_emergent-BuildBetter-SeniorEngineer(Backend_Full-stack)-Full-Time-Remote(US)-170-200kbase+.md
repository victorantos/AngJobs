BuildBetter - Senior Engineer (Backend, Full-stack) - Full-Time - Remote (US) - 170-200k base + equity - Visa Sponsorship not provided

BuildBetter is the product operations platform for customer-led teams. We&#x27;ve built an AI-first product that lets our customers, like Rappi, n8n, and Posthog, automate the operations work that lets them provide their customers with world-class product experiences.

We&#x27;re looking for two senior engineers to join the team; our headcount has remained small while growing revenue, and we&#x27;re now bottlenecked by development speed in a way that will make you invaluable. You&#x27;ll have real ownership over your code from product ideation to customer support, and we&#x27;ll be making substantive product updates weekly. We&#x27;re looking for team players who are as fun to work with as they are productive, and are willing to compensate these two rolls commensurately - our aim is to be in the 95th percentile of equity compensation, and we expect that in exchange we&#x27;ll have value-aligned employees who will help us grow the business.

Joining us will mean solving hard problems at the frontier of AI adoption, including:

- maintaining performance at scale

- building and maintaining rich frontend user experiences that maintain the standards of usability and delight that our customers know us for.

- building agent and workflow systems that automate real work for customers

- playing around with the latest models to figure out new experiences that we can offer our customers as cutting-edge models get released monthly

- building automation that&#x27;s grounded in supporting product teams rather than automating them - our bet is that this is the likelier outcome out of the current generation of AI systems

Stack: Postgres &#x2F; TS (Nest + React) &#x2F; Hasura &#x2F; EKS &#x2F; S3 &#x2F; LLM APIs &#x2F; Python

Benefits:

- unlimited PTO

- $100&#x2F;mo education stipend

- flexible hours: we measure productivity in terms of outcomes, not time, so as long as you&#x27;re able to stay aligned, productive, and in regular communication, we don&#x27;t really care what hours you work

- health insurance
