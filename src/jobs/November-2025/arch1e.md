I’m a generalist developer with a focus on Go and TypeScript, and experience across Svelte, React, and Vue. I’ve built and maintained several open-source projects (github.com&#x2F;hayzamjs) and have a strong background in Linux&#x2F;*BSD, cloud, bare metal, and networking&#x2F;telephony.

I like working close to the metal and thrive in small, early-stage teams where experimentation, autonomy, and fast shipping matter.

Feel free to reach out — happy to chat.
