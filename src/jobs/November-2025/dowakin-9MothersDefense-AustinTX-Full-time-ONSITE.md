9 Mothers Defense - Robotics &#x2F; Data Scientist - Austin TX - Full-time - ONSITE

We&#x27;re building AI-driven turrets that stop hostile drones - where robotics needs F1-level speed.

We&#x27;re looking for smart, T-shaped teammates: people who are experts in one area but happy to jump in wherever needed. Our software team is small, so every member makes a real impact.

If you want to write motor control in Zig, optimize camera processing with custom CUDA kernels on Jetson, or rework a transformer-based tracker to handle small objects - you can do that here, and much more.

US persons only
