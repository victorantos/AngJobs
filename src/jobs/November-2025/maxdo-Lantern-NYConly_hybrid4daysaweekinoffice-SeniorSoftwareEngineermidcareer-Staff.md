Lantern - NYC only, hybrid 4 days a week in office - Senior Software Engineer (mid career - Staff)

Lantern is Series A company, building the future of sales automation with AI agents that actually work. We&#x27;re replacing the messy patchwork of enrichment tools, intent platforms, and automation software with a single system that does it all—pulling from 150+ data sources to research prospects, verify contacts, and help close deals.

We&#x27;re a small, focused team tackling hard problems at the intersection of AI and enterprise data. You&#x27;ll be working directly on the core product, helping us build intelligent systems that can reason about complex sales workflows and make autonomous decisions.

On any given day, you might:

- Build reliable agentic workflows that orchestrate multi-step research and outreach processes

- Design data pipelines that synthesize insights from hundreds of disparate sources into actionable intelligence

- Architect systems that scale gracefully as we handle increasingly complex prospect analysis and verification

- Collaborate directly with early customers to understand how our AI agents can solve their hardest go-to-market challenges

Tools we use:

- Python, LangGraph, BAML, Temporal.io, ClickHouse, Postgres, dlt
- TypeScript, React
- AWS, Modal.com, K8s, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions

This is a chance to work on genuinely novel problems in AI—not just fine-tuning LLMs, but building autonomous agents that can navigate messy real-world data and make smart decisions. If you&#x27;re excited about pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can do in production, we&#x27;d love to talk.
