Kadoa - Web Scraping&#x2F;Software Engineer - Remote - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com</a>

We’re automating web scraping at scale with AI. Web scraping used to be the same for decades (writing and maintaining rule-based scripts for each source), and we&#x27;re fully automating that process with LLMs. 
We&#x27;re also heavily focused on making ethical scraping the default (robots.txt checks, rate limiting, any custom compliance rules).

But we can&#x27;t do it alone. We are looking for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship, data, and AI. We are growing fast, have a “no-bullshit” policy, and try to minimize the distance between the code you write and the customers who use it. We iterate to greatness :)

We&#x27;re currently looking for a senior web scraping engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;web-scraping-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kadoa.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;web-scraping-engineer</a>

If that sounds like you, please email me at (adrian at kadoa dot com) and mention HN in the subject line. Ideally you include an ETL or scraping project you&#x27;ve been working on in the past.
