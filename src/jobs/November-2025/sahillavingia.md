Gumroad — NYC (onsite&#x2F;hybrid) — Hiring Product&#x2F;Engineering

We build tools that help creators sell directly to their audiences. Small team, big surface area: you’ll ship end-to-end (product → design → code → metrics).

Looking for: strong product-minded engineers (backend, full-stack, or generalist). Bonus if you’ve built marketplaces, payments, or creator tools.

Nice-to-have stack: Rails&#x2F;Stripe&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;React&#x2F;TypeScript—but we value ownership over checkboxes.

Email sahil@gumroad.com with a couple links (GitHub, portfolio) and 2–3 sentences on why you want to build for creators.
