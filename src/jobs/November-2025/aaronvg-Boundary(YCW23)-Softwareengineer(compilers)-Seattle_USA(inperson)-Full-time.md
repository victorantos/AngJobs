Boundary (YC W23) - Software engineer (compilers) - Seattle, USA (in person) - Full-time

We are building a new programming language (BAML) to build AI agents -- the &quot;typescript&quot; for LLMs. We are open source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BoundaryML&#x2F;baml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BoundaryML&#x2F;baml</a>

A big part of this language is all the tooling around visualizing non-deterministic code, visualizing code, and getting great observability (e.g. our language has type information at runtime unlike TS).

We are looking for engineers with experience with Rust, programming languages, and&#x2F;or compilers. Any amount of experience is fine.
