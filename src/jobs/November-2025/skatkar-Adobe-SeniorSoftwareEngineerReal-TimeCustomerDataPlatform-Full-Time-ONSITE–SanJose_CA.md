Adobe - Senior Software Engineer (Real-Time Customer Data Platform) - Full-Time - ONSITE – (San Jose, CA)

My team at Adobe is hiring senior engineers to scale the Real-Time Customer Data Platform, which processes trillions of events to power real-time personalization for global brands. This is deep, low-latency distributed systems work — not typical enterprise app dev.

We use: Java, Scala, Spring Boot, Kafka, Spark, Flink, Cosmos DB, Aerospike, FoundationDB, Delta Lake, K8s, Azure&#x2F;AWS, Docker, OpenAI, Vector DBs.

Looking for:

• 5+ years building large-scale distributed or streaming systems

• Strong backend skills (Java&#x2F;Scala, concurrency, perf tuning)

• Experience with Kafka&#x2F;Spark&#x2F;Flink and cloud-native systems

Bonus: Martech&#x2F;Adtech, identity resolution, or personalization experience.
