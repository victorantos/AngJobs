Materialize - NYC Onsite &#x2F; Hybrid - Full-time

Materialize is the live data layer for apps and AI agents. It lets your team use SQL to transform siloed operational data into up-to-the-second views of your business, helping you operate confidently in dynamic environments. Use Materialize to deliver fresh context to AI agents, power data-intensive UIs, and create low-latency, event-driven architectures that drive microservices and core business processes. Materialize is trusted by General Mills, Bilt Rewards, and Crane Worldwide Logistics to solve their most pressing operational data challenges while building a live data foundation for their AI transformation.

Under the hood, Materialize is a novel distributed database capable of incremental view maintenance over arbitrary SQL. We think it&#x27;s pretty cool :D
