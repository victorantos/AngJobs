You might be a good fit if you:

- Care about correctness and reliability in complex systems

- Have experience with infrastructure automation, CI&#x2F;CD, or compilers

- Enjoy working in OCaml or another strongly typed functional language

- Value autonomy and precision in engineering

Stack: OCaml, Postgres, Docker
