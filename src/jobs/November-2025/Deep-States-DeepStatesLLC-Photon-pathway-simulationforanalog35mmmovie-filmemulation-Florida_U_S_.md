Deep States LLC - Photon-pathway-simulation for analog 35mm movie-film emulation - Florida, U.S.A - Part-time - REMOTE or local.

Deep States LLC is building the most realistic analog film-emulation system ever created. We&#x27;re bringing back the classic 35mm film stocks that defined cinema in the 1980s.

We&#x27;re modelling photon-pathways on superchip systems; to simulate the sophisticated light-interactions between the layers in real film. We aim to perfectly digitally-replicate the unique photo-chemical properties of celluloid.

We&#x27;re looking for self-taught C programmers with wild-eyes and a thirst for breaking new ground. Can you perfectly model &quot;Kodak Eastman Color Negative II 100T 5247&quot; film stock on a rack of superchips? Let&#x27;s find out.

Contact us if you want to be part of the first team to crack-the-code of celluloid. We seek renegade coders who want to make a dent in the universe, and have the intellectual-firepower to deliver the holy-grail: Digitally modeling photon-pathway interactions in REAL analog film strata.
