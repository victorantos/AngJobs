At Rally, we believe talking to your users is the key to building great products. Our platform is used by teams at Google, Figma, GitLab, MongoDB, and more to streamline every step of the user research process in one tool.

We’re a remote-first, Series A startup with a small, senior team of builders. While we’re remote, we value connection—hosting regular in-person offsites and providing a yearly remote office stipend.

As a Senior&#x2F;Staff Backend Engineer, you’ll be central to scaling Rally’s systems to power hundreds of millions of participant records and billions of events. You’ll own core infrastructure like email&#x2F;SMS delivery, data pipelines, search, and workflow automation—and lay the foundation for new AI-driven features.

We’re fully built in TypeScript and use AWS, Postgres, ElasticSearch, Kafka, and Temporal. No requirements to have previous Typescript experience, but need to be willing to learn.

Join us if you love building for scale, value craftsmanship, and want to shape the backend foundation of a fast-growing product used by the world’s best product teams.
