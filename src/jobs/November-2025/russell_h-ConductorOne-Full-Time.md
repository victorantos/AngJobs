ConductorOne - ONSITE (SF &#x2F; PDX) - Full-Time

ConductorOne is building the platform for identity security and least privilege automation — helping companies secure access to everything, without slowing people down. Our engineering culture emphasizes small, high-ownership teams that deliver measurable impact and move quickly.

We’re hiring across many areas:

<pre><code>  - Software Engineers – We’re growing our product development teams in SF and Portland.

  - Site Reliability Engineering – We’re looking for SREs and a hands-on SRE manager (SF or Portland) to own reliability, performance, and infrastructure as we scale.

  - Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) – We’re building a brand-new customer-facing engineering org: we&#x27;re looking for engineers who want to work closely with customers to modernize and automate identity operations, and a Manager, FDE to lead the team.

  - Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance (GRC) – We’re building a new GRC function and hiring our first Compliance Engineer to help scale our security and audit programs.

We work primarily in Go and TypeScript, on AWS + Kubernetes.
