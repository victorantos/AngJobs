Speckle - Backend (Engineering), Founding Account Executive (Growth) - Full-Time - REMOTE - US East, London, EU - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;speckle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;speckle</a>

At Speckle [0], we’re on a mission to shake up the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To do that, we&#x27;re building the OSS data layer for AEC to operationalize how the built environment industry works with data and automation. Think of us as a cross between Github and Palantir, with an opportunity to significantly impact a $10 trillion industry. Our platform already powers workflows on billion dollar projects at leading firms like Suffolk, Multiconsult, Pomerleau, and Stantec.

I&#x27;m the CEO&#x2F;founder and I can honestly vouch that we&#x27;re tight knit team that values autonomy and shipping cool product on top of our data layer (me included - and this might be a red flag for some, but it&#x27;s my therapy) over hierarchy, politics, levels and complexity (my spirit animal is the grug brained developer). We love working together with our customers - construction is truly a unique place where each project is its own micro universe.

We have multiple roles open across engineering and growth (sales &amp; marketing) [1]
