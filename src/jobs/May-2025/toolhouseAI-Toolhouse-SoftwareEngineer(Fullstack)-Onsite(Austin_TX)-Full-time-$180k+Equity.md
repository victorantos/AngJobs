Toolhouse - Software Engineer (Fullstack) - Onsite (Austin, TX) - Full-time - $180k + Equity

What if you built a product that helped thousands of engineers build AI features and AI agents? That is what we do at Toolhouse.

We are a high performance team working in the &quot;infra&#x2F;backend&quot; horizontal space. We are building the infrastructure that powers AI products and agentic workflows.

We&#x27;re building a team of special people that want to win in Austin.

This is no 9-5 gig. You&#x27;re in or you&#x27;re out.
This is a startup and we need to ship code to make this thing happen. 
You will learn to trust your gut feeling and the data attached to any decision, and we do it all together.

We are looking for engineers who are excited to do great work. 
- Engineers who trust their instincts and who also love to discuss ideas and write them down. Humans invented writing, and built the future.
- People who enjoy building developer tools that can really help other developers.

No BS attitude. Just engineers shipping code and having a good time doing it.

The role: You’ll work across our stack (TypeScript, Python, Postgres, Docker), building powerful backend and frontend for a population relying on function calling infrastructure, RAG, evals, and tons of data (prompts).

Perks: Equity vesting from day one, unlimited PTO, lunches, a real family outside of your own.

We’re in-person &amp; in Austin. We do not sponsor visas.

We don&#x27;t want your resume, show us what you shipped on Github - send it via email to our toolhouse.ai inbox: hello@...
