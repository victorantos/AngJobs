SerpApi - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serpapi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serpapi.com</a> - Junior to Senior Fullstack Engineer positions - Customer Success Engineer - and more... - Based in Austin, TX but remote-first structure - Full-time - FULLY REMOTE or ONSITE - $150K - 180K a year 1099 for US or local avg + 20% for outside the US

SerpApi is the leading API to scrape and parse search engine results. We deeply support Google, Google Maps, Google Images, Bing, Baidu, and a lot more.

We are still hiring - we have so much work and we&#x27;re after great people to help out! I only started at SerpApi late last year myself and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.

We do continuous integration, continuous deployments, code reviews, code pairings, profit sharing, and most of communication is async via GitHub.

Our current stack is Ruby, Rails, MongoDB, and React.JS. We are looking for more Junior and Senior FullStack Engineers. We have an awesome work environment: We are a remote first company (before Covid!).

We very strongly value transparency, do open books, have a public roadmap, and contribute to the EFF.
