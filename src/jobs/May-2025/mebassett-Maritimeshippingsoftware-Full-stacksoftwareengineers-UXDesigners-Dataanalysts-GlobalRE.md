Maritime shipping software - Full-stack software engineers - UX Designers - Implementation Managers &amp; Customer Success execs - Data analysts - Global REMOTE - UCT-8 to UCT+4

Would you like  to help tackle one of the most important sectors for the global economy - maritime shipping?
We&#x27;re hiring for multiple roles: software engineers, data analysts, UI&#x2F;UX designers, implementation managers.

Nearly every person is affected by stuff shipping on the seas - whether its energy, ore, or wind turbines, but the industry itself is antiquated and archaic, and hampered by paperwork and bureaucracy. Our customers are crying out for better solutions. We&#x27;re looking for people to help us build those solutions.

If you&#x27;re the sort of person who is:
 - intellectually curious about new industries 
 - wanting talking to and getting close to end users 
 - keen to use LLMs and other AI tools

Then please get in touch.

For our SWE roles we have budgeted ~ 90k USD.

Our tech stack for new projects is largely typescript&#x2F;vue&#x2F;mysql (we have several fans of fp-ts and EffectT with us and are investing in using more functional programming). But like the industry at large we also have significant legacy code in javascript. If you&#x27;re the sort of person who likes refactoring complex projects to make them more workable, then we also want to hear from you.

For our Data Analyst or Implementation Manager roles:

You&#x27;ll be helping our customers in maritime shipping get the most from our software.  Initially, a lot of that work will be in helping our customers get their data in and out of it.  Lot&#x27;s of MySQL, Metabase, AWS Glue, DBT, or other ETL pipelines.

For our UI&#x2F;UX designer roles we have budgeted ~ 40k USD.

You&#x27;ll be helping us on three different axes: (1) designing the user interface for new features, (2) fleshing out the user journeys and mockups for our roadmap, and (3) helping us craft a consistent and learnable user experience across all our software.

We hire remotely and globally with offices in Houston, London, Singapore, and Joinville (Brasil). You should be fluent in English. The current team is &gt;20 people.  You should be in a timezone within 3 hours of one of those offices.

Interested? You can contact me directly from my profile. I&#x27;m the CTO.

Please, no recruiters or agencies.
