We are looking for two experienced back-end engineers: (1) one to lead work with our client’s e-commerce business; (2) a second to lead a greenfield project involving ML and NLP driven workflow automation tools. The ideal candidate would have experience working with large Python and Typescript codebases. We are looking for someone who is self-motivated and is able to work with a team early on in a project, plan and identify requirements, see a project through to completion, and mentor junior members of the team along the way.
