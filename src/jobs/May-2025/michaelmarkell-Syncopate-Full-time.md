Syncopate builds tools to help automate financial diligence and management of long-tail financial assets.

We&#x27;ve found product market fit with ETL&#x2F;analysis tools for niche financial data, starting with music rights, and we&#x27;re looking to build out our capabilities across more Excel + PDF-based workflows.

What we&#x27;re looking for: A full-stack engineer with experience building data-heavy applications. Experience with analytics databases like Clickhouse and data pipelining is a plus. Required to be knowledgeable in Typescript.

Big bonus points for:
1) High agency (previously a founder or built side-projects to completion)
2) Some knowledge of finance
3) Skill in Rust
