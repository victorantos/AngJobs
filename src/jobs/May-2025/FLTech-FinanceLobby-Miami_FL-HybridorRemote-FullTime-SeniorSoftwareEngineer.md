Finance Lobby - Miami, FL - Hybrid or Remote - Full Time - Senior Software Engineer

We are a Commercial Real Estate Financing marketplace that connects commercial mortgage brokers to lenders to make deals. We have over $40 billion of deals made through our platform to date.

We are a small &amp; fast moving dev team, in the process of transitioning from early stage build out to shoot-for-the-moon scalability. Our stack is Postgres, Laravel &amp; Next. We&#x27;re looking for software engineers with 8+ years of experience; remote is fine, but overlap with EST is currently important. The first round interviews are code interviews; if you don&#x27;t like that, we understand, but that&#x27;s a reasonable sign that this isn&#x27;t a good fit for you.

To apply, please send your resume to reuben@financelobby.com.
