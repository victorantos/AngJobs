Louie.ai is pioneering generative AI for data intensive investigations. This includes Vibes Investigating with AI notebooks, autonomous agentic investigations, and global-scale autowikis. On Monday, we announced speed running Splunk&#x27;s annual Boss of the SOC analyst team competition: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;leo-meyerovich-09649219_genai-activity-7324060032436731905-pC35?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAPO5vIBimmdPlYKpPDVS8xKMWdcgjz403A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;leo-meyerovich-09649219_genai...</a>

Louie builds on Graphistry: The first GPU visual graph AI platform, with support from Nvidia, Bloomberg, In-q-tel, and customers from the biggest banks and governments to startups and journalists. Our users tackle problems like cybersecurity threat hunting, misinformation, global supply chain analysis, and click stream analytics. We are profitably growing.

We are looking for someone to innovate in cybersecurity research, demos, outreach (blackhat, meetups, ...), and pitch in on solutions engineering. This is a customer and community facing role so communication, creativity, and energy are key, as is loving everything cybersecurity. Our team is distributed (US timezones primarily), and for this position, Washington DC area with clearance is a major plus - we can support S&#x2F;TS.
