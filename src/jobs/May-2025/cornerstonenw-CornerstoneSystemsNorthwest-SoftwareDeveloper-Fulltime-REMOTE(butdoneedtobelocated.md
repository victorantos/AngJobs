Cornerstone Systems Northwest - Software Developer - Fulltime - REMOTE (but do need to be located in WA, OR, CO, ID, UT) - $100k-150k&#x2F;yr - www.cornerstonenw.com

We’re a small &lt;25 employee firm that builds primarily custom web application software for a wide range of clients—public and private, large and small. We’ve been entirely remote for over 25 years, and have cultivated an asynchronous environment supported by a careful selection of tools and processes to enable people to work flexibly and efficiently. We’ve aimed for consistent steady growth and achieved that by consistently delivering quality software to our clients, and understanding their requirements often better than they do themselves.

Almost everything we code is in Javascript so relevant experience around that, typescript, React, and the Node.js ecosystem is all great.
