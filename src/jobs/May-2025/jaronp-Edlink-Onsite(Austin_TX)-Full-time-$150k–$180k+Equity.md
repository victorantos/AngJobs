Edlink - Software Engineer (Front&#x2F;Back&#x2F;Fullstack) - Onsite (Austin, TX) - Full-time - $150k–$180k + Equity

Edlink is a small, high-performing team building the data infrastructure that powers edtech. Our API helps 60M+ students and educators access the software they need to teach and learn. We solve hard problems — messy school data, ancient SIS platforms, massive scale — and we do it without red tape, meetings about meetings, or fluff.

We’re 23 people, all in on building fast, owning our work, and helping each other grow. We believe in high trust, deep work, strong opinions (held loosely), and building great tools that actually help people. No micromanagement. No bureaucracy. Just a team of sharp, kind engineers shipping great code and pushing each other to improve.

The role: You’ll work across our stack (TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, Kubernetes, Vue 2&#x2F;3), building powerful APIs and clean UIs that help integrate thousands of school systems. You’ll also work directly with developer clients who use our API — think Stripe for edtech.

Perks: Equity from day one, unlimited PTO, free downtown parking, paid parental leave, relocation support, and weekly team lunches.

We’re in-person in Austin because we believe startups build better products — and have more fun — when they work side by side.
