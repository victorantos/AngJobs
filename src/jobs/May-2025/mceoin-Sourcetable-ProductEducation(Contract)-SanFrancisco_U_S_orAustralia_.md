Sourcetable - Product Education (Contract) - San Francisco, U.S., or Australia.

Sourcetable is building a spreadsheet-based analyst. Talk to the computer, tell it what you want done, and it does the work for you.

This is a new UX, and we&#x27;re looking for a great product educator to join our team to tell that story and show people how it&#x27;s done.

You need to be exceptional at making product education videos. These particular videos will be related to using AI for spreadsheet analysis and ops work, flexing up into leveraging any python library you can think of for analysis and other shenanigans. That&#x27;s the gig.

If you need a lot of guidance it will not be a good fit.
