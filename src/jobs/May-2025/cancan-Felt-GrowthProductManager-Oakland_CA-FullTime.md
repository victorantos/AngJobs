Felt - Growth Product Manager - Oakland, CA - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com</a>

Felt is building a cloud-based geographic information systems (GIS) solution and have hundreds of customers already using it to run their operations, processing terabytes of data. Our team hails from Uber, Google, Meta, CARTO, Mapbox, The New York Times and a few others. If you have used online maps in the past few years, you have used their work. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I&#x27;m an early Uber engineer.

For the first time, we are hiring a product manager that is going to be focused on our growth funnels within our service. This person will own the onboarding journey and help those first-time customers become loyal users. This role comes at a special time where we have launched a brand new version of our SDKs and APIs where customers, especially in large enterprises, can fully integrate Felt into their own tooling [2]

Ideal candidates will have 4+ years of experience focus on growth and onboarding within B2B SaaS and&#x2F;or PLG companies. They will have a proven track record, own metrics such as time to value, be comfortable owning touchpoints, and designing and running experiments.

As mentioned, this role is the first product role at our fast growing company and will have strong leadership potential. You&#x27;ll be joining a team that&#x27;s build groundbreaking tools before, and is on the cusp of doing it again.

We are well-funded with a long runway and a strong revenue funnel already. You can read more about it our first funding here [3], and our announcement here [4]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[5]

If you are interested, please reach out via hello@felt.com and mention HN and the role you are applying to. This role is based in SF Bay Area, in our Oakland office that&#x27;s right next to the BART station. [6]
