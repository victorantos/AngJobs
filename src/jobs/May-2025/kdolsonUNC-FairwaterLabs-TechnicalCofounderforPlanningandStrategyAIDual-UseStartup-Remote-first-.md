Fairwater Labs - Technical Cofounder for Planning and Strategy AI Dual-Use Startup - Remote-first - Full-Time - Competitive salary and significant equity (US authorized only)

Help us reinvent how military and civilian teams plan complex operations. We’re building an AI copilot that streamlines today’s manual, slide‑driven workflows—drafted by LLMs and refined by the user in real time. Think Cursor for strategic planning.

Why join now?

Backing from a dual‑use venture studio with multiple exits and in‑house DoD BD expertise.

Wireframes, validated user stories, and early users are ready—your code ships to real operators fast.

Founder CEO is a former Army officer and past startup‑exit founder with a full-stack developer skillset who’ll speak your language.

What you’ll do

Own the end-to-end architecture &amp; roadmap – choose the stack, design data pipelines, secure cloud infra, and React&#x2F;TypeScript front-end.

Build the MVP with the CEO, ship weekly releases, then hire and lead a small, AI-leveraged team.

Co-shape product decisions with DoD users and early commercial adopters.
You

Highly experienced full-stack&#x2F;ML engineer who can explain and defend tool choices (e.g. Python, TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript, React, LangChain, vector DBs, CI&#x2F;CD, IaC).

Proven track record shipping production LLM or search-heavy apps with polished UIs; comfortable with DevSecOps and data security (GovCloud&#x2F;IL4+ a plus).
Entrepreneur at heart—show us something you’ve built that shipped fast.

Send a brief intro (or resume if you have it) + GitHub&#x2F;portfolio to kyle@fairwaterlabs.com.
