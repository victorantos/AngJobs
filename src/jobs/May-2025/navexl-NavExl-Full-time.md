NavExl - Full Stack Engineer (C#&#x2F;.NET, Excel VSTO) - Stockholm, Sweden based &#x2F; Remote (EU hours) - Full-time - €65k&#x2F;year + equity

We&#x27;re a small team building tools to streamline workflows for professionals — think Excel superpowers for enterprise users. Clients include top consulting firms and universities. Patents pending.

Looking for an experienced dev to take ownership of our VSTO add-ins (C#&#x2F;.NET 4.8.1, WPF), deal with real-world deployment quirks (firewalls, TLS, MSI&#x2F;ClickOnce), and help us scale.

Nice to have: deep debugging chops (COM, Excel), experience distributing enterprise software (.exe licensing, obfuscation, etc).

We offer equity, flexible vacation, full hardware&#x2F;software setup, and a remote-friendly culture.
