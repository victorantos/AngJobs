Apple - Cupertino, CA - Full-time - Hybrid work (3 days in office) - Rust + Distributed Systems

We are a small international team, with members in Cupertino, CA, and London, UK. We are looking for senior software engineers to join our team. The role involves a large amount of individual responsibility and influence over the direction of a core service.

We believe in small agile teams and their ability to deliver high-quality, high-impact software. We share code ownership and knowledge through the Agile technique of pair-programming. Our codebase is written entirely in modern Rust using the latest technologies and coding practices.

The core work includes:

* Designing, implementing, and supporting highly scalable applications and web services

* Working in Rust (e.g., asynchronous (async&#x2F;await), sharing models (Sync&#x2F;Send), etc.)

* Concurrent programming (e.g., locking, memory synchronization, atomic operations, etc.)

* Distributed system concepts (e.g., distributed consensus, replication, failure detection, etc.)

This role requires working with pair programming (remote and if possible in-person) and may require occasional international travel&#x2F;transatlantic travel.
