PartsCloud - Backend Engineer - REMOTE (Europe) - Full-time

We’re looking for a Backend Engineer with data science experience to join our small team of experienced developers. You’ll work on core platform features including APIs, data pipelines, and our planning engine using Python, Django, the modern data stack, and related tools. The role is hands-on and collaborative, with opportunities to contribute across the stack and own projects end-to-end. We’re remote-first within the EU, offer a competitive salary around €75k (depending on experience), equity (VSOP), and support for personal development. Bonus points for startup experience or a background in logistics, e-commerce, or finance platforms.
