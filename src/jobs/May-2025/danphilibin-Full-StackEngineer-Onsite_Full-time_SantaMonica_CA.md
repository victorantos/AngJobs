Corner Health (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cornerhealth.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cornerhealth.com</a>) - Full-Stack Engineer - Onsite, Full-time, Santa Monica, CA

We&#x27;re a seed-stage healthcare tech startup on a mission to empower Nurse Practitioners to establish and run their own primary care practices. To do so, we&#x27;re building a suite of software that eliminates administrative burden with modern tech and AI, allowing NPs to focus on patient care. We use TypeScript, Node.js, React, and GraphQL.

We&#x27;re hiring our second engineer to work alongside our founding engineer and co-founders. You&#x27;ll integrate multiple external systems (payment processing, insurance eligibility, etc.), build internal tools accelerated by AI, and have real ownership over core parts of the product. Most important characteristics are high agency, pragmatism, and curiosity. You should be comfortable moving fast while setting up systems that can scale.

We&#x27;ve raised $7.5M from First Round Capital, Homebrew, and founders of DoorDash, Clover Health, and more. We&#x27;re expanding to 3 states this year, have a waitlist of NPs interested in joining our platform, and are the fastest growing primary care network in Arizona.
