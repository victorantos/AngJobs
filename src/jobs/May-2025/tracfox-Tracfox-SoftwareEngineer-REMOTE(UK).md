Tracfox - Software Engineer - REMOTE (UK) - Full-Time&#x2F;Flexible

Tracfox is building an AI-native compliance platform focused on financial markets and regulatory compliance automation. We are an early stage start-up, looking for software engineers to join our technical team as we bootstrap our product development and grow the company from scratch.

We believe in elegant design and clean code, and are seeking to build a culture focused on kindness, collaboration, and technical excellence, while avoiding office politics, unnecessary meetings, and corporate BS. We want to work with friendly and clever people, build interesting things, and share our successes across a hard-working team.

Current stack:

* Backend - Python (FastAPI, Pika, LangGraph)

* Frontend - Typescript (React, MUI, Vite)

* Infrastructure - Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, OpenSearch

We are remote first, accommodate flexible working, and can offer both salary and equity.
