The only conversational AI platform for Self Storage.

swivl is hiring a senior engineer to be a impact player on our engineering team. Our platform integrates various communication channels such as voice, chat, email, SMS, and other emerging channels to provide seamless interaction between businesses and their customers. As a member of our engineering team, you will have the opportunity to take on significant ownership, lead projects, and see your ideas come to life.

Weâ€™re a small, close-knit team, where everyone has a lot of autonomy and freedom to do their best work. We&#x27;re fully remote and mostly communicate via Slack &amp; Google Meet. Even though we&#x27;re remote, we do believe in-person team building is important. We try to get the whole team together at least twice per year. The location changes, so if there&#x27;s somewhere you&#x27;d like to meet, let us know!
