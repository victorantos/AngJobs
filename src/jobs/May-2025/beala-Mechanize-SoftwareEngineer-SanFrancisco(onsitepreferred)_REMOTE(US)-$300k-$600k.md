Mechanize - Software Engineer - San Francisco (onsite preferred), REMOTE (US) - $300k-$600k - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mechanize.work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mechanize.work</a>

We&#x27;re creating high-fidelity virtual work environments, benchmarks, and datasets to enable AI agents to master real-world jobs—starting with full-stack software engineering. Our mission is to develop the infrastructure that will enable the full automation of the economy.

Unlike traditional AI approaches, we&#x27;re focused on creating simulated environments that capture the full scope of what humans do at work: using computers, completing long-horizon tasks, coordinating with others, and adapting to obstacles and interruptions.

As our second full-stack engineer, you&#x27;ll:

- Build our core simulation platform (containerized environments for AI agents)

- Design realistic evaluation scenarios for software engineering tasks

- Develop consumer web apps for our environment

- Establish engineering standards, and directly shape technical direction at an early-stage startup

You might be a fit if you:

- Have 5+ years building full-stack products

- Write fluent TypeScript (React) and Python

- Are comfortable with Docker and Kubernetes-based environments

- Enjoy close user collaboration and rapid iteration

Bonus: Container orchestration, developer tools, or ML&#x2F;RL experience.
