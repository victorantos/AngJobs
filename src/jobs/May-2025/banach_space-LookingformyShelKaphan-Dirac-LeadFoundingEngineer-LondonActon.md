Looking for my Shel Kaphan - Dirac - Lead Founding Engineer - London Acton

Dirac is going to displace Amazon in e-commerce, and I’m looking for a suitably ambitious partner in crime to take us from series seed to A and beyond.

You’ll be building price&#x2F;demand estimators, AI agents to run operations, helping our two excellent (but inexperienced) devs, running our systemd, doing dbadmin work, our stock backend etc.

Investors include will thorndike, charlie songhurst, patio11, backedvc

email ethan [at] dirac [dot] software if interested - don’t forget to include a favourite bit of coding&#x2F;maths&#x2F;engineering, a book recommendation and an interesting pun. Visa sponsorship possible!
