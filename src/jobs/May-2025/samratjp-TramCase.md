Tram Case - Hiring Tech Lead, Backend, Full Stack &amp; AI Engineers - Remote (LATAM Latin America Only) (Spanish &amp; English required)

We’re building AI-powered tools to help law firms work faster, smarter, and with less busywork.

Our first module is an AI call center that transcribes and classifies calls to help teams prioritize urgent cases. But that’s just one part — we’re building an end-to-end platform that automates the entire case lifecycle, from intake to resolution.

We’re a small, senior team based in LATAM. You’ll be working directly with the founders and building features from scratch. No layers of approval, no legacy code — just thoughtful product work, shipped fast.

If you&#x27;re excited about solving real problems, working closely with strong engineers, and being part of something early (but real), we’d love to hear from you.

Our tech stack is: Python, Javascript&#x2F;TypeScript, and ML&#x2F;AI pipelines in AWS.
