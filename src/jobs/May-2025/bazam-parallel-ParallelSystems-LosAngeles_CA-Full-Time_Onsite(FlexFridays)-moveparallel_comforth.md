Parallel Systems - Los Angeles, CA - Full-Time, Onsite (Flex Fridays)- moveparallel.com for the company - Hiring multiple skillsets

We just closed our Series B ($38M) round and are a company focused on bringing electric and autonomous solutions to the railroad. Our team is based out of the Arts District in LA and total about 30 strong.

Members of our team can expect a high level of ownership and innovation to come to the table. We&#x27;re fundamentally changing how the railroad is perceived and migrating freight from trucking to rail. This requires a high level of creativity to adopt legacy systems to modern solutions.

Our team primarily uses Rust and are looking for a few strong software engineers to support enterprise application development, telemetry from the vehicle, and perception&#x2F;autonomy of the rail.
