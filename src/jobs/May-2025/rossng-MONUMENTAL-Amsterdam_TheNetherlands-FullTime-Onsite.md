MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite

We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.

Building a robot like this means solving all sorts of interesting challenges: figuring out the robot&#x27;s position with sub-mm precision; navigating autonomously around the building site; automating measurement and calibration of new robots; lots of distributed systems and so on.

Our robots are now continuously deployed on customer sites and we are earning real money as a masonry contractor. The full team is more than 50 people and we&#x27;re growing rapidly to meet demand.

Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.

Some open roles:

- Software Engineer, Controls

- Software Engineer, Machine Vision

- Assembly&#x2F;manufacturing technicians and robot operators

P.S. We&#x27;re always on the lookout for very strong generalist engineers who can operate at any layer of the stack (firmware, networking, UI, application code - whatever&#x27;s needed!) Drop me an email if this sounds like you.
