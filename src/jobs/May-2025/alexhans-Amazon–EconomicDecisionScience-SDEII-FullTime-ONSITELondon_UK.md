Amazon – Economic Decision Science - SDE II - Full Time - ONSITE  London, UK

We’re hiring a Software Development Engineer for our team at Amazon: Economic Decision Science (London, UK).

We&#x27;re working in an extremely interesting space at the Intersection of Economics, Machine Learning, Statistics and Data Engineering, shaping how our stores operate and evolve.

Come help us build our Factory of Economics, where economists can operate independently and in parallel, unconstrained by tech bottlenecks or engineering bandwidth. The goal: No software rewrites, predictable time to production, early integration, and fast iteration.

About the team:
- AWS resources at our disposal, with no red tape. We invest to add value. Fast.

- Zero-ops mindset. We build in a way we can focus on delivery, not maintenance.

- No on-call. No phone paging.

- Lean and pragmatic: No stand-ups or sprints; we work towards clear, business-aligned quarterly goals.

- Greenfield projects and a focus on simple solutions for complex domains.

- Tech stack includes Python, Airflow, DBT, Spark, Iceberg, SageMaker, Lambda, and Bedrock – but we always use the right tool for the job.
