Rightfoot - Onsite San Francisco - Full-Time - ~$170k - Sales!

We are looking for our first Salesperson to join our team! We need someone who is able to get their hands dirty in cold outbound as well as being able to be flexible enough to adapt with a small (9 people) startup. Working at a company our stage, ideally as the first AE or similar role is ideal.

Rightfoot is building the first customer-permissioned financial data platform that does not require end customers to share their bank usernames and passwords.  The power of our product is that it both decreases friction in the user experience and increases financial access. Today, lenders leverage Rightfoot to slash failed payments and subsequent bank fees to their end customers, seamlessly monitor customer accounts, increase collections, and more.
