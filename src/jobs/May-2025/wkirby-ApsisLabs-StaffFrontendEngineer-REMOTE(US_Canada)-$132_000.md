Apsis Labs - Staff Frontend Engineer - REMOTE (US, Canada) - $132,000 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apsis.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apsis.io</a>

Seeking a skilled frontend-focused full-stack engineer who thrives on building beautiful and functional user interfaces, but still feels comfortable on the back-end.

While we’re looking for developers with strong technical skills we don’t typically hire for experience in a particular framework or technology. We’re mostly seeking generalists that enjoy working in new technical stacks and have exceptional communication skills; because we’re a small company, everyone here takes on a lot of roles, and strong relationships with our clients are essential to our success.

We offer a 20-hour work week, retirement and health benefits, a competitive salary, an unlimited vacation and parental leave policy. You can read more on our work philosophy here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apsis.io&#x2F;mission" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apsis.io&#x2F;mission</a>.

If you&#x27;re interested, please reach out to us with any questions or with your resume at contact@apsis.io.
