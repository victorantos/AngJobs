We’re building an AI-powered clinic assistant that actually gets things done—booking appointments, managing vaccine records, handling FAQs, and even sounding like the clinic itself. This is multi-modal AI in the real world, not a demo.

Engineering
We’re looking for product-minded engineers who want to push the boundaries of generative AI, RAG, and intelligent automation. You’ll ship fast, solve real user problems, and help us make AI feel magical, not clunky.

Tech stack: TypeScript, NestJS, React, React Native, AWS, Figma.
Bonus: AI experience, but what matters most is product intuition and the drive to build useful things.

Customer Success Manager &amp; Implementation Specialist
You’ll be the front line helping clinics onboard to PetsApp—configuring integrations, migrating data, and training teams. This is a role for someone operationally excellent, customer-oriented, and eager to work hands-on with real users.

PetsApp is redefining pet care in a hybrid physical-digital world. Join us and work on AI that directly impacts clinics, pet owners, and their pets—every day.
