Ascertain - NYC (Hybrid ~3d&#x2F;week) - Full-time - $180k–$280k + equity - Healthcare AI - Senior Engineers: Backend, Frontend, AI

Ascertain is a healthcare AI startup backed by Northwell (New York&#x27;s largest health system) and Deerfield. We&#x27;re a small team automating the painful admin work that clogs up the U.S. healthcare system — things like prior authorizations, discharge planning, and insurance claims. Our goal is simple: give time back to clinicians so they can focus on patient care, not paperwork.

We&#x27;ve found early product-market fit and are growing the team thoughtfully. We&#x27;re hiring senior engineers across the stack: backend, frontend, and AI&#x2F;LLM. We&#x27;re NYC-based and hybrid (most of us come in ~3 days&#x2F;week). We&#x27;re not counting badge swipes — we just want teammates who want to be in the room with us often enough to build trust, have fun, and work on hard problems together!

What we&#x27;re building:

* A general-purpose automation platform for healthcare ops, powered by LLMs

* A system that reads unstructured documents, fills out payer forms, and explains rejections

* Tools to automate patient discharge planning in hospitals

* A foundation for making AI in healthcare safe, observable, and human-in-the-loop

What we&#x27;re looking for:

* AI Engineer — experience productionizing LLM apps (agents, RAG, embeddings); solid Python; knows how to build ML systems that ship

* Backend Engineer — strong Python&#x2F;FastAPI; infra-savvy (K8s, Terraform, Docker); thoughtful about API design and scalability

* Frontend Engineer — React&#x2F;TypeScript expert who&#x27;s opinionated about UX and happy to dip into backend when needed

More importantly, we&#x27;re looking for engineers who like open-ended, ambiguous challenges, and want to work with a tight-knit, high-trust team to solve real-world problems.
