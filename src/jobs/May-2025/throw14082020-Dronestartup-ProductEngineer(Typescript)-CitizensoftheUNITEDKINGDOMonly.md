Drone startup - Product Engineer (Typescript) - 1 day&#x2F;week in the office (London, UK) - Citizens of the UNITED KINGDOM only

You&#x27;d be working with engineers who previously worked at Google, Amazon, Helsing, Darktrace and an F1 team. We build drones (software and hardware)

We&#x27;re looking for engineers that straddle real world problems, and use technology as a solution. We prefer personal projects or relevant hobbies, not hard leetcode questions. We value collaboration: pair programming, discussing, teaching and learning from others. We&#x27;re looking for mission-driven engineers. People who see problems in the world and want to help solve them.

You&#x27;d be working with me to build the most intuitive, performant, and modern mission planning and flight monitoring software for drones, and related applications (tools for drone design and manufacturing). For my project, we use React, Tailwind, Node, drizzle-orm, Postgres, SQLite, deck.gl, Python, FastAPI, asyncio, and more. You&#x27;re allowed (and compensated) to use AI services.

Because we are a small team, you will be noticed and rewarded for performance.

*Please don’t apply if any of these resonate:*

• You prefer narrow ownership—“I only touch the backend or the code I&#x27;ve written”.

• You think it&#x27;s more about &quot;who you know, not what you know&quot;.

• You haven’t actively learned a new tool or hobby in the last year.

If interested, email my temporary email: hn-may25@mail.orth.uk with your CV and some personalised information about why you&#x27;d be the right fit.
