Sourcegraph - San Francisco - Full-Time - SWE, Forward Deployed Eng, Solutions Eng, Dev Advocate (all roles write code) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcegraph.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcegraph.com</a>

Sourcegraph is hiring software engineers and forward deployed engineers to industrialize software development with AI. Our customers are the most important organizations in the world, including Stripe, Palantir, 4&#x2F;6 top US banks, 7&#x2F;10 top software companies, and many parts of the US government and military.

Everything is changing about how software is built. Over the last few months, our AI went from writing 43% of customer code across the board to 85%+ with our unconstrained, cost-is-no-object AI coding agents. We build exclusively for the organizations with requisite scale and budget for automation; some devs incur more than $4500&#x2F;month, and thatâ€™s just the beginning.

Sourcegraph is backed by Sequoia, a16z, Redpoint, and Goldcrest.
