Purplefish - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purplefish.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purplefish.com&#x2F;careers</a> - Member of Technical Staff - Full-Time - ONSITE - New York, NY, USA - NextJS, Typescript, Python - $150k-$225k + 0.5%+

Purplefish is transforming the trillion-dollar talent industry with powerful AI agents that will fully automate most hiring processes end-to-end.

We are funded by 8VC, and Adam and I previously worked closely together to launch 145 companies at the venture studio Fractal Software out of a $650 million fund. Before that I was a staff software engineer at Lyft, and Adam was CRO at Wunderkind ($100m+ ARR). We&#x27;ve built a powerful voice agent, and are expanding into other parts of the sourcing-to-onboarding flow. We have customers, revenue is growing, and so is our team.

We&#x27;re currently a team of 3 engineers in NYC (9 people total). We&#x27;re working on really cool problems with multimodal AI agents (and some really not cool problems like ATS and HRIS integrations). I&#x27;m trying to build the engineering team that I would want to join, which to me means a high emphasis on agency, purpose, technical excellence, collaboration, learning and velocity. Recently A16Z mentioned us in the state of voice AI report: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;ai-voice-agents-2025-update&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;ai-voice-agents-2025-update&#x2F;</a>

We&#x27;re building on LiveKit&#x27;s agents framework, Python, and NextJS. We&#x27;re having a lot of fun and having real positive impact on our customers&#x27; businesses.
