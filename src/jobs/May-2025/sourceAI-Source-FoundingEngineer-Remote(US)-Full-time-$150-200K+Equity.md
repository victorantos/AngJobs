Source - Founding Engineer - Remote (US) - Full-time - $150-200K + Equity

====== What we&#x27;re building &amp; role:

Source (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getsource.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getsource.ai</a>) is building middleware and tools to help creators protect, structure, and trace their content across the web and AI systems. We&#x27;re blending cybersecurity, web infrastructure, and adversarial LLM research to give creators control — and make their work more valuable to models via ontologies, enrichment, and agent-aware metadata. We&#x27;re VC backed and looking for a Founding Engineer (full-stack or backend-leaning) who’s excited about the future of the creator economy, adversarial AI, and secure, content-aware infrastructure.

====== Stack:

Python (PyTorch, HF Transformers, Pillow, Selenium&#x2F;Chromium, Puppeteer, Playwright)

Next.js + TypeScript

Edge compute (Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge)

LLM ontologies, KGs, RAG &#x2F; VectorDBs, JSON-LD, CodeAgents, MCP

If you’re into building systems that stand up for creators and enrich content for the age of AI, we’d love to talk.
