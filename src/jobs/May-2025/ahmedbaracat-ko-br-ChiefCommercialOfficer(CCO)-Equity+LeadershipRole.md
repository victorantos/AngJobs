ko-br - Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) - Europe&#x2F;London (preferred) - Equity + Leadership Role

We’re ko-br – a London-based AI robotics startup on a mission to end the &quot;3AM cobot meltdown&quot; in warehouses. Our robots handle real-world chaos (grip slips, conveyor jams, dust storms) through:

* No-code AI that plugs into ABB&#x2F;KUKA&#x2F;UR arms

* Self-recovery protocols proven to reduce emergency calls by 85%

* Human-taught systems that turn warehouse teams into robot mentors

Why This Matters

Industrial robots keep failing when faced with mixed SKUs or shifted pallets. We’re fighting this $35B conformity crisis (see manifesto) by building robots that adapt to humans – not the other way around.

We Need You If You’ve…

* Scaled commercial ops in industrial tech&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;AI

* Closed 6-7 figure deals within the logistics space

* Built partner ecosystems around OEMs like ABB&#x2F;KUKA

* Crave building vs. babysitting (this is hands-on founding role)

Founding Team

* Founder: Ex-Amazon&#x2F;Meta ML engineer, expertise in ML infrastructure, computer vision, distributed systems, and building Internet-scale ML pipelines.

* Team: 40+ years combined expertise in VR, ML, robotics, MLOps, data annotation and cybersecurity
