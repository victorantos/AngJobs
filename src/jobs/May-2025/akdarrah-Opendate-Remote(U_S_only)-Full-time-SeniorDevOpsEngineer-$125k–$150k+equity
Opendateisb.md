Opendate - Remote (U.S. only) - Full-time - Senior DevOps Engineer - $125k–$150k + equity
Opendate is building modern ticketing software for independent music venues. Think Shopify for venues — tools that help operators sell more tickets, streamline workflows, and provide a better experience for fans.

We’re a small, fast-moving team used by a growing number of venues across the U.S. You’d be the first full-time DevOps hire, taking ownership of CI&#x2F;CD, AWS infrastructure, observability, incident response, and helping shape how we scale our Rails + React platform.

Stack: AWS (Fargate, RDS, CloudFront), Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, Ruby on Rails, React

You: 5–10+ years experience in cloud infrastructure and automation, strong with Terraform and AWS, and excited about owning DevOps end-to-end at a startup with strong product-market fit.
