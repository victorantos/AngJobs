Puma.tech - Remote-first with PST overlap - iOS&#x2F;MacOS, Android, Ai&#x2F;ML, Growth - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puma.tech</a>

Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma.tech. Previously worked  as software engineer &amp; developer advocate at Cloudant (YC S08, Acq. by IBM), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11, Facebook&#x2F;Meta), and explored Ai&#x2F;ML (computer vision for self-driving cars).

We believe in bringing more control and privacy to Ai products and are exploring a few directions:

1. Built in Local LLMs in Puma Browser for iOS and Android.

2. Crypto&#x2F;stablecoin payments for LLM usage &#x2F; Ai agents.

3. Puma Ai for MacOS – simplified LM Studio native Mac app.

4. Ways to train Ai agents on mobile web games.

If any of the above excites you please reach out.

We’ve raised a few rounds from some of the best builders in crypto and Ai:

Protocol Labs (S14), Chris Larsen (Ripple),  Don Ho (Orange DAO, Quantstamp W18), Toly (Solana), Illia Polosukhin (NEAR Protocol), Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake CEO, Neeva, Greylock), Jason Warner (poolside.ai, ex-GitHub CTO) and more.

We value Optimism, Kindness, Curiosity, Speed and Grit.
