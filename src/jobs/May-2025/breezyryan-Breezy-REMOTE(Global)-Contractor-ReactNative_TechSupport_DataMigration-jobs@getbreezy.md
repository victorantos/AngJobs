Breezy - REMOTE (Global) - Contractor - React Native, Tech Support, Data Migration - jobs@getbreezyapp.com

We’re Breezy — a product-focused, early-stage startup building modern software for Residential HVAC contractors. Think of us as the scrappy alternative to ServiceTitan or Housecall Pro. We’re a small, fast-moving team that loves to ship great product and solve real problems for hardworking pros.

We’re hiring for a few key contract roles, all remote:

1. Senior React Native Engineer
Help us replatform from PWA to React Native and build a best-in-class local-first field service management app. You’ll work closely with the CTO and product team. Strong experience with React Native and mobile architecture required. $60–$100&#x2F;hr depending on experience.

2. Tech Support Specialist (US hours)
Support our customers and internal team across Tier 1–3 issues. Must be comfortable digging into code, writing scripts, and fixing bugs. Great opportunity for someone high-potential looking to grow into a dev role over time. TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, React stack. Work hours must overlap with 9am–4pm ET. $25–$35&#x2F;hr depending on experience.

3. Data Migration Specialist
Help us onboard new customers by extracting and transforming data from legacy systems into Breezy. You’ll collaborate closely with the team to write scripts, clean and map data, and ensure successful go-lives. Strong SQL and scripting skills required. Experience with ETL workflows a big plus.
$25–$40&#x2F;hr depending on experience.

All roles are contract-based, with potential to convert to full-time depending on performance and company needs. We’re collaborative, remote-first, and deeply customer-obsessed. If you’re scrappy, product-minded, and love building things that matter, shoot us a note: jobs@getbreezyapp.com
