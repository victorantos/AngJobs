=========== What we are looking for ===========

- You&#x27;ve done Kubernetes the hard way - or better yet, you know what it is, but you&#x27;ve spent more time working with Kubernetes in production than reading about it.

- You have development experience.  We write code on top of the Kubernetes API so being able to dive deep into code is extremely valuable!
