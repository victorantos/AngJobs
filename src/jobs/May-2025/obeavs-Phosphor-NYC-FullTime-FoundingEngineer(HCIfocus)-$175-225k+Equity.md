Phosphor - NYC - Full Time - Founding Engineer (HCI focus) - $175-225k + Equity

Phosphor enables the development of the built world (e.g. from real estate to energy projects) to be managed agentically by building programming languages and observability primitives (like version control) on top of a hypergraph.

Our primary technical bet is that if you capture annotated &quot;diffs&quot; of user information with the appropriate annotation, you can create path-dependence to train AI models in an AlphaGo like context. By doing so, we achieve agentic experiences for markets that have never even had an opportunity to imagine what life would be like with basic observability.

Our product is similar a combination of Linear and Wolfram, with components and objects that enable advanced financial modeling, legal&#x2F;regulatory analysis, and geospatial analysis of infrastructure development opportunities.

We&#x27;re in stealth, but recently venture-backed by one of the best deeptech funds in the market. We&#x27;re hiring for a few roles at the senior&#x2F;staff levels:
1. HCI Engineer - You&#x27;re a prosemirror wizard who probably follows Ink &amp; Switch or the UCSB HCI lab on Twitter; front-end&#x2F;rich-text&#x2F;typescript focused; lots of architectural&#x2F;sync engine work
2. Systems&#x2F;Compiler Engineer - We design and build dev tools for languages we create that compile into various graph representations. These range from financial modeling calcs (which need to go very fast to support a seamless UX), to computable representations of legal agreements. Extra points if you&#x27;ve worked with hypergraphs. This in Rust but we&#x27;re exploring a few other languages.

Email resume&#x2F;linkedin&#x2F;twitter to oliver@phosphor.co if you might fit somewhere in here, or if you&#x27;ve taken a credible attempt at building end-user programming tools.
