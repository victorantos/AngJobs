We&#x27;re building the first end to end web scraping platform powered by AI. We help businesses collect web data without the hassle of maintaining code, infra, and anti-bot evasions.

We&#x27;re a small team of four that recently raised a seed round from leading VCs and angels to keep up with revenue growth. We ship fast and have signed up several enterprise customers including the largest hedge funds in the world in less than a year. This is an opportunity to join at the ground floor of a product that will be used by thousands of enterprises.

I&#x27;m Rohit, one of the founders - if interested, apply here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;string-ai.notion.site" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;string-ai.notion.site</a>) and mention this post.
