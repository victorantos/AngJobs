Riza - San Francisco - Full-Time - System, Backend, and Full-Stack Engineers - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riza.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riza.io</a>

We provide isolated runtimes for executing untrusted code, mostly generated by LLMs. Our sandboxing is powered by a combination of WebAssembly, V8, and microVMs. Our customers do things like extract data from log lines at run time by asking claude-3-7-sonnet to generate a parsing function on-the-fly and then sending it to us for execution.

Things we need help with:

- Our API (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.riza.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.riza.io&#x2F;</a>) (Postgres &#x2F; Go)

- Our account dashboard (Postgres &#x2F; Go &#x2F; React &#x2F; TypeScript)

- Our code execution engine (Go &#x2F; Rust)

- New products including code generation workflows (Anthropic &#x2F; OpenAI experience a plus)

We’ve raised seed money, but the whole company is currently just me, Andrew and David working out of a converted warehouse on Alabama St. We’re second-time founders, so we know the risk we’re asking you to take and we’re prepared to compensate accordingly.
