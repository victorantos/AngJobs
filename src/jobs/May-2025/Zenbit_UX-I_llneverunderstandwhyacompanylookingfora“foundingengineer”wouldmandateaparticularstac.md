I’ll never understand why a company looking for a “founding engineer” would mandate a particular stack…

You either trust the “founding” candidate to be a founding engineer and therefore trust their judgment or you want a regular engineer to continue with whatever jank the founders hacked together and the “founding” title is meaningless.
