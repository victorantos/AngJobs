CLUTCH - Backend Reliability Engineer - Barcelona, Spain &#x2F; REMOTE - Full-time

Clutch is building an AI camera for racket sports courts and an app where players can view AI-generated video highlights and game analysis. Like a Strava for racket sports (computer vision instead of GPS). Our initial focus is on the world&#x27;s fastest growing sport: padel. In just 4 short months since launch, weâ€™ve rolled out the Clutch Cam in partnership with several high-level clubs and investors, from the US to Europe to the Middle East.

We&#x27;re looking for a cracked engineer who likes to take ownership and shape the company that they&#x27;re working in. You&#x27;ll be working with a small but excellent tech team (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clutchapp.io&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clutchapp.io&#x2F;about</a>). If you also want to track your performance on court that&#x27;s great but not a requirement.
