Equity Trust Company - Analytics Engineer - Cleveland, Ohio or Remote (US) - Full-time - Financial Services

Equity Trust is a custodian of self-directed IRAs that gives clients the tools to manage their own retirement accounts, and to invest in a range of traditional and alternative assets. We have been helping clients steer their own retirement accounts for over 50 years, and now have over 400,000 accounts, and over $65 billion in assets, under custody. We have offices in Ohio, Florida, Texas, and South Dakota if in-person work is your jam, but fully support remote work as well.

The role: We&#x27;re a team of 6, looking to add a new analytics engineer who will work across our stack (mostly Python, Typescript, AWS) to architect and build out a modern data stack to support operational, reporting, and machine learning use cases across the business. Our work is a mix of API development, data pipelines, the occasional ML side quest or two, and building out the infrastructure to reliably and scalably power it all. Generally, if you like working with data, tackling open-ended problems, and (optionally, but always nice) building cool products to help folks take a more active role in their investments --- you&#x27;ll probably have a good time here!
