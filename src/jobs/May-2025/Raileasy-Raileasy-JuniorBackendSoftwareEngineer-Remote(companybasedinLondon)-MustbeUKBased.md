Raileasy - Junior Backend Software Engineer - Remote (company based in London) - Permanent&#x2F;PAYE - Must be UK Based

Ever wanted to work in the UK rail-ticketing retail space?

Raileasy, who own and operate the TrainSplit brand, are hiring for a junior backend software engineer.

Our API powers some of the most established and recognisable brands in the independent rail retail space (particularly where split-ticketing is involved) such as TrainSplit, Realtime Tickets from Realtime Trains, Split My Fare, Railboard and others. We provide both B2C and B2B ticket booking services. We are a remote-first organisation; we have engineers in a variety of locations across the UK, but we make good use of pair programming, video conferencing, asynchronous communication and in-person meet-ups at mutually accessible locations to collaborate.

We’re looking for someone UK-based who will be able to work on our .NET-based services, primarily in C# – but we have a variety of smaller services written in languages like Golang and Rust too. This role would be ideal for someone who has recently graduated from e.g. a CS course, or has taught themselves how to program and now has a decent grasp on the fundamentals. Any internships, placement years and&#x2F;or open source contributions&#x2F;repositories (even if it&#x27;s just a few Advent of Code days) you could show us would reflect well on your application.

An interest in public transport&#x2F;rail would be a plus, but is by no means a requirement.

For more information about the role and our API’s architecture, please see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raileasy.co.uk&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raileasy.co.uk&#x2F;careers</a> and the full specification at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raileasy.co.uk&#x2F;backend-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raileasy.co.uk&#x2F;backend-engineer</a>

For questions send us an email to careers AT trainsplit.com. To apply, email a copy of your CV to the same email address.

No agencies, please and unfortunately, we are unable to accept applications from candidates who do not have the right to work in the UK.
