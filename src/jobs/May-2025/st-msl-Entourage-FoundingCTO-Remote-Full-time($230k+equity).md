Entourage - Founding CTO - Remote - Full-time ($230k+ equity)

We&#x27;re building the protocol layer for collective AI agent intelligence. Our core insight is enabling mutually distrusting agents to exchange and validate experiences via a shared memory layer, transforming isolated learning into compounded network intelligence (think Git&#x2F;OSS for agent experiences). This is crucial infrastructure for the future agent economy. Incubated by Moonsong Labs (Kluster.ai, Moonbeam, Tanssi).

Seeking a hands-on, visionary CTO &amp; Co-founder to architect our system (AI, distributed systems, data, infra), build the founding engineering team, and drive technical strategy. This involves deep work in multi-agent systems, collective learning, secure execution, and potentially novel consensus&#x2F;incentive mechanisms.

Must have: Proven leadership in AI infra (CTO&#x2F;VP&#x2F;Founder&#x2F;Lead Scientist). Expertise in GenAI&#x2F;RL&#x2F;DL&#x2F;MLOps&#x2F;PyTorch. Experience with agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, etc.) and distributed&#x2F;federated AI concepts. MSc required, PhD strongly preferred. Strategic thinker passionate about building developer ecosystems.

Nice to have: Blockchain&#x2F;Web3&#x2F;tokenomics experience.

Shape the future of agent collaboration: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;moonsong-labs&#x2F;a094e9ba-0beb-405c-9cda-4bb41cd03c96" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;moonsong-labs&#x2F;a094e9ba-0beb-405c-9cda-...</a>
