Paytient is on a mission to help people better access and afford care.

We partner will employers and health plans to offer zero-fee, zero-interest payment flexibility for out-of-pocket healthcare costs.

We&#x27;re hiring several full-stack software engineers, as well as a senior cloud security engineer (with GCP expertise). Our roles support fully remote work, and we have a home office in Columbia, MO for those located in the area.

Our tech stack leverages a lot of the modern technologies you&#x27;d expect of a Series B, high-growth startup, including Kotlin and React&#x2F;React Native, built on top of the AWS cloud (with GCP for some critical business functions).
