Phaselaw - San Francisco - Hybrid - Full Time - Founding Product Engineer

We&#x27;re a Seed-stage legal tech startup working to eliminate manual doc review, the most hated part of every lawyer&#x27;s early career.

Our founding team is highly experienced (I was CTO of a large analytics company through its successful exit; our CTO was a Staff Data Engineer at Reddit and his two prior companies had successful exits; our COO was the COO of an MIT Media Lab spinoff and head of product at a number of early stage startups). And although it&#x27;s very much the early days of the business, our product is the best in the world at its particular niche and we already have about 20 paid customers including legal teams at some of the largest companies in the world.

We&#x27;re looking for someone who is focused on the frontend (NextJS) but can flex across the stack â€” it would be delightful if you were comfortable dropping into the backend (Python&#x2F;FastAPI&#x2F;Postgres&#x2F;EKS) and even more delightful if you were comfortable making design decisions since we&#x27;re early enough we don&#x27;t have a designer on staff. More important than any particular technical skill, we&#x27;re looking for someone who has a strong product sense and is motivated by customer problems, who has strong accountability, and who is excited to be hire #2 at a rapidly growing company with all of the chaos and opportunities for growth that come with that.
