Fullstory - Atlanta or Remote (US) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;</a>

Fullstory provides privacy-preserving session replay and analytics for websites and mobile apps. Our session replays are nothing short of magical - they look almost like a video of the user&#x27;s screen - and the combination with analytics creates eye-opening insights.

We have two engineering roles open:

* Senior Software Engineer, iOS - Objective-C, Rust, small amounts of Swift, and other languages. Note that we&#x27;re not building apps. It&#x27;s about taking things apart, seeing what makes them tick, and figuring out how to extract the data we need without negatively impacting the app experience. (Or using any private APIs!) It&#x27;s part reverse engineering, part systems programming, and part library development. - $176,000 to $207,500 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;ab3f8ecb-ee1f-4431-a05e-b333c8589a8a&#x2F;?ashby_jid=ab3f8ecb-ee1f-4431-a05e-b333c8589a8a&amp;utm_source=092xpqyAkV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;ab3f8ecb-ee1f-4431-a0...</a>

* Senior Software Engineer, Application Experience - TypeScript, React, Go (Golang). Our customers love Fullstory, and part of that is because of the application experience. You&#x27;ll be working on the features, workflows, UX, and design system - $160,000 to $190,000 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1a014b19-d805-4547-9ad5-d4c2c6fb8277&#x2F;?ashby_jid=1a014b19-d805-4547-9ad5-d4c2c6fb8277&amp;utm_source=092xpqyAkV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1a014b19-d805-4547-9a...</a>

...and a few roles in other categories, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;</a> for the full list and some general info.

In addition to the listed pay ranges, you can expect regular raises &amp; bonuses, equity, and benefits including: health insurance, 401k matching (Vanguard), annual learning stipend, unlimited PTO, and more. I take about 5 weeks vacation a year, in addition to ~3 weeks worth of company holidays (federal holidays + the week of Christmas to New Years.)

You also get a 5-week sabbatical after 5 years of employment - I just took mine at the end of last year, and it was fantastic.
