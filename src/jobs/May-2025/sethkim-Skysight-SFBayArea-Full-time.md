Skysight - Infrastructure&#x2F;LLMs &amp; Research Engineering - SF Bay Area - Full-time

We are building large-scale batch inference infrastructure and a great&#x2F;user developer experience around it. We believe LLMs have not yet been meaningfully unlocked as data processing tools - we&#x27;re changing that.

Our work involves interesting distributed systems and LLM research problems, newly-imagined user experiences, and a meaningful focus on mission and values.

Open Roles:
