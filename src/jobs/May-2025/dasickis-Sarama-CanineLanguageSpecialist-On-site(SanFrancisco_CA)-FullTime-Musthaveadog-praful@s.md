Sarama - Canine Language Specialist - On-site (San Francisco, CA) - Full Time - Must have a dog - praful@sarama.ai

Company: We’re building smart collars and devices to decode dog communication—using audio, motion, and behavior data. Our goal is to understand what our dogs are trying to say and rethink the worlds of training, healthcare, and companionship as we uncover their language. We&#x27;ve trained models for dog vocalizations and movement patterns, and now we’re integrating behavior and intent.

Role: You’ll work closely with our engineering team to help ground our models in real-world behavior. From structured training sessions to experimental communication techniques (e.g. dog buttons, symbolic vocalization training), your work will directly shape how our devices interpret canine communication. You&#x27;ll guide the design of training protocols, data collection, and help teach dogs how to speak using structured methods.

You:

+ Experience in dog cognition, vocalization, and training techniques.

+ Familiar with AAC devices or button-based communication systems.

+ Scientific mindset with hands-on experience.

+ Passionate about language and cross-species understanding.

+ Must have a dog (ideally one you’ve trained using vocal cues or buttons)

Apply: Send us an email with a video or write-up of your past work (bonus if it includes your dog using buttons or vocal cues) to hello@sarama.ai with subject: “{Your dog’s name} wants {something they want}.” In the body, tell us what interspecies communication means to you.

If you refer someone to us, tell them to let us know and we&#x27;ll send you a gift! (we aren&#x27;t able to give a cash bonus just yet soon though)
