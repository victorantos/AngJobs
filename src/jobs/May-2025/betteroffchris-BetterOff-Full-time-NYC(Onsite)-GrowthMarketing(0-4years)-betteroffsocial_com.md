Better Off - Full-time - NYC (Onsite) - Growth Marketing (0-4 years) - betteroffsocial.com

Hiring junior growth marketer @ Better Off in IRL Social space.

--

Exec summary: Better Off is a marketplace for social experiences that connects users with the events and people they want to meet + gives experience creators the tools to start and scale. Similar to Amazon but for experiences&#x2F;people, not products.

We use neural networks to match users groups they want to meet, and host experiences on our platform like huge brunches, trivia nights, ski trips, sports leagues, sushi-making classes, run clubs, etc.  It&#x27;s a fun way to meet new people outside of work &amp; dating apps.
