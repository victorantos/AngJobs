Ameba - Full-stack Engineer + Applied AI Engineer - London - On-site - £100-130k + Equity

Engineering at Ameba is a rare opportunity to build cutting-edge software in a traditional industry, while being generously rewarded for your contributions.

If you’ve never considered working in supply chains before, everything around you, including the device you&#x27;re reading this on, has a story of how it got there. Raw material to finished product, that story is the supply chain. If the unseen machinery of the world sparks something in you, we&#x27;d love to talk!

We&#x27;re a startup made up of experienced entrepreneurs (who have previously raised $160m+) and builders (ex-Meta, Palantir, Microsoft, Quant Devs, UnlikelyAI). We have big ambitions and are backed by some of the most successful investors in Europe. Since launching just over a year ago, we’ve raised more than $9M and are already working with some of Europe&#x27;s biggest brands — and things are only just getting started.
