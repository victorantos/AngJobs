Ichi - Remote (US) - Full-Time - Senior Software Engineer, Full Stack - LLM-powered construction code compliance

Ichi is building an AI-powered professional toolset to transform construction permitting and code compliance. We&#x27;re helping municipalities, plan examiners, architects, and construction professionals streamline the permitting process to reduce bottlenecksâ€”ultimately accelerating construction timelines in an $11T global industry.

We&#x27;re a small team (you == employee #6) backed by Costanoa Ventures looking for a high-ownership Senior Software Engineer (8+ years exp) who can build from scratch and deeply cares about product quality. You&#x27;ll design and implement product features that integrate intuitive UX and powerful multi-modal (and multi-model) LLM pipelines, working directly with users to refine our approach.

Tech stack: Ruby, Rails, Python, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Postgres, AWS.

Must have: Full stack experience, product intuition, and interest in LLMs.

CS degree or equivalent preferred; we work on hard problems and first-principles thinking and attention to detail are essential.

Our name &quot;Ichi&quot; (Japanese for &quot;city&quot;, and &quot;one&quot;) reflects our mission to improve the physical spaces around us through never-before-possible technology and bridging a fundamental information asymmetry.
