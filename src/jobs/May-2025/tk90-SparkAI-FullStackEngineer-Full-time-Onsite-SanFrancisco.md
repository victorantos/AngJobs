Spark AI - Full Stack Engineer - Full-time - Onsite - San Francisco

Hi HN! We’re Spark, building an AI research tool to help deploy solar farms and battery plants faster.

Turns out the biggest challenge with building more solar farms is not construction - it’s navigating local regulation. We build AI agents that help large energy developers find and understand critical information to develop and invest in energy projects.

Please reach out if you:

* Love writing code, but also care about having significant impact.

* Want to work on an AI product that helps power more homes or learn about the energy industry!

* Want to be part of an early team and shape the product and culture.

We’re funded by top investors, including AI Grant (Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross), the founders of Brex, Plaid, Helioscope (acq. Aurora Solar), and more (to be announced).
