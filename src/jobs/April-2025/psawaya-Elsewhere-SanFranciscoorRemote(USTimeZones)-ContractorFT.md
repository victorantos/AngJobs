Elsewhere - San Francisco or Remote (US Time Zones) - Contract or FT - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elsewhere.zone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elsewhere.zone</a>

Are you a web developer who’s always wanted to make indie video games? This is for you.
Elsewhere is a San Francisco-based game studio building multiplayer roguelike games. We’re working on two projects, one of which is a roguelike deck builder in the vein of great titles like Inscryption and Slay the Spire with a little Pokemon TCP and Marvel SNAP thrown in.
We’re building games with TypeScript, React, and HTML&#x2F;CSS as well as Websockets (via Colyseus). We’re using generative AI in a fascinatingly new and creative way that naturally extends game mechanics into something tens of millions of people will absolutely love.

Ideally, you:

* Have worked as a software engineer before, ideally on a small team.

* Have built and shipped games before, either professionally or on your own time.

* Love games yourself, and have always wanted to work in the games industry.

* Know the web stack (TypeScript, React, etc) like the back of your hand

We’re stealth but backed by some of the top investors in Silicon Valley, including Floodgate and a16z SPEEDRUN. My previous startup was Human Interest (YC S15), a fintech co that today is valued at $1.3B. My intention is to outdo it many times over with Elsewhere. We’re building the the Blizzard, Valve, or Nintendo for the AI age. I hope you’ll consider joining us.
