Our current stack is Ruby, Rails, MongoDB, and React.JS. We are looking for more Junior and Senior FullStack Engineers. We have an awesome work environment: We are a remote first company (before Covid!).

We do continuous integration, continuous deployments, code reviews, code pairings, profit sharing, and most of communication is async via GitHub.
