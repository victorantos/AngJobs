Ambient - Remote - Full-Time - Principal Rust Engineer, Lead AI Researcher, Principal Python Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ambient.xyz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ambient.xyz&#x2F;</a>

The world economy will be denominated in machine intelligence and Ambient is building a useful proof of work cryptocurrency network to support that, where the proof of work is verified inference, fine tuning, and pre-training on a single large language model (650b + parameters) that runs on all the nodes of our network. As a mental shorthand, imagine if Open AI was powered by AI Bitcoin instead of Azure credits and was actually open source.
