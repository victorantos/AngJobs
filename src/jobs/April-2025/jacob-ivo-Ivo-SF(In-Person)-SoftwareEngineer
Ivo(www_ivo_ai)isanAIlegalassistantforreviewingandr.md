Ivo - SF (In-Person) - Software Engineer
Ivo (www.ivo.ai) is an AI legal assistant for reviewing and redlining contracts more efficiently â€” although we primarily serve lawyers, we think we can eventually remove lawyers from contracting processes entirely. Our customers include companies like Zapier, Canva, Quora, and WordPress.

We recently raised our Series A from Costanoa Ventures, NFDG, Uncork Capital, Fika Ventures, and more.
