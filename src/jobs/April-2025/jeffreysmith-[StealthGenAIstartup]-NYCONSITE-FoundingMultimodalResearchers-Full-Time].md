[Stealth GenAI startup] - NYC ONSITE - Founding Multimodal Researchers - Full-Time]

We&#x27;re a stealth mode genAI startup working to advance the state-of-the-art in generative media. We&#x27;ve just closed our preseed round and are now backed by 3 expert VC funds and a collection of AI leader angels. Our team consists of highly experienced AI leaders from leading companies.

The roles we&#x27;re hiring for are at the boundary of fundamental and applied research on multimodal reasoning and generative media. Ideal candidates will have previous research experience in the CV&#x2F;image&#x2F;video generation domain, ideally with publications and&#x2F;or open source artifacts of this work.

This is a unique opportunity to be part of the founding researcher cohort of a deeply innovative team with a unique technology that no one else is building.
