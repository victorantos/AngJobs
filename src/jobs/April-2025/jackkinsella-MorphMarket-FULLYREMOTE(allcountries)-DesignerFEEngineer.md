MorphMarket - FULLY REMOTE (all countries) - Designer FE Engineer - 20 - 40hrs&#x2F;week

I&#x27;m the CTO of MorphMarket.com. We are an online marketplace that connects breeders and keepers of lizards, geckos, snakes, frogs, spiders and other pets. Our users passionately love the least loved animals - e.g. here&#x27;s our COO&#x27;s TikTok <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@brittniszoo&#x2F;video&#x2F;7065724911901347118" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@brittniszoo&#x2F;video&#x2F;706572491190134711...</a>

We&#x27;re looking for someone who has web design skills and ALSO enough front-end programming skills to help implement layout changes etc. into the site. The ideal candidate

- has a spider-sense for design inconsistencies (e.g. poor alignment, font mismatch etc.)

- is able to use _some_ tool to produce quick designs for feedback (we&#x27;re agnostic about which one: it could be Figma&#x2F;Sketch&#x2F;PhotoShop&#x2F;some random WireFraming tool)

- can write and debug CSS to help us implement the design into our codebase -- and also knows enough React to help move things around.

- can help our team identify our canonical UX components and our visual language and spearhead a project to produce a design inventory to help the team coordinate better on design in the future

- has opinions about what makes a good UX and notices good patterns on other websites and apps

Work culture:

- Mostly async and written communication. Our team is distributed across Europe, Asia, and USA. We don&#x27;t have common working hours, but you will need to find a way to sync up for perhaps 2 hours per day with colleagues for communications.

- Emphasis on learning and team education (e.g. here&#x27;s my own YouTube channel - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@semicolonsons" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@semicolonsons</a>) I try to keep things fun and engaging for the team.

- About 15 people on the product team and perhaps 10 staff in other roles.

- Friendly and social on Slack

- We devote every Friday to tech debt &#x2F; sharpening the saw
