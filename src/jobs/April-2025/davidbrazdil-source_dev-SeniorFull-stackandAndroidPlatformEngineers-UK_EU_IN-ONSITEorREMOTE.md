source.dev - Senior Full-stack and Android Platform Engineers - UK, EU, IN - ONSITE or REMOTE

source.dev is transforming software development and updates for the device ecosystem.

We are building an AI-native DevOpsSec platform that’s vertically integrated with device codebases, to accelerate development, reduce maintenance costs, and deliver frequent, bug-free software updates.

Our mission is to simplify the complexities of developing, deploying, and maintaining software for Android and Linux-based devices — serving everyone from System on Chip (SoC) companies to OEMs. We empower our partners to launch devices faster and maintain them for longer.

We are founded by a team of former Googlers with deep expertise in Android and Linux, and backed by leading venture capital. If you’re passionate about making a real world impact we’d love to chat to you!

We&#x27;re seeking:

- Senior Full-stack Engineer strong at Python&#x2F;FastAPI and front-end frameworks like React, Next.js. You will be responsible for building and optimizing the user-facing side of our platform, working closely with our DevOps and Platform engineers to explore possibilities and enhance existing workflows.

- Android Platform Engineer experienced with at least some of AOSP, Android frameworks, BSPs and HALs, as well as modern programming languages like Rust. You will collaborate closely with former Google Android engineers to expand Android OS tooling, from builds to testing and emulation, while integrating it with our DevOpsSec platform.

These positions offer a unique opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and be part of one of the world’s leading Android teams, providing immense potential for learning and growth.
