Join - Sr&#x2F;Staff Golang&#x2F;DB Developer - Remote (USA, Canada) - full-time - $175k â€“ $205k&#x2F;yr + equity

Hey, I&#x27;m an engineering manager at Join. We build collaboration tools for huge construction projects: think stadiums, hospitals, research facilities, etc. Our customers (GCs) love us and their customers (owners) love us so we&#x27;re getting cool network effects out of that.

I&#x27;m looking for a senior&#x2F;staff Golang&#x2F;DB developer who has a bunch of tools in their belt, knows their tradeoffs, and &#x2F;wants&#x2F; to share their knowledge with midlevels and help them avoid some of the scars you&#x27;ve accumulated over the years. :)

The full job description (along with my email) is at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.build&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers-sse&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.build&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers-sse&#x2F;</a>

If you&#x27;re curious about anything, either reply or email me.
