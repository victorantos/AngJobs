Layer - Full stack &amp; Backend Engineering - San Francisco - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerfi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerfi.com</a>

We believe SMBs are the backbone of American society and small business ownership is the best path to wealth creation and economic mobility for many Americans. We&#x27;re trying to dramatically lower the activation energy in just one of the major hurdles for aspiring small business owners: accounting and bookkeeping.

Our approach is working! We embed directly within an SMB&#x27;s primary business platform, manage all the data syncing &amp; reconciliation for them, and have real humans (with real AI tooling) handling their books. We do this at ~half the cost of existing bookkeeping services and it&#x27;s still profitable for us because we&#x27;re saving so much time with our data access + AI.

Adoption is taking off faster even faster than we hoped and we need to grow the team! We&#x27;re a team of 5 who like working with a high ownership and high throughput collaboration. We have serious technical challenges across scaling systems, data modeling, and building AI-driven automations of tedious tasks.

Our hiring philosophy is simple.

1. The early engineering team isn&#x27;t just building products, it&#x27;s setting the culture, practices, and standards for the whole org. Find teammates who have the appetite and agency to go beyond excellent code.

2. No one knows more than 10% of what they need to be successful at an early stage startup. Find teammates with the highest trajectory of learning and growth and give them as much opportunity and responsibility as they want.

3. We talk to real small businesses with real problems every single day. Find teammates who want to win by making our customers successful day in and day out.
