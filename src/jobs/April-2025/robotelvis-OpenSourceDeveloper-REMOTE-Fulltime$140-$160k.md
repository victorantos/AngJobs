New Public (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newpublic.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newpublic.org</a>) - Open Source Developer - REMOTE - Full time $140-$160k

We are working with a consortium of public broadcasters around the world to create a publicly-owned public-interest online space. This project has a lot of momentum behind it, particularly as recent political changes in the US are getting countries interested in the idea of digital sovereignty.

We have lots of people wanting to get involved in the project, and so we plan to open the project up to anyone to contribute, whether they be public media, private media, institutions, universities, or enthusiasts. To make that work well, we want to hire an open source engineer who can manage contributions, create training materials, do refactoring, manage forums, and do all the other things necessary to nurture a healthy open source community.

Particularly interested in people with experience maintaining Open Source projects and working with outside contributors.
