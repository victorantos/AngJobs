Hi, I’m Ben, CTO at Inductive Bio.

Our team (ex Google, Meta, Palantir, Genentech, Eli Lilly, etc.) is working on accelerating drug discovery by building AI algorithms on top of a unique and growing proprietary data set and making those algorithms available to scientists via a carefully-designed “copilot” software platform for molecular design. We are backed by top investors (e.g. a16z, Lux), advised by renowned drug discovery experts, and have achieved product-market fit, with rapidly growing revenue and customer adoption.

We are hiring across a number of roles, including:

- Full-stack software engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inductive-bio&#x2F;02725e91-1a91-4da7-a4bb-b8e1867c9996" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inductive-bio&#x2F;02725e91-1a91-4da7-a4...</a>

- Frontend software engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inductive-bio&#x2F;822a554b-dfa0-49cc-b6e6-f63596014a9c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inductive-bio&#x2F;822a554b-dfa0-49cc-b6...</a>

- Machine learning engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inductive-bio&#x2F;3c352919-f968-4096-af03-b5c6125142e5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;inductive-bio&#x2F;3c352919-f968-4096-af...</a>

We are a passionate, kind, and ambitious team, and we are looking for like-minded people who are excited to push the frontier of AI-guided drug discovery from both a software and ML perspective.
