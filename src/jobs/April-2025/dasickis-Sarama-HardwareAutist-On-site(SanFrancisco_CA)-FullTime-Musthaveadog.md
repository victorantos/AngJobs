Sarama - Hardware Autist - On-site (San Francisco, CA) - Full Time - Must have a dog - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sarama.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sarama.ai</a>

Company: We’re building smart collars and other devices to translate dogs into our language—using audio and motion data. We want to know what our dogs want and are on a mission to rethink the entire healthcare &amp; training industries as we better understand them. We are mostly software people and have built our own models for dogs (soon expanding to my new cats).

Role: Hardware, firmware, and software. Moving fast will be a mix of LLM, research, hacks, and rapidly typing. Build fast, no hand-holding. First product’s a warm-up. After that, it gets real.

You:
Full-stack in the real sense (hardware + firmware + software)
Fast, independent, opinionated
Move fast, care deeply
Must have a dog
Culture: Obsessed with dogs. We’re building the interface for interspecies communication. Not just “pet people”— we believe dogs are family members fully including legally (we can discuss the changes in law on our call).

Apply: Send us an email with your portfolio (or something similar) with a picture of you and your dog to hello@sarama.ai with subject “{Your dog’s name} likes {something they like}” and in the body include what this tech means to you.
