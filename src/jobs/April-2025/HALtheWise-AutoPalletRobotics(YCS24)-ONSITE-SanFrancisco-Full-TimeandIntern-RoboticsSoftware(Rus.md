AutoPallet Robotics (YC S24) - ONSITE - San Francisco - Full-Time and Intern - Robotics Software (Rust), Mechatronics Engineer, ML Intern, ??

We’re building novel robots for case picking in warehouses, a huge unsolved automation opportunity for a very labor-intensive, critically important and sh*tty human job in the thin-margin industry of logistics. Our software is all Rust&#x2F;Pytorch, embedded dev through research-frontier applied algorithms and an integrated development iteration time measured on a watch, not a calendar.

There’s more than enough fun problems to go around, and we’re looking to grow the team with a couple more great-to-work-with folks, including generalists or job descriptions we haven’t realized we should be hiring for. We’re also specifically looking for a summer applied ML intern for robotic perception and controls. There’s a lot more cool stuff we can’t share publicly just yet. To apply, email a resume to &lt;the-two-letters-of-this-site&gt;@autopallet.bot, and include the role you’re looking for in the subject line, and we’ll take it from there. Bonus points if you include a link or photo of something cool you’ve made.
