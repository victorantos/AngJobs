Natera - Full Time - Remote US - Genomics Tech

Natera develops and performs oncology, organ and women&#x27;s health genomic testing to help patients live longer and lead healthier lives.

I&#x27;m currently hiring for an L3 (mid career) and L4 (Senior SWE) on the EMR engineering team. We are in the process of modernizing the EMR platform and could use some additional help. We typically lean into NodeJS, Typescript, SQL on AWS (terraform) but you&#x27;ll work your way around a variety of codebases and technology. The day-to-day typically involves re-writing or leveling up the existing capabilities into a more resilient or scalable layer. The EMR team manages systems and software which facilitates receiving the incoming orders and outgoing results to the providers.
