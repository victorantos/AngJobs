Navico - New Zealand - Hybrid (2-3 days on-site) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.navico.com&#x2F;about-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.navico.com&#x2F;about-us</a>

We&#x27;re a leading marine electronics company developing our own hardware running an Android-based platform. We&#x27;re also developing sensors and peripherals

This particular role is unusually vertical, dealing with everything from reading sensor data on CAN (C) to business logic (C++) to publishing data via an Android library (Kotlin). We dabble in CI (Android test instrumentation &#x2F; Jenkins) and have a plethora of mini side projects. They actually make life in this team quite fun

In terms of tech stack, anything Android is what we&#x27;re looking for, with the ability to go low level (C &#x2F; C++). Understanding of networking and protocols is essential

You&#x27;ll join a team of 4 unusually skewed on the senior side. We&#x27;re pretty collaborative, so experience with pair or mob programming is welcome. Being keen on test automation is a plus. Oh, we&#x27;re Linux friendly, while staying cross-platform in terms of development

We sometimes get to test on the water

Auckland based and quite flexible - you still have to be able to be on location if need be, though. Please apply only if you&#x27;re already in NZ and willing to live in Auckland
