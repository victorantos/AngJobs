Looking for my Shel Kaphan - Dirac - Lead Founding Engineer - 5% equity + £70k base (£100k base after series A) - London, Acton - in-person only

Dirac is building the next Walmart-sized retail company over 10+ years. We sell d2c and are doing £300k-£500k monthly sales (lots of toys and reasonably seasonal). I built most the initial systems which run the company’s backend (purchasing, databases, pipelines etc.) but we will need something (and someone!) better to reach £1bn+ sales over the next four years

We need to go from a bunch of bash scripts coordinated by systemd, adhoc estimators and pipelines to a more coherent machine for demand estimation, matching products, warehousing and purchasing.

You’ll be mostly writing code (django+postgre+a hetzner server) but also helping our two more junior devs.

The vision for the company is twofold: (1) find 1000s of suppliers and wholesalers worldwide and (2) to ingest all their pricing, logistics and then move stock to where prices and demand is highest.

Visa sponsorship possible.

Investors include will thorndike, charlie songhurst, patio11, backedvc and some others!

email ethan [at] dirac [dot] software if interested!
