FinQuery - AI Engineer - REMOTE (US) or Atlanta, GA - Full-time

I&#x27;m hiring an AI&#x2F;ML engineer to join the AI&#x2F;ML team at FinQuery.

Our team creates services powered by LLMs and traditional ML to enable features across our suite of products.  Like many companies, we are trying to separate the real value of the latest AI techniques and tools from the hype (agents?), and unlocking use cases that actually benefit our customers. This role is a rather generalist role for someone with a strong ML background, 2+ years of work experience (post schooling), and a desire to work on both proof of concept and production systems. You would be joining our small AI&#x2F;ML team as we continue to automate as much as possible and enable new product features and use cases.

FinQuery makes software to help companies comply with new lease accounting regulations, manage financial contracts, and keep track of recurring and one-off payments. We&#x27;re based in Atlanta, but support fully remote employees in the US. This is an IC role.
