We are a Commercial Real Estate Financing marketplace that connects commercial mortgage brokers to lenders to make deals. We have over $40 billion of deals made through our platform to date.

We are looking for a Head of Engineering to backfill our interim fractional CTO.

Prior tech leadership experience is required.

The role is on-site in Miami, with some WFH flexibility. We are open to paying relocation for the right candidate.
