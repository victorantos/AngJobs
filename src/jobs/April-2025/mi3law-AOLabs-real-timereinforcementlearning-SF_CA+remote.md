AO Labs - real-time reinforcement learning - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aolabs.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aolabs.ai&#x2F;</a> - SF, CA + remote

AO Labs is an applied AI research lab building real-time reinforcement learning, unlocking AI that can be hyper-personalized with less data than LLMs.

Our first product is an API that learns by combining end-user context, application data, and a feedback signal (eg. an end-users&#x27; likes and dislikes) in a fast learning loop that&#x27;s lightweight enough to provision a distinct agent per-user. There&#x27;s no gap between training and inference-- train at the edge, learn all the time.

With our framework we increase training efficiency and also combine the static pre-trained intelligence from LLMs with continuous training to learn local contexts. AI progress is bottlenecked by backpropagation, which necessitates labelled data to set the ground truth while also leaving a gap between training and inference that result in increasingly larger, more homogenizing models.

We are hiring for applied researchers &amp; various engineering rolesâ€“ please reach out to ali@aolabs.ai
