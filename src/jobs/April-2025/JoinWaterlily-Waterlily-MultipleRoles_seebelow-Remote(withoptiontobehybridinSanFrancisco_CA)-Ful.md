Waterlily - Multiple Roles, see below - Remote (with option to be hybrid in San Francisco, CA) - Full-time - www.waterlily.com

Waterlily uses advanced AI to tackle one of the biggest, unsolved challenges in retirement planning: long-term care (LTC). We have already closed enterprise deals with multiple Fortune 100 insurance carriers and distributors, and raised an oversubscribed $7m Seed round from backers such as Insight Partners, Nationwide, Edward Jones, Brewer Lane Ventures, and Genworth. Our mission is to help families proactively plan for LTC needs and costs, and reduce America&#x27;s multi-trillion-dollar LTC crisis.

We have extremely high standards and expect our team to move quickly while maintaining top quality. Our interview process is rigorous, and most applicants will not pass. Those who do join a small, highly skilled team working directly with our founders (who started college at ages 11 and 14, attended UC Berkeley and MIT, and have built and sold successful startups backed by Founders Fund and Khosla Ventures before). We value rapid learning, candid feedback, and intense execution. We all invest more than 50 hours a week, sometimes up to 80, when needed to achieve top-tier outcomes. We want people who thrive in that environment, with the maturity to also pace themselves for sustainability.

Open Roles

Full-Stack Engineer

Node.js, TypeScript, React, Python. Architect new product features, improve performance, and pioneer how we use AI.

Generalist

A multi-department operator spanning sales, operations, and customer support. Automate processes using no-code and AI solutions, manage key initiatives, and grow rapidly in the insurance and healthcare domain.

Director of Enterprise Accounts

Own complex c-suite level relationships with Fortune 100 companies. Combine high-level strategic thinking with hands-on execution, leading account success and driving expansions.

We provide competitive salaries, meaningful equity, health insurance, 401(k) match, and other benefits for US employees. International hires join as contractors with a comparable setup. To apply, you must be motivated to operate at a demanding pace, meet high standards, and share our commitment to solving long-term care at scale.
