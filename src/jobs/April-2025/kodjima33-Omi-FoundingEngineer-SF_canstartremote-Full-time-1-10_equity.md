Omi - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omi.me" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omi.me</a> - Founding Engineer - SF, can start remote - Full-time - 1-10% equity - $120k+&#x2F;year

Omi is a wearable AI memory that helps you recall everything important and make decisions. Put it on, speak, transcribe, summarize, automatically. In 10 months, we hit 300k users, 100M+ views, shipped 3 hardware prototypes and raised $2m from Tim Draper.

I&#x27;m Nik (Thiel Fellow, sold 2 startups incl. one to Toptal after scaling to $4M GMV). Omi is fast-moving, and looking for a founding engineer to join me. Ideal background: built&#x2F;architected real products at scale (consumer or hardware).

Stack: Flutter (need to move to React Native) and C.

We move fast. You&#x27;ll shape the future of wearable computing.
