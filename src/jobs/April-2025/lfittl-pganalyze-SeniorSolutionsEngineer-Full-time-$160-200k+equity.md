pganalyze - Senior Solutions Engineer - REMOTE (US&#x2F;Canada) - Full-time - $160-200k + equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pganalyze.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pganalyze.com</a>

At pganalyze, we&#x27;re redefining how developers optimize one of the world&#x27;s most popular databases, PostgreSQL. Our software gives companies like Atlassian, Robinhood, and Notion the tools to solve their most complex Postgres performance challenges, ensuring their mission-critical applications run smoothly at scale.

For our Solutions Engineering role you will directly work with our VP of Sales, as well as our Founder &amp; CEO (me!) on strategic deals, and develop the playbook for integrating pganalyze in complex customer environments. You will also actively contribute to both our documentation and the product itself. Our team is cross-functional, and our goal is to improve the pganalyze product where we can, to allow repeated delivery of a great customer experience.

We are looking for candidates with a strong background in working on Linux VMs in the cloud or on-premise, and with Kubernetes or containers. Go experience is a big plus, since our agent (the pganalyze collector) is written in Go, and this role may involve making the collector work in different environments, and improving cloud provider API integrations.
