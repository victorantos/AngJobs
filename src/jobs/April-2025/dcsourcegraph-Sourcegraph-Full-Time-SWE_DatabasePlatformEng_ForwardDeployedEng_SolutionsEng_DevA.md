Sourcegraph is how enterprises industrialize software development with AI. We accelerate and automate how software is built in the world&#x27;s most important companies, including 7&#x2F;10 top software companies by market cap and 4&#x2F;6 top US banks.

Every successful codebase becomes large and complex. Instead of improving the product, devs spend more of their time just understanding the code and doing low-level tasks. The solution is to accelerate humans doing what they&#x27;re best at--and to automate the rest with AI agents, meaning more creativity and less toil for devs.

Sourcegraph is the industrial software development platform, accelerating human devs with contextual AI and automating toil away with AI agents, and it&#x27;s proven today in the world&#x27;s most important companies. Our tech stack combines frontier technologies in code search, static analysis, and LLM training and evaluation. Our founders code!
