prokube.ai - Platform Engineers - Northern Germany (Hamburg or Bremen) - Full-time - ONSITE (or hybrid) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prokube.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prokube.ai&#x2F;</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justadd.ai&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justadd.ai&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>

We are building an integrated MLOps platform based on Kubernetes, Kubeflow, GitLab and many more best-of-breed Open Source solutions, running anywhere our customers need it to (on-premises, in the cloud, or in a corporate data center, possibly air-gapped).
We are looking for engineers who are interested in LLMOps, MLOps and DevOps and have some interest in AI; ideally, you have some exposure to the k8s ecosystem already.
If you&#x27;re not well-versed in some areas but are eager to learn, we&#x27;d still love to hear from you. Motivation is much more important than experience to us.

Prokube.ai was founded in January out of Just Add AI. We have offices in Bremen and Hamburg.

We offer flexibility with location &amp; hours and, if you are interested, the opportunity to contribute to open source.
