Swizzl AI - Remote within SF or LA - Founding Engineer - Part-Time to Full-Time

We are building an AI buying concierge that sits on an ecomm or b2b site that helps customers buy confusing or complex items.  In turn, companies increase their qualified leads &amp; conversion rates and lower returns.  It&#x27;s ecommerce and lead generation reimagined in an AI world.  We are Jobs to be Done experts (see Laser.ventures) and we are employing our deep expertise in the field to productize what we already know works.  www.swizzl.ai

We are looking for a full stack engineer who leans back end.

This is going to be the craziest ride of your life.  We are swinging for the fences here trying to build a generational company.  We&#x27;re a group of seasoned brillant weirdos.  We work fast but smart and we have a lot of fun.

Email me with your resume and something (non-business) fun&#x2F;weird&#x2F;quirky about you:  andrew.glaser@laser.ventures

p.s. We want missionaries, not mercenaries so big equity is in, big cash is out.  Currently bootstrapped but we&#x27;ll have access to capital when the time comes.
