Mindmonopol - Senior Frontend Engineer (Angular) - Remote (EU) - Full-time or part-time - English (German helpful but not required)

Mindmonopol is building a product that will enable consultants to perform data analytics tasks similar to a no-code fashion, enabling reusability of components. Our aim is to focus on tasks such as data migrations, year-end closing and other things that usually take a lot of formal work to verify and automate the formality by reusing proven methods.

Our frontend is in dire need of a senior engineer. We are specifically looking for someone with enough experience and know-how to be able to architect a system. Up to now, we had no frontend specialist (except a freelancer working 1 day a week) and it turned into a mess. We want to build the frontend on a solid foundation and are looking for someone that is willing to take ownership and incentive, who isn&#x27;t shy to raise concerns. Ideally you would be willing to grow into a leadership position over time, but it isn&#x27;t strictly required, right now our focus is on looking for someone with a strong technical background.

The frontend is built on Angular&#x2F;AWS.
