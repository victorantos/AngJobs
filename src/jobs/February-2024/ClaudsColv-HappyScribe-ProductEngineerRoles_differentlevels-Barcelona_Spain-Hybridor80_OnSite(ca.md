Happy Scribe - Product Engineer Roles, different levels - Barcelona, Spain - Hybrid or 80% On Site (can sponsor VISA)

With a team of just 28 people and no investor funding, we’ve built a transcription and subtitling product used and loved by 5M people, we’ve built one of the biggest Speech To Text datasets and we’ve been profitable from month 1 (currently €6.5M ARR). We are 100% bootstrapped and profitable, and immune from the funding shortages and layoffs that are impacting other companies.

We&#x27;re hiring Product-focused Full Stack Engineers to help us scale our product, Data Analysts for the Product team.

In the next year we want to hire 10 engineers; if you don&#x27;t see anything that fits now, get in touch anyway. We want to learn about your career goals so we can reach out in the future.

This might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to solve one of the fundamental AI challenges of this decade.

We offer visa sponsorship and relocation packages.

Compensation info

We are open to considering people from 2+ to 20+ years, which means it&#x27;s a very wide bracket. We&#x27;d start from €50,000 but it could go up to €100,000+ for a very senior engineer. We also offer equity. See our careers page for the full list of benefits and perks.
