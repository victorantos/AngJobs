HRL Laboratories - Senior Software Engineer; Principal Compiler Engineer - Common Lisp - ONSITE - Los Angeles, California - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantum.hrl.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quantum.hrl.com&#x2F;</a>

HRL Laboratories is a private, scientific laboratory that has been in business since 1960. We are best known for having created the first working laser.

We are doing R&amp;D on quantum computing, from fabrication to algorithms, all in-house, using a tech called exchange-only silicon dot qubits. We are looking for both senior engineering and management to help build out our compiler stack for a quantum programming language. We recently presented it, along with our language-oriented development approach, at the biggest physics conference: APS March Meeting. [1]

The quantum computing group uses Common Lisp, Coalton, Python, C++, and JavaScript to build a state-of-the-art operating system for physicists researching silicon dot quantum computers. Compiler development is done primarily in Common Lisp.

Those who are excellent programmers experienced with

- functional programming, and&#x2F;or Lisp, and&#x2F;or statically typed ML-descendants;

- compilers, machine architecture;

- and solid undergraduate mathematics and advanced computer science

are most qualified. We can train you on Lisp, Coalton, and quantum if the fundamentals are there. Knowledge of quantum computing is *not* necessary for most software engineering roles.

Interview process: phone call, &quot;take-home&quot; exercise, on-site interview (no whiteboarding), reference checks, and offer.

Candidates must be eligible to obtain and maintain a U.S. security clearance, and must be willing to relocate to southern California.
