Modus is a continuous workforce compliance and planning platform that enables various employees throughout the organization to stay compliant with labor laws, visualize and execute workforce plans, and make data-driven decisions to ensure fairness and equity. You can think of us as Vanta for HR. Our mission is integrity. We&#x27;ve all been through the pains of levels, benchmarks, compensation inequities. Why can&#x27;t HR tech be intuitive, easy to use, and encompass workflows for everyone in the org?

While we are just at the beginning, both founders have an extensive experience in the industry. One of the co-founders was early Google engineer and built multiple companies in the past, writing significant amount of code at each company. Joining early means you have a significant say into tech and design choices.

We are looking for curious and motivated colleagues to turn our vision into a reality. All positions are 100% remote with no on-site requirements of any kind. We are currently looking for:

<pre><code>  - Javascript&#x2F;frontend developers
  - Designers
  - Backend developers
</code></pre>
Interview process: phone call, &quot;take-home&quot; exercise, interview with each founder separately, reference checks, and offer (can be done in less than a week)
