Microsoft (Power BI) - Mid Level or Senior Engineer - Full-time - Onsite (Redmond, WA)

We are the Power BI client engineering infrastructure team at Microsoft. Our team is responsible for building the infrastructure and tooling that powers the Power BI client applications. We are a small, fast-paced team that works on a wide variety of projects, from building the and maintaining the core infrastructure for our 300 person mono repo to investing in new technologies and frameworks to improve our development experience. We work on everything from TypeScript to Nx to Webpack to DevOps.

We are looking for a strong engineer who is passionate about building great developer experiences and who is excited to work on a product that is used by millions of people every day.
We are specifically looking for someone with experience in mono repo design and webpack tooling, someone that can roll up their sleeves and really dig into the details of our tooling to make it better.
