Graphistry - Viz engineer - Security engineer - Contract - REMOTE - GLOBAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com</a> + <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.louie.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.louie.ai</a>

Graphistry is a Gartner-awarded startup used by fraud&#x2F;cyber&#x2F;BI&#x2F;supplychain&#x2F;misinfo&#x2F;... analysts to see and correlate using our visual graph AI platform. Now piloting with enterprise &amp; gov teams around the world, louie.ai adds a genAI-first notebooks &amp; dashboards with the ability to talk directly with their many databases in natural language while having Louie help generate the queries, GPU visualizations, &amp; analyses for them.

Behind-the-scenes, we partner with companies like Nvidia &amp; AWS to enable end-to-end GPU computing so operational teams can do all this at previously impossible scales and interactivity. Some projects folks may know us for include having created the web tier of Apache Arrow, incubating what became Nvidia RAPIDS.AI, and our own server&lt;&gt;client GPU accelerated data visualization engine.

Graphistry is a small team experiencing record revenue &amp; growth driven by our innovating technology &amp; product, and not dependent on VCs.

We are looking for multiple new teammates:

- Visualization engineer - Scaling server&#x2F;client GPU infoviz

<pre><code>  We are looking for a visualization engineer excited about enabling analysts to dig into bigger and trickier data. The near-term projects are around initiatives like increasing our visual scale another 100X (client GLSL &lt;&gt; server RAPIDS.ai GPU) and improving how analysts understand and collaborate (React, node, RAPIDS GPU). You’ll be working with our full-stack team, partners like Nvidia, and as we are a user-focused team, you’ll also have the chance to chat directly with analysts in our community channels and engage with their data teams. Over time, you’ll take ownership of increasing parts of the full stack GPU visualization pipeline and its direction. Global remote friendly, long-term (1yr+), and option of contract vs full-time (equity etc).

- Security engineer - AI code sandbox hardening, SOC2&#x2F;ISO&#x2F;FedRAMP&#x2F;...

<pre><code>  We’re looking for a security engineer (any time zone) to design, implement, test, and harden the AI code sandbox  louie.ai uses to secure untrusted code execution . You will collaborate with our architects and developers as we prepare the surrounding application for third-party security auditing and pen testing. You should have some familiarity with Linux and container security practices and tools such as libseccomp policies, strace, iptables, and container networking. Ideally you have worked on sandbox and jail breaking technology before from a attacker&#x2F;defender side, and OS&#x2F;network&#x2F;container&#x2F;VM isolation mechanisms in general. You must be _very_ comfortable with Python + Docker. This is a 2-4w initial project with follow-on opportunities. Global&#x2F;remote fine, with key meetings on PDT (US) time zones

</code></pre>
- Security analytics field staff

<pre><code>  Full position TBA: We&#x27;re looking for someone to help enterprise&#x2F;gov&#x2F;tech teams spin up on Louie.AI and Graphistry. This includes innovative use case development around our technologies and applying them to impactful cybersecurity problems. US Clearance, broader background in intelligence tech, and being based in DC are all pluses.
