*THIS POSITION HAS BEEN FILLED AS OF 21 FEBRUARY 2024*

AirIn Technologies - Entry-level AWS Cloud Engineer - Remote (US time zones) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airintech.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airintech.com&#x2F;</a>

Our company works in the US-government space, primarily with the R&amp;D sector. We advocate on behalf of government, trying to ensure that research is done correctly and efficiently. Governmental organizations pursue research, and we help guide them.

Our government client runs effectively the Great British Bake-off for science projects. In this metaphor, the cakes are software: your job is to help build the kitchen, the plumbing, the ovens, etc.

This role is about being one of two AWS cloud engineers for an entire government organization â€” this is a great way to get a ton of experience and have the freedom to learn.

We&#x27;re looking for someone junior who&#x27;s keen to learn: you&#x27;ll be working with me to build, manage, and maintain 3 different AWS cloud environments.

You have:

- decent programming experience (shell&#x2F;python)

- decent sysadmin experience (linux)

- a desire to learn

I&#x27;m happy to teach you everything I know, since learning AWS wasn&#x27;t easy, and will give you time on the clock to work on programming projects to enhance your skills.

Reach out ari [at] airintech [period] com for more details.
