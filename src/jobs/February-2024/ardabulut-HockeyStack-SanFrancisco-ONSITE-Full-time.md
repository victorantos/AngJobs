HockeyStack - San Francisco - ONSITE - Full-time - $160-200k + equity, employee #12

---

HockeyStack is the core data platform for B2B revenue teams to get insights from their customer data instantly.

We grew from 0 to 7-figures last year, went through YC, and raised from some of the biggest VCs, such as General Catalyst and NEA. But we need more engineers to keep up with all the feature requests and expand the product into new avenues.

Our first engineer was the founding CTO at Chili Piper (took the company to series B). We are keeping the talent bar very high to build the smartest engineering team we can.

This is a full-on IC role where you&#x27;ll work with the founders directly in-person in SF, push new features every week and build one of the best B2B products out there.
