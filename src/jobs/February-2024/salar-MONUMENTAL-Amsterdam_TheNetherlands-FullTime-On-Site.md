MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - On-Site

We&#x27;re building autonomous on-site construction robots at Monumental, starting with bricklaying.

We have built a product and technology that works, deployed it in real-life construction sites with excited pilot customers, and raised funding from some of the best in the world. We&#x27;re still a small and nimble team of 15 and are hiring mechanical engineers and multiple software engineering roles (product, controls, and machine vision)
