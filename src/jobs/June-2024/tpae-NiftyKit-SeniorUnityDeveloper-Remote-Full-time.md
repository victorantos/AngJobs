NiftyKit - Senior Unity Developer - Remote - Full-time

We&#x27;re a web3 NFT platform looking to hire a senior unity developer to work on exciting projects related to NFTs and gaming. Our team is based in Los Angeles, but we&#x27;re a remote-first company.

We like to build and launch quickly and iterate fast as we collect feedback. If this resonates with you, we want to work with you.

Web3 experience is unnecessary, but be open-minded about what is currently possible. Bonus points if you love cars and have built racing games before.

Please send us your resume and project links, and tell us about your first car.
