HN TL:DR;

We’re looking for a principal engineer with Ruby&#x2F;Rails experience to lead the technical implementation of our Canvas-based product for justice-impacted (especially incarcerated) individuals.  This role will be focused on technical leadership, but (particularly early on while we are still building the team) will involve hands-on code contributions.  Ameelio is a great place to work because the people are great, and the mission is one everybody can get behind.  We’re a non-profit (with a good amount of runway) and a very bright future.  Come be a part of that future!
