ReconWell - (Senior&#x2F;Staff) Full Stack Software Engineer - REMOTE in Germany&#x2F;Switzerland - 70-100k€

At ReconWell, we’re a dynamic, small company dedicated to app development for psychiatric hospitals. Partnering with a prestigious university psychiatry in Switzerland, our work is at the forefront of mental health research and application.

We value tight integration of domain experts into our engineering. Using our specialised platform we deliver software faster and better than many others in this space. Quality management and regulatory requirements are central to our business.

Tech Stack: Kotlin, TypeScript, JetBrains MPS (Language Engineering, DSL), Spring Boot, React Native

Looking for a self-driven, curious person to join our engineering team. Should bring at least a few years of relevant experience.

You would be expected to start from an area where you&#x27;re most comfortable in (Frontend, Backend, Ops, QA, DSL, ...) and grow from there. Eventually you should be able to work on all parts of our codebase without mentoring.

I&#x27;m Philip, CTO of ReconWell and my email is philip@reconwell.de
