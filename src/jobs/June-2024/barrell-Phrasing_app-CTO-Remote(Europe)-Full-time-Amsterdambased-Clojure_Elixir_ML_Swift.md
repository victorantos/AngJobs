Phrasing.app - CTO - Remote (Europe) - Full-time - Amsterdam based - Clojure, Elixir, ML, Swift

We&#x27;re a small scrappy team of two building a language learning app to rival the giants. We&#x27;ve just launched privately, and are getting ready for a larger public launch (once the major bugs are fixed and the ftux is documented).

Now that we&#x27;re starting to get paying users, we&#x27;re looking for another engineer to join the team. This would be a full-time, full-remote, and semi-synchronous position (semi-synchronous meaning expect to co-work, pair, or chat on video for a few hours per day).

Our tech stack includes: ClojureScript + ShadowCLJS, Python + FastAPI, Elixir + Phoenix, Supabase + ElectricSQL, Swift.

We spent a good amount of time documenting the ideal candidate, application instructions included: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app&#x2F;dream-team" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app&#x2F;dream-team</a>

PS: We just launched our new site yesterday, and moved all our servers. Everything should be working, but apologies if some links are dead for the next couple of days while we hunt them all down :)
