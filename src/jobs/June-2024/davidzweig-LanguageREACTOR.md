Language REACTOR

Me and Ognjen are based in BULGARIA &#x2F; Serbia. Most of the time REMOTE, but, generally we like to meet up 2-3 times a year for a few weeks in a nice location.

We make software for learning languages. The focus is on making tools, rather than content. It&#x27;s a competitive field. That means understanding learners&#x27; needs, and relentlessly applying ingenuity and resourcefulness to make something of value. We manage well though, and the financial side is solid.

We run bare metal servers at Hetzner, and a number of big GPU machines in Bulgaria.

Salaries are ~Western European. Additionally, special effort will not be unrewarded. I can help arrange an EU Blue Card &#x2F; VISA if needed. Bulgaria is Schengen now, taxes among the lowest in the EU, lots of mountains and pine trees, cost of living still relatively low. No hard rules around work hours or vacation. If you are reliably helping the project progress, and are available during critical weeks, I don&#x27;t mind what time you drink your coffee or what timezone you are in.

As a minimum:

-- Thoroughly comfortable writing Typescript (or experience with similar language)

-- Familiarity with HTML&#x2F;CSS

-- ..and linux terminal.

There&#x27;s a substantial amount of mostly decent code, some even pretty good. It will take some time to become familiar. Noone will be standing over your shoulder, you need to be able to make yourself useful. You will be creating new features. Somewhat open-ended, rather than just taking bug tickets. Things need to be polished and hardened before launch, and some older code needs rewriting from time to time.

Other skills that would be highly useful:

-- Backend skills (linux admin, ZFS backups, postgres tuning etc.)

-- Knowledge around ML&#x2F;DL, Python, NLP, fine-tuning LLMs, ASR and TTS.

-- Strong React and CSS skills (we use MUI for our website, and have an unfinished RN Tamagui prototype).

-- Doing some server hardware maintenance or upgrades (server hardware is mostly like PC hardware with some extra bits).

-- Not adverse to occasional travel to meet a potential collaborator, or some occasional non-code work.

-- Experience or connections in highschool&#x2F;university language education.

-- Knowledge of languages, particularly East Asian.

-- Electronics design and manufacture (yes).

I&#x27;m not adverse to teaching what I know, but then it&#x27;s probably going to need to be more in-person then.

I&#x27;ll be honest here: this could be a dream job for some, and rather demanding for others.
