contextflow ADVANCE Chest CT provides radiologists comprehensive computer-aided detection support for suspected lung cancer, ILD and COPD cases. It&#x27;s main features are designed to help save time and improve reporting quality: nodule detection and quantification, nodule tracking over time, quantitative lung tissue analysis for key image findings, and qualitative analysis of 19 image patterns plus reference cases and differential diagnosis information.

We are a small product department with developers, R&amp;D and DevOps folks creating a real product that is running on-premise at many hospitals creating real impact. contextflow is a great place for getting into all things medical software development.

I personally joined fully-remote in January 2023 as a DevOps Engineer. I really enjoy what we are creating and I am excited to be in a relatively young company to grow with something that is meaningful to me. An environment where everyone is interested on medical aspects has been a refreshing experience.

We look forward to receiving your application!
