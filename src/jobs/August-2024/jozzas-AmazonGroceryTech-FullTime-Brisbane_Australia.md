Amazon Grocery Tech - Full Time - ONSITE Hybrid (in-offce 3 days p&#x2F;w) - Brisbane, Australia

I&#x27;m a developer in grocery working in Brisbane. We&#x27;re currently hiring for grads &#x2F; recent grads (&lt;24 months exp, with some flexibility there). We mostly write software for outbound grocery (delivery + pickup) worldwide, for both Amazon and 3P brands. We have fun and exciting challenges to suit all interests. Feel free to email me if you want to learn more.

The office in Brisbane is a beautiful place to work (there are flexible working options blending at home and in office), and I can personally vouch for the teams in Brisbane being awesome to work for, with interesting and fulfilling work.

From our job ad:
&gt; ... The features you build have direct impact on customers lives. You will work with scientists and engineers to optimize fulfillment processes, reducing costs and improving quality. You will experiment with new ideas, turning the successful ones into full production systems whilst failing fast and learning from those which are not. We obsess over reducing the time and cost in fulfilling a customer&#x27;s order.
