Interviewer - New York, NY - Full-time - Founding Engineers - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getinterviewer.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getinterviewer.com</a>

Interviewer automates first-round screening interviews with an AI voice agent. We&#x27;re well-funded, deployed with multiple customers and are already hitting non-trivial scaling challenges.

We&#x27;re looking for founding engineers who have strong intuitions on implementing strong reliability, low-latency systems as well as realtime observability systems to go along with it. ML experience is a plus but the focus is on full-stack software engineering right now.

We pay above market, have all the healthcare benefits you could want and are in-person at our office in lower Manhattan.

Send an email to shreyas@techinterviewer.ai (me, the CTO) if you&#x27;re interested!
