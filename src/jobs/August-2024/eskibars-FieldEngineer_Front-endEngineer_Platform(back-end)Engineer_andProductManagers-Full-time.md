Vectara (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectara.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectara.com</a>) - Field Engineer, Front-end Engineer, Platform  (back-end) Engineer, and Product Managers - Full-time - Egypt, Pakistan, and&#x2F;or Remote (depends on position)

Vectara is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a service platform.  We have a ton of IP already: an embedding model that outperforms Cohere and OpenAI, a reranking model that does similarly, a generative model that outperforms GPT 4 for RAG, a prompt engine that can provide citations and markdown&#x2F;HTML links in RAG use cases, a leading hallucination detection model, well as our own internal high-performance vector&#x2F;hybrid database.  We just raised $25 million in series A and we&#x27;re hiring a number of roles.

I personally lead product and before Vectara led product management teams at Kong and Elasticsearch at Elastic and am looking for a technically minded product manager with a few years experience in B2B.  Location is pretty flexible for the role, but I&#x27;d prefer someone in the US to help increase our timezone coverage for US-based deals and working with our many US (mostly west coast) colleagues.  I&#x27;m based in Berlin now after having been in SF for the past ~15 years.

All positions are at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectara.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#job-listings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectara.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#job-listings</a>, but if you&#x27;re a PM and interested in developer-focused GenAI, you can reach me at shane at [our domain, above]
