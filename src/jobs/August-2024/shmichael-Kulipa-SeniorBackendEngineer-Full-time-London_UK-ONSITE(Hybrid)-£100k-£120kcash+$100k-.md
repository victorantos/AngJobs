Kulipa - Senior Backend Engineer - Full-time - London, UK - ONSITE (Hybrid) - £100k-£120k cash + $100k-$120k equity (~0.5%-0.6%)

Hi, I&#x27;m Michael. CTO and co-founder of Kulipa. Previously I was an engineer and engineering manager at Google and Meta&#x2F;WhatsApp.

Kulipa issues debit cards (Visa&#x2F;MC) backed by crypto wallets instead of bank accounts.

We enable users in emerging markets to hold USD and EUR (via stablecoins) in self-custodial wallets, while seamlessly spending it in their local market. This is unlike any other &quot;crypto&quot; card today.
