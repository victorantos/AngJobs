MyAlloy - Remote (NYC based) - Full-time (US) or Contract (international, +-3 CST)

MyAlloy is on a mission to revolutionize menopause healthcare for women over 40. Recognizing the lack of effective solutions for the 47 million women entering menopause annually, MyAlloy provides evidence-based solutions and expertise to help women feel fantastic during this phase of life.

Our small in-house development team builds and maintains a marketing site, customer portal, internal apps, backend systems to connect to our doctor portal, payment systems, and pharmacy fulfillment. You&#x27;ll receive quite a lot of ownership, but we&#x27;ll support you every step of the way.

* Mid-level Front-end Developer (2-3 years experience) 120k-140k

We run A&#x2F;B tests using PostHog (ycombinator alum!) to scientifically update our marketing site and intake - optimizing for time through the flow, effectiveness, revenue, and operational efficiencies. You&#x27;ll work with our CRO expert to create tests to optimize our funnel. We&#x27;re looking for an organized data geek who can sling typescript! Once through our A&#x2F;B test backlog you&#x27;ll participate in full stack dev alongside the team.

* Junior Software Engineer in Test (New grads OK) 80k-110k

Working with our head of QA, run and maintain our suite of Playwright tests. You&#x27;ll work with the team to understand the requirements for new projects, then update the Playwright tests to accommodate that functionality. You&#x27;ll push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible in automation - using Mailsaur, Github actions, and more. This role is great for a new dev to hone their skills and grow into full stack dev.

Tech: Typescript monorepo, React, Next.js, Node, Postgres
