Automattic - Remote - Full-time - Multiple roles - $110-$210k+ and great benefits

We&#x27;re looking for engineers to help us build, grow, and maintain products used by over a billion people each month across WordPress.com, WooCommerce, WordPress VIP, Jetpack, Tumblr, Beeper &amp; Texts.com, Day One, Pocket Casts, and many more.

If you love the open web, open source, radical problem ownership, and simple over pure solutions, Automattic is probably the place for you.

We have a distributed, remote, async work environment - and we&#x27;ve had it since we started.
