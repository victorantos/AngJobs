doxel.ai - REMOTE (US)- Full-Time - Product and Data Focused Software Engineers

Iâ€™m Will, the Head of Engineering for Doxel, an a16z backed computer vision company bringing observability and insights into the physical world of construction.

Construction is a $12T industry worldwide, yet over 90% of construction projects are delivered late! That&#x27;s because decision makers still have to rely on subjective, manual and inconsistent reporting from humans - which leads to problems being discovered too late, rather than at runtime - which is when they can be prevented from snowballing.

2023 was an amazing year of growth for Doxel. And we&#x27;re just getting started.
