Veridise - Lead Frontend Software Engineer - Remote (Any timezone) - Full-Time

Veridise is a security startup that performs security reviews of source code with the assistance of fuzzing, static analysis, and formal verification tools that we&#x27;ve built in-house. Our customers mostly come from the zero-knowledge proof and blockchain communities.

We&#x27;re looking for a motivated lead frontend software engineer to help lead the development of the frontend of a B2B SaaS platform aimed at improving the security review process. This includes working on features like code review tools and interactive visualizations.

We use TypeScript, React, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, with some frontend code transitioning away from ClojureScript.
