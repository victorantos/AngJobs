Freeform (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeform.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeform.co&#x2F;</a>) - Software Engineers - Full-time - Onsite - Los Angeles, CA

We recently secured a key partnership with NVIDIA’s Inception Program where we&#x27;re pioneering the use of GPUs and custom AI algorithms to automate our metal 3D printing factories. We&#x27;re working on a lot of cool projects including factory automation, big data pipelines, physics-based ML&#x2F;AI, and advanced hardware control (think high power lasers meet robotic systems!) 
It’s a small, tight-knit team and you’d have the opportunity to own significant and impactful greenfield projects throughout the entire development lifecycle and much more.

Our software team comes from the likes of Google, SpaceX, and Apple, and believe in taking a first principles approach to solving hard problems.
