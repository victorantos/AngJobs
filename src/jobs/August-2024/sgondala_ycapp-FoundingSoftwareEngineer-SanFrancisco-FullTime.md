FurtherAI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;furtherai.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;furtherai.com&#x2F;</a>) - Founding Software Engineer - San Francisco - Full Time

At FurtherAI, we are building a workforce of AI Teammates to automate insurance workflows involving processing unstructured documents, data entry into internal systems or web portals, or even making phone calls.

Our core mission is to answer a critical question: Can AI be made as reliable, adaptive, and continuously learning as a new human employee?

Our founding team features a second time founder and a language modeling scientist from Apple. We have raised a pre-seed round from top-tier investors, including Y Combinator, South Park Commons, and Converge VC.

We&#x27;re looking for exceptional software and backend engineers to join our founding team. You&#x27;ll play a pivotal role in building the core product while also spearheading efforts to ensure scalability, optimize performance, and continuously improve the product to meet evolving needs and challenges.

If you&#x27;re excited about working at the intersection of AI agents and workflows, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.
