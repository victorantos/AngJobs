* Apply Here *: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;e4aPgyX6QYiKDhc9A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;e4aPgyX6QYiKDhc9A</a>

Raylu is AI for financial services. Our product combines domain-trained and specialized financial LLM systems with a workflow, prompt, and knowledge base builder - giving funds accurate and cutting-edge AI that is deeply bespoke to their needs

Raylu’s engineering team of 5 people is looking to expand and hire an *AI Engineer*. We are looking for an engineer who is comfortable working with complex LLM systems, excel’s at experiment and evaluation driven development, and has a passion for solving hard open ended problems.

* Requirements *
- Experience with LLM systems. You are an expert in sophisticated RAG, chains and agentic systems (Langchain based), and fine-tuning.
- Experience working in a production python back-end. We build and manage our own systems and services, and therefore value scalability and reliability - we need an AI engineer who is a capable back-end engineer
- You have a ruthless work ethic and refuse to give up on excellence. A lot of this job is solving open-ended problems that require many failed experiments before a solution solves the problem - and we need engineers thick-skinned enough for that process.
- We often hit problems that genuinely require reading research papers in order to design new experiments to run. A formal background in ML is preferable, but are open minded to an AI engineer with a SWE background.
- You will be working with Raylu’s head of AI directly on a day-to-day basis.

*Company Culture and Values*:

- We are a small team of 6 all based out of NYC working out of our office in midtown Manhattan everyday (with WFH flexibility when needed).
- Everyday we tackle new unsolved challenges
- We work hard. We don’t believe in hustle culture, toxic workplaces, and sacrificing health.    , but startups are really hard - so we put in the time and effort needed to succeed.
- We are courageous yet humble with our work. Everyday we sprint into unknown territory courageously building what we think is *the* thing everyone wants, but we have the humility to hear feedback, fail gracefully, and rebuild quickly.

*Logistics*:

- Compensation: $110K - $165K, 0.15%-0.3% equity
- Location: Mid-town Manhattan We are a fully in-office team working out of Midtown Manhattan Monday through Friday. We allow for WFH days when anyone is traveling, but we do not allow for permanent remote work.
- Benefits: Generous health, dental, and vision insurance, 401k with 3% automatic contribution (no vesting), Paid Lunches, Wellness and Citi Bike benefit
