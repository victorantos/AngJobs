Hi, I&#x27;m William, the co-founder and CEO of Maestro AI.  Throughout my career in software engineering, I&#x27;ve repeatedly witnessed how fragmented workflows and broken processes can stifle even the most brilliant teams. That&#x27;s why I started Maestro AI. Our mission is to streamline the process of software development, turning chaos into clarity so that teams can accomplish more.

Maestro AI provides real-time, comprehensive insights for teams so everyone can easily see what&#x27;s happening, how projects are progressing, and where people are blocked.  We eliminate information silos by aggregating data from multiple collaborative tools like Slack, Jira, Notion, and Github, enabling seamless communication and informed decision-making across the entire organization.

Here&#x27;s a recent demo video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Xd7_0fURLxU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Xd7_0fURLxU</a>

We&#x27;re an early-stage, venture-backed startup, and you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to shape our product and culture from the ground up.

We&#x27;re looking for someone who takes pride in their craft, pushes their limits, and takes action to create something new.  Our stack is Python on the backend and React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Typescript on the frontend.  We&#x27;re training our own models in addition to using existing LLMs.
