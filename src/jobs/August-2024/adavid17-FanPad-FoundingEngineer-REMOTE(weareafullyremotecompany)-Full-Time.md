FanPad - Founding Engineer - REMOTE (we are a fully remote company) - Full-Time

We&#x27;re building a web platform to help musicians find out who their top fans are, and then engage with them, reward them, and monetize them. We just raised our first round of funding - and are focused on adding new product features, and scaling to handle larger artists.

We&#x27;re looking for a founding engineer to work alongside me (technical - spends most of my time writing code) and the founder (non-technical). The ideal candidate would be a self-sufficient full-stack engineer with 5+ years of experience, an interest in music, and some experience working with AWS or a different cloud platform - but don&#x27;t let not exactly matching this description keep you from reaching out!

Our tech stack: Angular, .NET, Postgres, AWS

We offer competitive salary + equity. If you&#x27;re interested, please reach out to me at: alex at fanpad dot xyz
