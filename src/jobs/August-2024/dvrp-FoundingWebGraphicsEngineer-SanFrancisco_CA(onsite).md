KREA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krea.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krea.ai</a>) - Founding Web Graphics Engineer - San Francisco, CA (onsite)

Hi, I&#x27;m Diego Rodriguez, Cofounder&#x2F;CTO of KREA.

We are building tools to use AI creatively on the web (e.g. images, but also videos). Our team is 7 incl. founders. All of us are technical. We&#x27;ve been backed by world-class investors such as the cofounder of Facebook AI Research, Keith Adams; or, a founding member of OpenAI, Pamela Vagata. Happy to disclose more details over a call.

Requirements: we do not care too much about technology stacks 
in general and we don&#x27;t think you should care (too much) about it either. In fact, a lot of what we&#x27;ve done is vanilla JavaScript &#x2F; Svelte. Yet, experience with shaders, design, taste, and AI research &amp;&amp; -- engineering is heavily appreciated. Ideally, you would own all the UI&#x2F;Graphics Engineering of the main product.
