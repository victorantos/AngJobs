Topaz Labs builds the world&#x27;s best AI image and video upscalers.

We just hit 39 employees, and $45million in revenue. Self funded, profitable.

Despite hitting $45m in revenue, we&#x27;ve never had a sales team. Our CEO and product managers are running sales, we need a Founding Sales Executive to help us build this function.
