Hi, I&#x27;m Vasek [0]. CEO of E2B. We&#x27;re building an open-source [1] cloud runtime for AI agents.

Users have started over 1.4M of our sandboxes for AI agents and we&#x27;ve been growing 30%-60% MoM. We&#x27;re a team of 4, have a revenue from seed to enterprise companies and just closed a new round of funding.

Things you&#x27;ll work on:

- JS &amp; Python SDKs

- CLI (TypeScript)

- Making sure our Firecracker sandboxes start in &lt;100ms (Golang + Rust)
