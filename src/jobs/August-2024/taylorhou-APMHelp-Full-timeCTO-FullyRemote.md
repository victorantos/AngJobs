APM Help - Full-time CTO - Fully Remote - www.apmhelp.com
America&#x27;s largest residential rental operations platform

We currently help manage 300k+ SFR in 49 States with all things back office but primarily property accounting and compliance.

We&#x27;re effectively bootstrapped, $6M+ ARR, cash flow positive, growing 20%+ y-o-y

We have a crack team of engineers led by a fantastic architect&#x2F;eng manager but I&#x27;m still looking for the technical co-founder mentality to solve problems with weekend sprints&#x2F;mvp&#x27;s (build 0-1) and then hand off to a team to stabilize and scale.

Comp will be competitive with equity (if valued) - we usually give 3 options. cash no options, cash + options, little cash more options.
