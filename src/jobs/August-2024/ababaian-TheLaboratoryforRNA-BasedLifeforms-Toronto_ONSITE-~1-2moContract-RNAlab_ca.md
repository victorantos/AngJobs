The Laboratory for RNA-Based Lifeforms - UI&#x2F;UX Science Developer - Toronto, ONSITE - ~1-2mo Contract - RNAlab.ca

We&#x27;re an academic research lab focused on Exploring Earth&#x27;s Virome, and identifying which viruses could be human disease-causing agents. We are building, Open Virome, an open-source platform to provide scientists with the ability to derive actionable insights from a massive DNA&#x2F;RNA sequencing database, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The SRA houses billions of dollars of data from over 27 million datasets (~100 petabytes raw data) collected over 16 years. By querying, aggregating and displaying relationships between sequencing datasets (and meta-data) and the viruses they contain, we hope to illuminate the hidden universe of viruses all around us.

We&#x27;re seeking a talented and innovative designer to assist the team with designing a user-friendly, intuitive, and visually compelling web interface for this research project and help further biomedical discovery. Looking for the right balance of design, data-scientist, and data visualization. Expertise in network analysis &#x2F; virology is an asset. Send an email, introduce yourself, and please include your portfolio (examples of your previous work).
