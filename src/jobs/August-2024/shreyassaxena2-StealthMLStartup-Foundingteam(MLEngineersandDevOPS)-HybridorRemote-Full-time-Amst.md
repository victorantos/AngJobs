Stealth ML Startup - Founding team (ML Engineers and DevOPS)- Hybrid or Remote- Full-time- Amsterdam, Netherlands

We are building a lean generative AI stack, which would be tailored end-to-end (eg. embeddings, vector database, GPT model, etc.) for different enterprise use cases. The entire stack has dozens of hyper-parameters, which when configured automatically via ML, unlock &gt; 10x advantage over existing solutions. This is in contrast to existing status quo, where different companies (Cohere, OpenAI, Qdrant, etc.) are providing bloated foundational models&#x2F;generic stacks for different parts of the stack.

Doing things end-to-end has always shown to be a much better approach (eg. Apple running efficient ML models on device), we would like to be the first to do it in the Generative AI space.

We are currently in the final stages of setting up the company and are figuring out the exact head-count and key people in the founding team. If you are passionate about: working on an interesting product, competing with folks from the valley (but from Europe), do reach out. We are looking for folks from ML research, ML engineering &amp; DevOps background. You can reach out on the email mentioned in the profile.

Why join us? deep desire to work on cutting-edge Generative AI tech, make significant impact as founding team, competitive compensation.
