Dirac - Software Engineer (£80k) + 0.5% equity - London, Acton - In-person

Run rate: £3.8m (july &#x27;24) up from £1.05m *jul &#x27;23)
Backed by patio11 &amp; backedvc, we&#x27;re an exporting startup, offering a chance to write code (django&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;python), learn to drive a forklift (Hyster J2.0UTT) and wire up label printers (brother-ql 1100c + a new zebra one which I bricked using Chat GPT sending commands directly through).

Experience as a forklift driver or as a software engineer not essential.

The role would ideally start in October, but we can be flexible (forecasting labour demand on an exponential curve is non-trivial)

Email me ethan@dirac.software if interested.
