MorphicML (working name for stealth-mode fully remote startup)

We&#x27;re working on highly reconfigurable RISC-V based processors aimed at ML&#x2F;AI applications with particular emphasis on supporting BitNet architectures - 1 and 2 bit ALU extensions. Initial implementation in FPGA.

Looking for people with a diverse set of backgrounds in EDA software development, compiler (LLVM&#x2F;MLIR), FPGA development.
