Tangram - Rust&#x2F;Linux Programmer - Remote (USA) - Full Time

At Tangram, we are making a programmable build system and package manager.

Check out the code samples here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tangram.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tangram.dev</a>.

We are looking to work with programmers who have experience with systems programming, Linux, and Rust. As a founding engineer on a small team, you will have the opportunity to work on interesting technical problems, such as:

* Building a content-addressed distributed file system.

* Making builds serverless with Nomad, V8, and Firecracker.

We are well funded by investors including Kleiner Perkins and the founders of GitHub, Vercel, and Slack.

If you are interested in joining us on our mission to save programmers from suffering with slow, unreliable builds, please reach out at jobs@tangram.dev.
