Over one third of apparel produced is never sold: Topologic’s mission is to eliminate this disastrous overproduction and waste by producing exactly to demand.

To do this, we’re reinventing apparel manufacturing, from CAD&#x2F;CAM software to novel intelligent machines. We are rethinking a massive $2T industry, are already generating substantial B2B revenue, and are backed with $10m from leading VCs and CAD insiders. We remain in relative stealth.

We are hiring passionate software engineers, especially with interest and experience in design tools, computer graphics, and CAD, as well as web development. We use TypeScript, React, Redux, WebGL 2, and lots of Rust! We are also hiring mechanical engineers to work on our novel hardware projects.

We have deep domain knowledge about our industry and partners and work with representative stakeholders in-house every day. We prioritize diversity and inclusion of all varieties. We appreciate our colleagues as unique individuals who all bring valuable perspectives to our work.
