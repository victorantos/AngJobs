Harvard Library Innovation Lab - Software Engineering Manager - Remote (some US states) or hybrid - Full-Time

The Harvard Library Innovation Lab is a software product studio and research lab embedded in the Harvard Law School Library, with a mission of bringing library principles to tech. We build software platforms like Perma.cc and the Caselaw Access Project; publish open source tools for access to knowledge; and host research fellows like Molly White of Web3 Is Going Just Great.

We are seeking a Software Engineering Manager to lead a team of six engineers across a range of projects. This position offers a mix of hands on work and leadership, in a relaxed environment, with high ability to set product goals in the public interest.

Harvard eligibility is weird: we can hire hybrid near Cambridge, MA, or remote only if you live in the states of CA, CT, GA, IL, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT and WA.
