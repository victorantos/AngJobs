Phrasing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app</a>) - CTO - Europe (REMOTE)

We&#x27;re looking to assemble a small but mighty team to topple giants. Together, we&#x27;ll leverage AI, ML, and LLMs to build the world&#x27;s most effective language learning solution. Our tech stack includes:

- ClojureScript + Reagent frontend with an in house local-first sync engine

- Elixir + Phoenix backend with a websocket API

- Elixir + Nx + Axon + Bumblebee for ML exploration

- Python + Hatchet for some background tasks

* Sidenote: We&#x27;re still working on rolling out the production version, but we&#x27;re on track to finish this month. You can expect a lot more information to appear on our blog starting this weekend, with a more public launch near the end of the month.
