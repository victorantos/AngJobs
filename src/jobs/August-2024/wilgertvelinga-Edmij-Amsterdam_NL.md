Edmij - Senior data engineer &amp; Senior Back-End Developer - Fulttime, Onsite &gt;= 2 days a week - Amsterdam, NL

Edmij is a Climate Tech scale-up focused on electrifying the Dutch energy market. Using classic and machine learning methods to forecast weather patterns, electricity usage, and energy market dynamics, we are able to efficiently allocate energy production and consumption for our clients.

Our steering algorithms for solar panels, turbines, and batteries maximize green-energy production and consumption in the Netherlands, alleviating the pressure on an overloaded energy-grid. This allows more renewable energy capacity to be installed, as well as improving access of users to less carbon-intensive energy sources. We are very profitable so no need for outside investors, allowing us to take a long-term view.

In the last years we have grown into a major player with some of the most advanced software and algorithms in this niche market. The next phase requires a level of professionalization and scalability in our operations to allow for explosive growth. We are seeking an experienced data engineer that would like to build&#x2F;improve our data platform, and a back-end developer to help create algorithms.

Weâ€™re a tightknit team of 20 mathematicians&#x2F;econometricians&#x2F;phycisists&#x2F;metereologists&#x2F;software developers.
