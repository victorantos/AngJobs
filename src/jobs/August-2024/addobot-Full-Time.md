Source is the developer data management infrastructure for the open web. With an expected 75% of the data generated by humanity to be at the edge, developers at organizations of all sizes face complex challenges in managing distributed data across various use cases. Our database, DefraDB, along with our trust protocol, provides developers with the tools to create and deploy software for edge&#x2F;local environments. With native cryptographic primitives for data security, granular data governance, and interoperability and portability across the edge. We address the crucial aspects of edge data management, empowering developers to introduce the next wave of local-first software, edge AI, smart city, industry 4.0, and beyond.
