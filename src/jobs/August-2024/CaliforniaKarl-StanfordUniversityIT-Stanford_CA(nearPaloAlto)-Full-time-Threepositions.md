Stanford University IT - Stanford, CA (near Palo Alto) - Full-time - Three positions - 2 HYBRID &amp; 1 REMOTE

Stanford University IT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uit.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uit.stanford.edu</a>) provides a large number of IT-related services to campus.  From typically enterprise-y stuff (financials software, HR software, AD, O365, Google, Zoom, etc.), to networking (building&#x2F;core switches, firewall, campus wifi, residential networking, circuits, VPN, DNS, IP mgmt.), to endpoints (desktop support, lab endpoint support, Jamf, mobile phones), to research (computing, storage, hosting, consulting), we provide a broad range of services to campus.

I have three positions to shout out here:

• The Information Security Office both acts as a policy-making body and a service provider.  ISO are looking for a Cloud Security Engineer.  This HYBRID or REMOTE position will engage with cloud users (including Faculty and Students with their own cloud presence), helping to keep their cloud installations secure.  You&#x27;ll handle security reviews, vulnerability reports, and incident response.  You&#x27;ll use tools like Wiz, Splunk, Qualys, CrowdStrike, and ProofPoint, plus a lot more.  For more information, check out <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDF81RNh" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDF81RNh</a>

• Stanford University Networking is hiring a LAN Engineer.  Responsible for 178k network ports and 17k Wi-Fi access points, LAN-E handles new physical network designs (for new builds and renovations), and acts as 2nd-level support for questions coming from the Local Network Administrators that support their end-users.  LAN-E deals with Cisco &amp; Juniper (both for Wired and Wireless), Palo Alto firewalls, VXLAN&#x2F;EVPN, and WDM.  For more information, check out <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD8JBRNg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD8JBRNg</a>

• Stanford University Networking is also hiring a CT Senior Network Engineer.  Communication Technology is the group responsible for voice comms across both the University and the Hospitals.  We are primarily a Cisco Unified Communications shop, but we deal also with Avaya.  Besides VoIP and analog service, you&#x27;ll work with Contact Center, call recording, E-911, and underlying technologies (SIP, BGP, etc.).

The two Networking positions are HYBRID positions. If you don&#x27;t already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you&#x27;re on-site (except in Menlo Park).

The ISO position can be HYBRID or REMOTE.  If Remote, expect to travel to either campus or our Redwood City offices a few times a year.

All three positions require participation in a 24x7 on-call rotation. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation). All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards</a>.
