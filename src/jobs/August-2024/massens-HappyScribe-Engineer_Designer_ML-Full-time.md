Happy Scribe - Engineer, Designer, ML - Onsite &amp; Hybrid (Barcelona, Spain) - Full-time

Hi there, Happy Scribe founder here. At Happy Scribe we think audio &amp; video should be universally accessible. Today’s state of the art is agencies doing everything manually. We want to scale high-quality subtitles &amp; dubbing with a multi-player editing experience that combines sota ai with a global marketplace of proofreaders. Being product-led we have the datasets needed to get there. It’s the Tesla autopilot play in the language service industry. When we succeed, we’ll live in a world where everyone can consume any content in their native language without degrading the experience.

A team of 5 engineers and 0$ VC money built a product used by +350k&#x2F;mo people with high 7-digit revenue. We inhabit a beautiful 4-story designer office in the Gràcia neighbourhood of Barcelona.

We sponsor visas and support relocation! Apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3LM4XKf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3LM4XKf</a>

We hire only builders and kind people :)

Cheers!
