Graphistry, Louie. AI - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphistry.com</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.louie.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.louie.ai</a> - US + Washington DC - Full time - Remote + Hybrid

Graphistry pioneered GPU cloud &lt;&gt; GPU client computing for visual graph AI, helping start what became Apache Arrow and Nvidia RAPIDS (GPU dataframes), and our new OSS GPU graph query language GFQL. Customers include banks, gov agencies, newspapers, and tech companies. It&#x27;s used in investigative &amp; commercial analytics domains, and is profitably growing. We spun out of US Berkeley, and our remote-first team is global, with an emphasis on US time zones. Almost all are in product engineering or AI solutions.

Louie.AI is genAI-native analytics that builds on the Graphistry mission and capabilities. The analyst-facing is genAI-native notebooks, dashboards, and APIs for working with data much more easily. On the backend, we&#x27;re building AI-automated investigation support. Ex: Real-time self-adjusting automated knowledge bases reacting to news&#x2F;threatfeeds&#x2F;logs&#x2F;etc that get directly consumed by analysts, and just as important, customer AI applications that can react to data changing such as in news and logs. Ex: Learning analyst workflows for autonomous always-on investigation.
