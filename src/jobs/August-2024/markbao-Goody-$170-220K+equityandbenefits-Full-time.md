Goody - Remote within North&#x2F;South America - $170-220K + equity and benefits - Full-time

Goody is hiring a Senior Software Engineer (Ruby, Rails, React) who moves at a startup pace, likes to ship fast, and is motivated by building delightful products.

I&#x27;m Mark, the technical co-founder and CTO at Goody. Despite being something everyone does, gifting is one of the areas of commerce yet to be disrupted. Our goal is to make people&#x27;s days by making gifting easy, while building a sustainable business on that market opportunity.

We&#x27;re looking for engineers who like to build at a startup pace, have a critical eye for detail and user experience, and thrive when given autonomy and ownership.

Our product is used by Google, Stripe, Meta, NBCUniversal, Notion, and others, and we also offer a developer API for commerce.

Take a look at our application (and a cool WebGL thing I built for it) at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ongoody.com&#x2F;swe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ongoody.com&#x2F;swe</a> and feel free to email me at mark@ongoody.com.
