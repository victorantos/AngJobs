Unite Us - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uniteus.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uniteus.com</a> - Senior Data Scientist - REMOTE (US) - Full-Time - $130k - $160k

Unite Us’ mission is to unlock the potential of every community. Our co-founders started Unite Us in 2013 to serve the people with whom they served. They witnessed firsthand the barriers and inefficiencies in trying to navigate health and social services, and set out to improve that experience for veterans and their families. Unite Us quickly expanded to serving all people who need connections to care across our country. Through Unite Us’ national network and software, community-based organizations, government agencies, and healthcare organizations are all connected to better collaborate to meet the needs of the individuals in their communities. We drive the collaboration to predict, deliver, and pay for services that impact whole-person health.

On the Data Science team, you&#x27;ll support and drive a variety of projects, from more traditional predictive analytics to using Large Language Models to better the way we serve communities.
