yeet - REMOTE &#x2F; Chicago, IL (Prefer US Based) - Full Time

Building a first of its kind dynamic runtime on top of the BPF virtual machine inside the Linux kernel!

Looking for people who have a passion for systems programming, data visualization, real-time computer networking, distributed systems, indexing data at a high volume and making extremely snappy &#x2F; performant frontend UIs in React &#x2F; WebAssembly.

Huge plus if you are an expert in multi-threaded Rust &#x2F; kernel programming. We got a few already but are always looking for more.

If that doesn&#x27;t scare you, We also have work in Python for our backend, React &#x2F; WebAssembly for our frontend and Terraform for our DevOps.

Please e-mail:

work@yeet.cx

Launching imminently.
