Authentik Security - Senior Engineer - US - REMOTE (anywhere) - Full-time

Authentik Security (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goauthentik.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goauthentik.io</a>) is the company behind authentik (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;goauthentik&#x2F;authentik">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;goauthentik&#x2F;authentik</a>), an open source identity provider with 1M+ unique installations. Help us replace Okta&#x2F;Auth0, Ping Identity, and Microsoft Entra with modern, secure identity for all!

We are a small remote team, looking to scale up with experienced software engineers, primarily with a backend focus. Bonus points if you have significant experience with identity&#x2F;SSO standards and&#x2F;or Django&#x2F;Python.

There is also the opportunity to be &quot;forward deployed&quot; spending 20%+ of time with enterprise customers (remotely) on configuration best practices and rollout strategies, _if_ that is of interest to the right candidate.
