Sourcetable is hiring a product educator (contract), in San Francisco. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com</a>

Sourcetable is the world&#x27;s most capable AI spreadsheet (think: &quot;Cursor for spreadsheets&quot;). We&#x27;re a small team of experienced engineers, the company is growing quickly, and and we&#x27;re looking for an experienced product educator to make videos and blogs on everything spreadsheet, data, analysis, and AI related. Personality wise, you could be a fit if you&#x27;re something of a combination YouTuber, hacker, and ex-Goldman Sachs spreadsheet junkie.

Although it isn&#x27;t definitionally required for the role, everyone on the team codes and ideally you do too. We have found it works better that way.

If you are considering applying, please email me a body of work.
