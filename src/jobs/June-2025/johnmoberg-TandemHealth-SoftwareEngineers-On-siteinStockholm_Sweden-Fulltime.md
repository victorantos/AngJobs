Tandem Health - Software Engineers - On-site in Stockholm, Sweden - Full time

At Tandem Health we&#x27;re building a clinician copilot to allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and already have &gt;500 organizations using our product.

Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they&#x27;re much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn&#x27;t be happier :)

We&#x27;re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript&#x2F;React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. We&#x27;re scaling rapidly in terms of # of users and are especially keen to talk to senior backend engineers who have helped startups scale from thousands to millions of users.

Even if we don’t have a role out for your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.
