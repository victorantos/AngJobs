Tram Case - Hiring Head of Engineering (LAX), Tech Lead, Backend, Full Stack &amp; AI Engineers(Remote, LATAM only) - Spanish &amp; English required

We’re building AI-powered tools to help law firms work faster, smarter, and with less busywork.

Our first module is an AI call center that transcribes and classifies calls to help teams prioritize urgent cases. But that’s just one piece — we’re building an end-to-end platform that automates the entire case lifecycle, from intake to resolution.

We’re a small, senior team based in LATAM. You’ll work directly with the founders and ship new features from scratch. No layers of approval, no legacy code — just thoughtful product work, shipped fast.

We’re hiring a Head of Engineering (based in Los Angeles), a Tech Lead (LATAM or LA), and Backend, Full Stack, and AI Engineers (LATAM only). All roles are remote, except Head of Engineering, which is LA-based with flexibility for hybrid work.

Tech stack: Python, JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript, ML&#x2F;AI pipelines in AWS.
