At Continua (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;</a>), we&#x27;ve built an AI agent that users can invite into group conversations to make planning, coordination, and information retrieval effortless. We&#x27;ve seen extremely rapid growth over the last few months, and we want you to help us improve the quality of our agent experience and scale to the next level. Try adding 332-286-3377 to group texts to kick its tires.

I&#x27;m David (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dpetrou&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dpetrou&#x2F;</a>), the founder and CEO, and I was a Distinguished Software Engineer at Google. Continua is backed by tier-1 VCs. Our team (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;team" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;continua.ai&#x2F;team</a>) is a fantastic bunch of accomplished engineers and researchers from Google, Slack, Disney, and AI startups. We&#x27;re pretty clued in on the technology side and have a strong vision of how the transformative technology of the last few years along with our own secret sauce (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) can help a huge number of people.

You&#x27;ll work on building and improving the best LLM group chat experience there is, including fine-tuning models to boost conversational quality and improve scalability and identifying novel ways to build a &quot;memory&quot; which leads to a personalized and unique experience for our users.

You&#x27;re an experienced (Senior&#x2F;Staff) machine learning engineer with broad knowledge and skills and have experience fine-tuning LLMs for both generative and discriminative use cases. You have a PhD in Machine Learning (or a Master’s or Bachelor’s with exceptional industry experience). You understand what it means to work at a fast-moving startup, and you&#x27;re based in Seattle (SEA), San Francisco (SFO), or New York (NYC).

We compensate with a competitive salary and equity, health benefits, 401k, and the opportunity to help shape the future of AI agents during this transformative moment in computing history!
