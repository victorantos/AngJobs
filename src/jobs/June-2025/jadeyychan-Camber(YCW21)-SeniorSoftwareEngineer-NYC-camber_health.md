Camber (YC W21) - Senior Software Engineer - NYC - Onsite &#x2F; Hybrid - camber.health

Camber (fka Juniper) operates at the messy financial infrastructure for US Healthcare. We&#x27;ve built an automated end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.

At Camber, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. We’ve built something really good, something that clinicians really need and love. We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles.

We are a team of ~40 with strong product market fit — in Q4 last year we’ve had to push out onboarding because engineering can’t build quickly enough, something we’ve scaled out of. You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get clinicians back to work delivering care for kids.
