Galaxy (getgalaxy.io) - The Cursor for SQL - NYC, NY - Full time
-- Founding Frontend Engineer
-- Founding Backend Engineer
-- Founding Machine Learning Engineer

We are building the unified data platform, starting with a reimagined SQL editor from the ground up - and moving into sharing, collaboration, access controls, and more.

We just launched the alpha product TODAY to a list of over ~2,000 people on our waitlist

Myself and a handful of super deep data &#x2F; SW engineers started Galaxy as a passion project to solve 3 key problems:

1. *Queries everywhere* – SQL lives in Slack snippets, BI folders, dusty Git repos, and copy-pasted Notion pages.

2. *Never-ending data requests* – because no one can find (or trust) the right query, engineers and analytics teams still get pinged for “one more pull.”

3. ChatGPT doesn’t have full DB context - non technical users are writing incorrect SQL that lacks context AND technical users are rewriting the same queries over and over again

LOOKING FOR: We&#x27;re looking for high agency, high velocity individuals and someone who wants to be part of a family. We are building ~the unified data platform~ and want someone who is excited to be part of the story.
