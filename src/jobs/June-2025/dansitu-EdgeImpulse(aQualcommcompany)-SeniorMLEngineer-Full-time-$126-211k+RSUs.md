Edge Impulse (a Qualcomm company) - Senior ML Engineer - REMOTE in NY&#x2F;NJ&#x2F;CT - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.qualcomm.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job&#x2F;446705785653" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.qualcomm.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;job&#x2F;446705785653</a> - $126-211k + RSUs

Edge Impulse (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edgeimpulse.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edgeimpulse.com</a>) is the top developer platform for edge AI: think HuggingFace but for models that process sensor data on the edge. We have a large and active community of hundreds of thousands of developers. We were recently acquired by Qualcomm, who have a crazy ambitious vision for bringing AI within reach of every embedded engineer.

This role will involve leadership, mentoring, and process design in addition to engineering, software architecture, and programming. There will be room to grow and potentially manage others as we expand the research team from 6 to 10+ researchers and engineers. Your role is to be the professional software engineer in a room full of researchers. You view writing great software as a craft, and you enjoy designing systems to facilitate quality code.

Our team literally wrote the book on AI at the Edge (from O’Reilly <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a.co&#x2F;d&#x2F;dIDZui0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a.co&#x2F;d&#x2F;dIDZui0</a>)—along with creating award-winning technologies like our FOMO constrained object detection architecture, FOMO-AD visual anomaly detection, and EON Compiler model optimization system. Our platform is cited in thousands of research papers, and we are a Gartner Cool Vendor in Edge Computing.

Like the rest of our team, you are naturally proactive and autonomous, and will go the extra mile when required: not by working late, but by going outside of your lane to help deliver the best possible product for our developers. We prize trust, collaboration, entrepreneurialism, and creativity.
