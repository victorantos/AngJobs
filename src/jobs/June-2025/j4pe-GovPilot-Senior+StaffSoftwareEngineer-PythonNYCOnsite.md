GovPilot - Senior + Staff Software Engineer - Python NYC Onsite - C# NYC + remote

I&#x27;m CTO of a bootstrapped civic tech provider powering hundreds of local and county governments across 40+ states and 3 countries. We provide 150+ services from marriage licenses to construction projects to tax assessments.

Now we&#x27;re building out AI concierges to make citizens&#x27; interactions with their governments fast and easy, and to make accessing government data and building workflows on it as simple as asking a question.

We&#x27;re growing fast, our market is incredibly behind the times (we&#x27;ve upgraded customers from a paper map and hand compass onto GIS), and we generate unique first-party data that&#x27;s priceless in many other markets. Come help us help citizens and build something that matters.
