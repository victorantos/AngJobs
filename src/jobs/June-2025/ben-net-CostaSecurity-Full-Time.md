Costa is building Zero-Trust AI infrastructure to help enterprises safely deploy and scale agentic AI. Our product enables enterprises to create powerful AI agents and workflows—accessible via app or API—without compromising on security.

Our founding team previously built a zero-trust platform for securing complex enterprise environments—experience that gives us a unique edge in solving the hardest problems in AI security. Now, we’re building on that foundation with an AI Gateway that delivers enterprise-grade access, control, and performance for the next generation of AI tools.

We’re an experienced startup team, with our CEO having taken his last company public.

We&#x27;re hiring for two roles:

&gt; Staff &#x2F; Lead Engineer

- Strong experience designing and building production systems end-to-end

- Deep expertise with Ruby and Rails

- Hands-on experience building with AI tools and working with emerging AI Protocols (MCP, A2A)

- You lead with curiosity and ship with urgency

&gt; Software Engineer

- 2–5 years of experience

- Experience with Rails and Turbo

- You’ve shipped real features and want to level up fast in 
a high-ownership environment

- Interest in secure systems and modern AI application development

We&#x27;re mainly based in Chicago and the Bay Area, but we are open to remote team members available in US time-zones. We value clarity, action, and building things that last.
