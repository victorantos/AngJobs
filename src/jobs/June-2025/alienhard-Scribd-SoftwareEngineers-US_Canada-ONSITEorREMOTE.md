Scribd - Software Engineers - US, Canada - ONSITE or REMOTE

Scribd is a reading subscription that gives you access to the best books, audiobooks, documents, slide decks, and more. Our mission is to change how the world reads. We have 2M+ paying subscribers. In 2020 we acquired SlideShare. Last year we launched www.everand.com&#x2F;. We are one of the oldest YC startups (YC &#x27;06), operating one of the largest Ruby on Rails sites, serving +200M unique visitors monthly. Learn more about our tech at [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.scribd.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.scribd.com</a>](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.scribd.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.scribd.com&#x2F;</a>).

We have a very friendly, people-first, engineering-driven culture with competitive salary and great benefits. We are ambitious but at the same time value a good work life balance.

A key role I&#x27;m personally hiring at the moment:

*Senior Engineering Manager, Payments &amp; Billing*

This is a strategic and deeply technical role: you’d own the architecture and execution of our global payments and billing platform, serving over 2 million subscribers across 40+ countries. We’re looking for a leader who thrives in complex systems and stays deeply technical – someone who partners closely with their team and contributes meaningfully to technical decisions.

This team owns our full monetization platform, including subscription lifecycle management, payment orchestration, fraud prevention, compliance, and observability. It’s a high-leverage role with direct impact on revenue, customer experience, and global scale.
