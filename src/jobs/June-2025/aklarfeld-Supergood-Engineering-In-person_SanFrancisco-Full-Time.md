Supergood - Engineering - In-person, San Francisco - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supergood.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supergood.ai</a>

Supergood generates and maintains unofficial APIs for products without them. Our customers use our APIs to unlock new customers of their own, and build previously inconceivable features without flaky browser automation nor engineering overhead.

Supergood does this by combining our AI-powered product that automates reverse-engineering, with our in-house observability platform to ensure that every API we generate is reliable, robust and consistently maintained.

We&#x27;ve raised $4mm in seed funding from top operators including Max &amp; Nellie Levchin (CEO&#x2F;Founder Affirm + Paypal) and Zach Perret (CEO of Plaid).

We are looking for full-stack and customer-facing engineers to build new integrations on our platform, support our customers and come up with new and creative ways to showcase our product.
