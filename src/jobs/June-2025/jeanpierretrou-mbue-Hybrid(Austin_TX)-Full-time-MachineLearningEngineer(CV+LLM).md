mbue - Hybrid (Austin, TX) - Full-time - Machine Learning Engineer (CV + LLM) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mbue.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mbue.ai</a>

We’re automating architectural review in construction.
mbue is an AI-first startup helping commercial contractors catch costly mistakes in architectural drawings before they’re built. Our Smart Overlays go beyond Bluebeam by detecting subtle, scope-impacting changes using computer vision and LLMs. We’re backed by top investors and growing fast. Now we’re hiring ML Engineers to build, ship, and own production models end-to-end.

Tech: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Transformers, ViTs, CNNs, LLMs

What you&#x27;ll do:

* Build &amp; deploy deep learning models to analyze and compare architectural drawings

* Tackle noisy, multimodal input: plan sets + spec text

* Own models from prototype to production

* Collaborate to deliver user-facing features

* Move fast and take full ownership

What we&#x27;re looking for:

* 3+ years of hands-on ML experience (CV, DL, and&#x2F;or LLMs)

* Strong Python + ML fundamentals

* Experience shipping models in production

* Startup experience or zero-to-one mentality

* Based in Austin or open to relocating (hybrid role)

This isn’t an R&amp;D role—it’s for builders who want their models in the hands of real users. If you&#x27;re excited to reshape how the built world gets made, we’d love to meet you.
