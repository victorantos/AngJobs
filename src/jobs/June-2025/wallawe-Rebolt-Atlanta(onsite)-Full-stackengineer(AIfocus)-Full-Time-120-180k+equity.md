Rebolt - Atlanta (onsite) - Full-stack engineer (AI focus) - Full-Time - 120-180k + equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rebolthq.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rebolthq.com</a>

We&#x27;ve raised $4.6M to date to help home service businesses (think HVAC, plumbing, landscaping, roofing) with their digital marketing, building everything with an AI-first mindset.

We are a small team still (16 total in the company).

I&#x27;m the founder&#x2F;CEO and have 13 years experience as an SWE so we very much take an engineering-first approach. If you&#x27;re interested and your Github profile goes back to at least 2019, email me directly - will[@]rebolthq.com
