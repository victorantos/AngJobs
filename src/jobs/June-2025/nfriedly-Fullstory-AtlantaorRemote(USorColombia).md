Fullstory - Atlanta or Remote (US or Colombia) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;</a>

Fullstory provides privacy-preserving session replay and analytics for websites and mobile apps. Our session replays are nothing short of magical - they look almost like a video of the user&#x27;s screen - and the combination with analytics creates eye-opening insights.

We have several engineering roles open. The fullstack roles are going to be working with Go (golang), gRPC, Solr, BigQuery&#x2F;BigTable, Kubernetes (K8S&#x2F;GKE), and more on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for the backend, and then TypeScript &amp; React for the frontend.

USA:

* Senior Software Engineer, Full-stack, Application Experience - $160,000 to $190,000 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1a014b19-d805-4547-9ad5-d4c2c6fb8277&#x2F;?ashby_jid=1a014b19-d805-4547-9ad5-d4c2c6fb8277&amp;utm_source=092xpqyAkV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1a014b19-d805-4547-9a...</a>

* Senior Software Engineer, iOS - Objective-C, Swift, Rust, and smaller amounts of other languages. This role is part reverse engineering, part systems programming, and part library development. It&#x27;s about taking things apart, seeing what makes them tick, and figuring out how to get at the bits we need without negatively impacting the app experience (or using any private APIs!) Low-level knowledge of Swift and SwiftUI would be particularly helpful. - $176,000 to $207,500 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;ab3f8ecb-ee1f-4431-a05e-b333c8589a8a&#x2F;?ashby_jid=ab3f8ecb-ee1f-4431-a05e-b333c8589a8a&amp;utm_source=092xpqyAkV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;ab3f8ecb-ee1f-4431-a0...</a>

For the US roles, in addition to the listed pay ranges, you can expect regular raises &amp; bonuses, equity, and benefits including: health insurance, 401k matching (Vanguard), annual learning stipend, unlimited PTO, and more. I take about 5 weeks vacation a year, in addition to ~3 weeks worth of company holidays (federal holidays + the week of Christmas to New Years.)

You also get a 5-week sabbatical after 5 years of employment - I just took mine at the end of last year, and it was fantastic.
