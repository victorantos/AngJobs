Conduit - Product Engineer - San Francisco (Hybrid) - Full-Time

We (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloconduit.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloconduit.com</a>) are building Air Traffic Control for warehouses. We help supply chains handle thousands of trucks and shipments every single day and move the physical economy forward. As the operating system for shipping and receiving, we serve one of the largest, most important industries in the world. Logistics teams depend on us every single day, and we have proof that we make their operations more profitable, safer, and more secure.

We’re looking for a product-minded engineer to help accelerate our efforts in building the operating system for shipping and receiving at warehouses. We believe that there is tremendous value to be created by working closely with our customers and bringing modern solutions to their problems. We’re growing rapidly month by month, and delivering new features that delight our users on a daily basis.

Our ideal candidate would have 3+ years of full-stack experience, but the most important trait is an appetite to learn and get stuff done.

This is a hybrid role based in San Francisco. We are typically in the office Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, but are generally flexible.
