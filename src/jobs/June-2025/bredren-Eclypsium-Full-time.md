Eclypsium - Portland, OR (USA) &amp; Córdoba (ARGENTINA) - ONSITE &#x2F; HYBRID - Full-time

We build supply-chain security that protects every device from chip to cloud.
Fortune-100s and federal agencies run us in production, and we&#x27;re growing two
core teams:

• Senior Software Engineer – Portland  
  ∘ Go &#x2F; Python back-end, REST &amp; gRPC APIs  
  ∘ GCP, Docker, Terraform, Postgres, CI&#x2F;CD  
  ∘ 5 + yrs building production services

• Platform Architect – Córdoba  
  ∘ Design &amp; code our next-gen SaaS platform (GCP + K8s)  
  ∘ Own scalability, reliability, security from day 1  
  ∘ 7 + yrs distributed-systems &#x2F; cloud architecture  
  → <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclypsium.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-667280-platform-architect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclypsium.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#op-667280-platform-ar...</a>

We are AI positive! Both positions will benefit if filled by people well-versed in use of AI to assist their existing deep experience in SWE to accelerate design, administration and implementation.

Why we like it here  
Startup-speed, no politics, real customer impact, equity, full health cover,
flex PTO, parental leave.

I&#x27;ll be in *Córdoba 6&#x2F;2–6&#x2F;7*, visiting from HQ in Portland—happy to grab
coffee or maté and talk shop.

I was found by Eclypsium from my posting in the Who Wants to be Hired thread here on HN. This is the company&#x27;s first post in the Who&#x27;s Hiring AFAIK. So, the opportunities above are real.

Please send me an email at rob.banagale@eclypsium.com to ask questions or get an intro going, you&#x27;re welcome to also apply using the instructions on the job postings page but please also shoot me a note!  I hope to hear from you.
