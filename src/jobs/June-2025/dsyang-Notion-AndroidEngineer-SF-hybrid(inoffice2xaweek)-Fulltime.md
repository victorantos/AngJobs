Notion’s looking for more android engineers to join our Mobile Product pod and help us build more high-quality, mobile-first experiences. Our Android app began as a shell that ran the web app in a webview that we’ve increasingly ported to Kotlin and Compose. This greatly improved app performance[1] and has unlocked the potential for more delightful mobile UX. Some example projects you might work on include: making Notion AI actually useful on mobile, making it dramatically faster to view notion pages, and building more mobile-native integrations to help our users be productive on-the-go.
