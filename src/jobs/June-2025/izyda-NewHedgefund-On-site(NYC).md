New Hedge fund - Sr&#x2F;Staff Frontend Engineer - On-site (NYC)

We are a new discretionary, tech industry focused hedge fund, founded by a portfolio manager with 15+ years of experience at a Tiger Cub. I lead the data&#x2F;technology team here and previously spent ~6 years in a similar role at a well known Tiger Cub.

We are hiring for a frontend senior&#x2F;staff engineer for our internal research management web application.

Our tech stack: * Frontend: Typescript, Vue3 * Backend: Cloudflare, Supabase&#x2F;Postgresql, Typescript *

Obviously, we are not the only ones trying to figure out how to use AI in investing but in a world where there are lots of people trying to build picks &amp; shovels, this is an opportunity to be one of the goldminers at a greenfield, new firm. This role makes sense for people who are interested in finance&#x2F;investing (although you do not necessarily have to have experience in the industry).

We&#x27;re in full-time in office in NYC, so that&#x27;s a requirement for FTE. We are potentially open to exceptional contractors located remotely.

We work very hard, hours are long, and people are very dedicated to the mission. It is not for everyone, but for those interested in competing in financial markets, love startup atmosphere without near-term existential risk, and want to work with super smart colleagues (both technical and investors!), this could be a great fit.

Target salary 180-250K, depending on experience + Bonus&#x2F;Carry (hedge fund equity equivalent)
