nao Labs - [Staff, Senior] AI Engineer - Paris or remote (Europe) - Python, Typescript, React

We are building Cursor for data teams. Using nao, data practitioners can work on data pipelines using AI faster without breaking stuff. nao connects to your data warehouse &#x2F; lake and helps users give the correct data context to the AI so it does not hallucinate.

What we are looking for: an Senior AI engineer with proven experience on LLM training, fine-tuning, inference and deployment. We have codegen models dedicated for data code (Python and SQL) and we want to be the best at this. In nao, AI powers the chat experience (agent) and the Tab (autocomplete and next action).

We are a YC company and we want to be the next daily tool every data people are using. I can also be a Founding engineer position.
