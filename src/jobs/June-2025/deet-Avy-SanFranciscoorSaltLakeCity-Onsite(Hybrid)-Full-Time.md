Avy - Staff Engineer &#x2F; Startup Polyglot Engineer - San Francisco or Salt Lake City - Onsite (Hybrid) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avy.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.avy.ai</a>

We are an early-stage, well-funded startup making humans and computers work together more efficiently. Experienced team from Apple AIML and other great companies.

We will be opening several roles soon, but are previewing this one early: Staff Engineer &#x2F; Startup Polyglot Engineer.

You&#x27;ll enjoy this role if:

- You like going 0 to 1 with high ownership: moving features and products from idea on a napkin, to prototype, to engineering UI, to shipped and polished product

- You are innovative, get satisfaction out of learning new things, and thrive in an environment of uncertainty and opportunity

To succeed, you should:

- Have the wisdom to know when to take the fast route vs when to step back and clean up your mess

- Be capable and excel on your own, but be humble and communicate well with others as projects require more collaboration

- Be versed across many programming languages (e.g. from C++&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Swift to Go to JavaScript or Python)

- Have worked on many types of projects and software -- have you built servers, written games, shipped native apps, and vibe-coded (kidding) web apps? If so, you&#x27;re a fit.

- Be versatile and work both high level and low level, on old tech and new. Have you both prompt-engineered an LLM AND tweaked the code that decodes tokens in your own local LLM runner? If so, you&#x27;re a fit.

All said, we&#x27;re looking for the stereotypical &quot;startup engineer&quot; who can move between different components, be creative, be flexible, take ownership, and get things done. We have a complex, challenging product, but one that&#x27;s amazing to work on and that will soon change how people think about working with each other and with AI.
