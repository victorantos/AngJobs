Tower - Founding Engineers, DevRel - Berlin - Full time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towerjobs.notion.site&#x2F;jobs-at-tower" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towerjobs.notion.site&#x2F;jobs-at-tower</a>

We&#x27;re building a serverless data platform that helps data scientists and data engineers build leaner data stacks and own their data. We&#x27;re powered by Apache Iceberg and a whole collection of open source tools that we try to contribute upstream to as much as we can!

I&#x27;m looking to hire two founding engineers and someone on the DevRel side. If you&#x27;re interested, my email is in my profile! Or you can apply via our site.
