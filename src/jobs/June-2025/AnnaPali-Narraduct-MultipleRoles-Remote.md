Narraduct - Multiple Roles - Remote - Full time &amp; Part time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narraduct.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narraduct.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>

Narraduct is a commodities focused consultancy and hedge fund, building tools for mining and energy companies, primarily in Central Asia and S. America. Knowledge of accounting, chemistry, geology or industrial engineering is a huge bonus. We appreciate knowledge of multiple languages and curiosity about exotic paradigms. More than anything, we look for people who will fit in and help us create value. We can make roles for good fits!

We primarily use Common Lisp, with some Go, Racket and Prolog running on Linux and BSD. Some client facing stuff may feature Tcl or Clojure. We are also looking for a graphic designer or ui&#x2F;ux expert who like preweb style interfaces with prouser experiences.

Note, half of compensation takes form of bonuses. As most employees are remote around the world with different regulatory environments, we can&#x27;t offer traditional benefits.
