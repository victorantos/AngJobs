Goody - Remote - $170-230K + equity and benefits - Full-time

Goody is hiring a full-stack Senior Software Engineer who likes to ship at a startup pace and has an eye for exceptional UI&#x2F;UX.

I&#x27;m Mark, the technical co-founder and CTO at Goody. Despite being something everyone does, gifting is one of the areas of commerce yet to be disrupted. Our goal is to make people&#x27;s days by making gifting easy, while building a sustainable business on that market opportunity.

We&#x27;re looking for engineers who like to build at a startup pace, have a critical eye for detail and user experience, and thrive when given autonomy and ownership.

Our product is used by Google, Stripe, Anthropic, Meta, NBCUniversal, Notion, and others, and we also offer a developer API for commerce.
