Carebit - Full Stack Support Engineer (Ruby on Rails, TypeScript&#x2F;JS, React, Postgres, Linux) - Fully Remote (European timezones only) - Full-Time - Up To £80k&#x2F;$100k&#x2F;year DOE

About Carebit

[Carebit](<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carebit.co" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carebit.co</a>) is a young, design-led healthcare technology company helping over 1500 private doctors across the UK run their practices more effectively and efficiently with our web and mobile platform, along with hundreds of thousands of their patients. For too long, medical software has been clunky, user-hostile and complicated, and we are changing that. Several customers have independently described us as ’the Apple of practice management software’.

We are a bootstrapped, profitable and remote-first company of 30 people with 6 full stack engineers including the company’s founder, Dominic. Having been remote from day 1, we fully believe in its benefits. We do have a lovely office in London by the river for in-person collaboration when required, but this is not mandatory as we know some like in-person working and some prefer fully remote!

About you

We’re looking for a Senior Support Engineer to work with our Support and Data Migration teams for day to day work troubleshooting and resolving technical customer issues. We’re specifically after someone who is curious, experienced and enjoys investigating and solving technical issues that vary from fixing simple bugs to small tweaks to existing features (e.g. adding a new column to a CSV export) to writing Ruby scripts to execute changes after a data migration to Carebit.

You’ll likely have a strong software development background already. This is a hands-on role where you’ll be regularly shipping fixes and improvements to the core Carebit platform as well.

- Strong experience with Ruby on Rails and React, especially design patterns (we use Rails 7 and Ruby 3.4 with Postgres 17, deployed to AWS ECS)
- Bonus points for Linux&#x2F;sysadmin and Postgres knowledge
- Fluent in written and verbal English and an excellent, timely communicator - especially with customers
- Self-disciplined, autonomous, motivated, and able to manage concurrent tasks

This is a fully remote role but we operate on London, UK time and so are only considering candidates in GMT&#x2F;BST ±3 time zones who are willing to work to UK hours (typically 9am-5.30pm)
