Terradot - Data Science, Machine Learning, Computational Research, Statistics - ONSITE in San Francisco, CA or São Paulo, BR - Full-Time

Terradot is a carbon removal company founded out of Stanford University. We are advancing the science and technology of Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW), a carbon removal pathway that leverages earth’s natural weathering cycle to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere at the gigaton scale. We just raised ~$60M in funding and have sold 300k tons of offtakes from leading CDR buyers like Frontier and Google.

We’re looking for quantitative-research-type folks interested in working in a high-performance science and engineering team to develop an engine to jointly quantify and predict CO2 removal in ERW projects. It’s a tough problem spanning geochemical modeling, geostatistical modeling, and integration of complex environmental data. Some domain background appreciated but not required. We&#x27;re currently working in Python &amp; Julia. Let&#x27;s draw down some carbon.
