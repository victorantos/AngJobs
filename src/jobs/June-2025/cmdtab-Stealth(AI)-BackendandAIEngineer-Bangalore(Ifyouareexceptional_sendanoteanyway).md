Stealth (AI) - Backend and AI Engineer - Bangalore (If you are exceptional, send a note anyway)

Weâ€™re building a general purpose automation platform to allow your grandma to automate anything a person can do online.

Think manus.im but repeatable and reliable.

If the problem excites you and you want to work on tough problems like optimizing how to spin up millions of computer instances with synchronization cost effectively, figure out how to package android on firecracker, create new DSLs or find new ways to optimize context and reliability of AI agents, shoot me an email with your github or portfolio. (See bio)

We work autonomously with engineers taking product decisions and very future leaning team.
