Edra Labs - Full-Time - Equity - New York &amp; London (No remote) - AI Engineers &#x2F; Full-Stack Engineers

At Edra we built a new, proprietary method of learning that allows LLMs to understand and automate business processes.

Founded by Eugen and Yannis, former co-heads of Forward Deployed AI Engineering at Palantir. We believe that as we get closer to AGI, the ability to teach models what you want them to do will become the key bottleneck in deployment to enterprises, and traditional training approaches won’t cut it. We named the company Edra for “the seat of the teacher”.

Edra AI is a novel learning system, deployed with several customers and are looking to scale up. Backed by top-tier investors from the Palantir ecosystem with offices in New York and London.

Still in stealth, reach out to hiring@edra.ai for more.

We’re hiring:

- AI Engineers (New York&#x2F;London): You’ll work on building the future of AI whitebox learning

- Full-Stack Product Engineers (London): Help us deliver a fast and powerful user-facing platform.
Stack includes Next.js, TypeScript, FastAPI, Python, and Postgres.
