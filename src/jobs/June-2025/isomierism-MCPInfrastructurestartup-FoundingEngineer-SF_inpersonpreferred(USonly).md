MCP Infrastructure startup - Founding Engineer - SF, in person preferred (US only)

We&#x27;re a team out of google systems research building solutions to problems related to delegation of trust, permissioning, authenticity, and tool discovery for an agentic internet. We&#x27;re early on our architecture and there&#x27;s a healthy dosage of venture interest as well as stamps of approval from folks who are deep in the search community (read: many early google employees who want to back it) and would love to talk if this sounds interesting (can send over a one pager)
