Sutro - Senior Full-Stack Engineer - REMOTE - Full time

At Sutro, we&#x27;re building the next generation AI-native no-code platform. Our code base is mostly written in TypeScript, with React (Native) for the frontend, with a particular focus on complex agentic workflows and many patterns from the fields of compilers and the theory of software languages.

We are looking for an experienced full-stack engineer with experience in architecting agentic workflows, building tasteful UIs, and knowledge in the field of compilers and software architecture theory.

Our primary location is Oakland, CA, and as such, our core working hours with everyone online are 8 am-11 am California time. Feel free to hit me up with questions!
