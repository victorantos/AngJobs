Good Pair Days - Lead Engineer, Fullstack - Full-Time - REMOTE (Australia +- 1h) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodpairdays.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodpairdays.com</a> - AUD $150,000 to $250,000 + Stock Options

Profitable wine-subscription scale-up (tens of millions ARR) that used ML for personalised recommendations before &quot;AI&quot; was cool. Own and scale the whole stack (React&#x2F;React Native, Python&#x2F;Django, GraphQL, Postgres, AWS), ship new AI-native features, chase latency spikes, and grow the team from 1 â†’ 5+.

You&#x27;re a commercial thinker who speaks unit economics, retention levers, and gross margin as fluently as REST endpoints; resourceful, data-driven, ops-literate, and never stops tinkering with the latest models.

Comp up to A$250k + meaningful equity.

You can email me directly (&quot;beto&quot; at our domain name specified above and the subject line as &quot;From Hacker News - Remote - {your country}&quot;) with (1) a tech decision you owned and its business impact, and (2) the first AI experiment you&#x27;d run at GPD.
