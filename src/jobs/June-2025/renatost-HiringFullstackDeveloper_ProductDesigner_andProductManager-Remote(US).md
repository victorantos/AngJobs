Klutch (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.klutchcard.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.klutchcard.com</a>) - Hiring Fullstack Developer, Product Designer, and Product Manager - Remote (US)

Klutch is building the platform for financial mini-apps.

We&#x27;re not just a credit card—we’re creating an extensible platform where powerful mini-apps help users control, understand, and automate their finances. From budgeting tools that prevent overspending to AI-driven insights that surface patterns in your spending, Klutch lets users shape how their credit card works for them.

Our core belief: financial products should be programmable, transparent, and intelligent.

We&#x27;re looking for builders to help shape this vision:

Fullstack Developer – Kotlin + React. You&#x27;ll ship end-to-end features, build new mini-apps, and contribute to the internal platform that powers them.

Product Designer – Help define a UX model for composable finance—where users can mix and match tools that feel tailored to them.

Product Manager – Own a domain like AI Insights or Budget Controls. You&#x27;ll define the roadmap, talk to users, and launch products quickly.

We use Kotlin (Exposed, Ktor), React + Next.js, AWS (Fargate, Lambda), MySQL, and Mongo. Our stack also supports integrating AI models directly into mini-apps.

If you’re passionate about redefining how people interact with money—and want to help build a platform others can build on too—we’d love to talk.
