Stored - Full Stack&#x2F;Backend Engineer (C#, TypeScript, Postgres) - Fully Remote (European timezones only) - Full-Time

We&#x27;re Stored – a digital payments startup redefining how merchants sell and get paid. We recently closed an oversubscribed funding round, driven by several new partnership agreements with some of the world&#x27;s largest payments businesses.

You’ll be joining a small team where your work will have immediate and visible impact. The majority of the backend has been built by one of our founders, and you&#x27;ll work closely with them to help take it to the next level.

What we’re looking for:

-Strong experience with C# and back end systems.

-Deep understanding of Postgres, performance tuning, batching, and scaling.

-Proficiency in TypeScript, and capable of owning full features end-to-end.

-Comfortable handling front end logic (we use Svelte, but experience with any modern framework like React or Vue is fine). To be clear, you won&#x27;t need to design&#x2F;build UIs, but you should be able to work across the stack.

-Experience with Linux and networking, especially profiling&#x2F;debugging in high-traffic production environments is desirable but not essential

-Fluent in written and verbal English

-Self-disciplined, motivated, and able to manage concurrent tasks

This is a fully remote role, but we’re based out of London, UK and so only considering candidates in GMT&#x2F;BST ±3 time zones who are willing to work between the hours of 8am - 6pm GMT&#x2F;BST.
