Stellar - Implementation Lead, Software Engineer - Amsterdam, Netherlands, EU - Onsite&#x2F;Hybrid - Full-time

We&#x27;re building AI voice agents for enterprise contact centers. We focus on remarkably human-like conversations, regulated environments and support for non-English markets (Dutch, German, French, etc.).

1. Implementation Lead: Lead customer deployments from POC to production. Technical understanding required, coding skills not a requirement. You&#x27;ll work directly with enterprise clients to integrate our AI agents into their existing contact center infrastructure.

2. Software Engineer: Go&#x2F;TypeScript (Encore.dev&#x2F;React). If you&#x27;re strong in other languages, entrepreneurial and eager to learn, we&#x27;d still love to talk. Build core platform features, guardrails, integrations, and tools that help our AI agents handle millions of customer calls.

You&#x27;ll thrive here if you:

- Want high ownership and direct customer impact

- Prefer building directly with users vs. in isolation

- Enjoy technical challenges at the intersection of AI&#x2F;audio&#x2F;enterprise

EU work authorization required. No visa sponsorship available.
