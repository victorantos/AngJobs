Cactus - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cactus.is&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cactus.is&#x2F;</a> - Multiple Roles - REMOTE - Full-Time and Contract

Cactus is a strategy, design, and engineering firm that builds physical and digital products for some of the world&#x27;s leading healthcare clinics. Fully remote with teams based in the US and Brazil, we&#x27;re hiring for a variety of software engineering roles (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cactus.is&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cactus.is&#x2F;careers</a>).

- While we have a few open positions in engineering, we&#x27;re most in need of a QA Agency and&#x2F;or Engineer. We&#x27;re specifically looking for help across web and mobile QA for a variety of ongoing multi-year engagements with our clients in healthcare. Ideally, this individual or agency can help us write test scripts and test cases, execute them, analyze and report defects, and get us from test-to-requirement coverage.

Email careers@cactus.is with your name, github&#x2F;code samples, and resume or LinkedIn. It&#x27;s a plus but not required to have past experience working with healthcare tools and standards like EMRs, HIEs, HIPAA, FHIR, interoperability, etc.
