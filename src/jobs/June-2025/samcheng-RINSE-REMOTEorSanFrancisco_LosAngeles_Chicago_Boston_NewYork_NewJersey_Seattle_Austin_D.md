Rinse provides dry cleaning and laundry delivery services to customers in nine metropolitan areas in the US. We have sophisticated logistics optimization software, a polished consumer product, and firm business fundamentals. We&#x27;re now over a decade old - this is a stable, yet consistently growing and innovating, company.

Our product team is distributed across the United States and internationally, and has been entirely remote for years now, but a desk can be provided in the above cities if you&#x27;d prefer.  Because an IT Associate has some physical hardware responsibilities, we&#x27;d prefer that role be filled by someone in the above localities, even though the vast majority of the role can be performed remotely.

We&#x27;re open to both newly-graduated or more senior technically-minded individuals and managers, provided they meet our bar.

Search term bingo: Logistics, Linux, Django, Testing, QA, Systems Administration, Network Administration, Test Automation, Playwright, Continuous Integration, Release Management, Information Technology, Amazon Web Services, AWS.
