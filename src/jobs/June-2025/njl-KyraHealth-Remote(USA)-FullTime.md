Kyra Health - Python&#x2F;Typescript - Remote (USA) - Full Time

We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve healthcare quality and cost for employers, employees, and insurance companies; regulatory changes and LLMs mean it is time to build. We think we can provide a better experience for less money, and have multiple positive impacts on society. We have the idea, the funding, and the skills and knowledge to make it happen. We&#x27;re looking for a few more strong engineers to help us build it.

Responsibilities

- Research, plan, scope, and design solutions to difficult problems while navigating laws, regulations, and standards in money movement and healthcare.

- Produce elegant and simple code that is architected and written for the long haul.

- Speed up overall development efforts.

- Help build a development environment and operational tooling that will be the envy of companies many times our size.

Must Have

- Strong Python or TypeScript skills, or a strong background in another dynamic language.

- A burning desire to get things out the door and in the hands of users.

- Strong communication skills.
