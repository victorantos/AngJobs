Agentio - Senior Software Engineer - On-site (Brooklyn, NY) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agentio.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agentio.com</a> - $150k–225k + Equity

Agentio is AI-native platform enabling brands like Bombas, DoorDash, and HelloFresh to scale revenue through creator-led advertising—and empowering creators to monetize more efficiently.

We raised our Series A in November from Benchmark (Uber, Snap, Instagram), and we’re solving rich, technical problems across marketplace dynamics, LLM-powered content understanding, and real-time optimization. We’re a small, hands-on team with experience from Spotify, AWS, Twitter, and Pinterest. We&#x27;re building tools used daily and already loved by some of the world’s most sophisticated marketing teams and top creators — with Agentio as the leading revenue source for many — transforming the way they partner.
