Substrate Labs - Founding Engineer - NYC or remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;Substrate-Labs-Founding-Engineer-2067b41a7960803483bddd7953c59edd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;Substrate-Labs-Founding-Engineer-2067b...</a>

Founders Ben [0] and Rob [1] have been friends since meeting at Venmo in 2013. Ben worked at Stripe for 8 years. Rob worked at Fin (human-in-the-loop AI executive assistant, before LLMs) and was founding engineer at Substack. We started our first product, Substrate in 2023, a platform for building agentic workflows, and raised an $8M seed round led by Lightspeed [2]. We were pushing the envelope on both infra (serving multi-model workloads efficiently) and developer experience (ahead of our time in several ways) [3]. Though we found solid traction with startups, we realized inference was a red ocean especially upmarket, and decided to spin down the product&#x2F;team at the end of 2024. We&#x27;ve spent the last 6 months prototyping and discarding ideas, and weâ€™re now gearing up to launch our latest vision, a consumer AI application.
