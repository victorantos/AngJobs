New Lantern - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newlantern.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newlantern.ai</a> - Software engineers (infrastructure engineers &amp; backend-leaning product engineers) - Full time in San Francisco, CA (ONSITE)

New Lantern is hiring software engineers to help build an AI copilot [1] for radiologists.

Radiologists are experts at diagnosing disease in medical images, but they spend over half their working hours on tasks that have nothing to do with diagnosis: reading prior reports, transcribing handwritten notes, taking manual measurements, dictating reports, and chasing down follow-ups. New Lantern is building an AI copilot for radiologists to automate this non-diagnostic work, so radiologists can focus on what they do best: caring for patients and interpreting images.

We are starting to find product-market fit and recently raised a $19M Series A from Benchmark [2]. Demand for our product is growing, and we&#x27;re hiring software engineers in San Francisco to help us scale our product and our team. We work together in person five days a week from our office in Jackson Square.

Engineering is at the heart of New Lantern. Our engineers work directly with our founder&#x2F;CEO, our staff radiologist, and our end users to build features that radiologists rely on daily. Everyone has real ownership and autonomy, moves quickly, and ships meaningful work frequently. We&#x27;re a small, sharp team of frontend, full-stack, and backend engineers building a React-based web app backed by Python services, cloud infrastructure, and LLMs.

I&#x27;m Steve, New Lantern&#x27;s Head of Engineering. If you&#x27;re interested or want to learn more, shoot me a note at (my HN username)@newlantern.ai.

[1] We translate &quot;AI copilot&quot; to &quot;AI radiology resident&quot; when we speak with medical professionals, but the former is the clearest way to communicate what we&#x27;re building here.
