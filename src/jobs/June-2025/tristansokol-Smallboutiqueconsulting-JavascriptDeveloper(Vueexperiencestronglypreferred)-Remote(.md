Small boutique consulting - Javascript Developer (Vue experience strongly preferred) - Remote (US) (some est meetings) - part-time&#x2F;flexible&#x2F;1099 - ~$50&#x2F;hr

Hi! I work with a small group of developers doing custom software development and consulting for small&#x2F;medium businesses. This is a great opportunity for people who value flexibility, maybe SAHMs, new parents, etc. who want to get back into the workforce in a very flexible way. Not a great fit for someone between who wants to do something temporary between jobs, supplemental around their existing full time job or who *need* a stable level of income.

The work is very different by client but not terribly difficult. However, no matter how senior you are there is a pretty low ceiling on what our clients are willing to pay. Our technology stack is anchored in: - JavaScript&#x2F;Node&#x2F;Vue - GCP&#x2F;App Engine&#x2F;Cloud Functions - Jira&#x2F;Confluence&#x2F;Google Workspace

If this sounds interesting and a good fit your lifestyle, reach out to [the two letter acronym for this site]@cookie.bike

PS. Each time I post here I get 3-500 emails, almost all are low effort that don&#x27;t meet the above description, I&#x27;ve hired 3 people from past posts, but it can take some time dig through everyone.
