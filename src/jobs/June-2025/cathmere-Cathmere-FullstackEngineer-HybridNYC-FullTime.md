Cathmere - Fullstack Engineer - Hybrid NYC - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cathmere.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cathmere.com</a>

Cathmere is a seed-stage fintech startup, building a private blockchain-based platform that connects US investors with asset-backed securities based in emerging markets - creating new investment opportunities by providing verifiable data about real-world asset performance.

I&#x27;m looking for one more founding engineer to join our small team and own core platform development. We&#x27;re early in product development and there is still lots of opportunity to shape technical architecture and product direction.

I&#x27;m hiring based on demonstrated experience in engineering excellence and product oriented thinking. Reach me at matt@cathmere.com
