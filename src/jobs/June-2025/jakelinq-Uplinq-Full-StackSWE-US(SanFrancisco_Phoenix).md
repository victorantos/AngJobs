Uplinq - Full-Stack SWE - US (San Francisco, Phoenix) - Onsite&#x2F;Hybrid - 140k - 200k + equity
I&#x27;m the CTO of Uplinq. We&#x27;re automating bookkeeping and accounting for small businesses. Our customers are real people from Main Street America — think Insurance Agents, Dentists, Restaurant Owners, and Realtors. We’re a fast-growing VC-backed startup and just closed our Series A. We&#x27;re looking to add 2 SWEs to our team of 5. Last year we quadrupled ARR ($1M → $4M+) and we&#x27;re on track for $9M+ this year. Your work will directly shape how we get there.

We’re hiring experienced full-stack engineers who aren&#x27;t afraid to learn some bookkeeping. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re focused on this year:

- Scaling&#x2F;Improving our AI Bookkeeper to automate bookkeeping job functions end-to-end

- Improving our document intelligence pipeline (invoices, bank statements, tax forms)

- Creating new experiences for customers to save them time

About You:

- You have 5+ years of experience delivering production software

- You&#x27;re generalist who isn&#x27;t afraid to dive into product, infra, or deep into the domain

- You&#x27;re entrepreneurial-minded and want to work with the founding team of a startup with PMF

React &#x2F; Next.js &#x2F; Tailwind &#x2F; TypeScript &#x2F; tRPC &#x2F; PostgreSQL &#x2F; AWS &#x2F; SST
