Equall - Product Engineer (Full Stack) - NYC (In-Person &#x2F; Hybrid) - Full Time - $150K–$250K depending on experience - dani@equall.com
We’re building the OS for legal risk — a real-time AI platform that does legal work (not a co-pilot). Custom knowledge graphs + multi-agent systems = outputs that replace 100s of lawyer-hours.

You’ll:

- Own and ship full-stack features across SvelteKit, GraphQL, and Python

- Work in person with a high-output team, solving real pain points for top law firms

- Build AI-native product.

Must:

- Be NYC-based (or willing to move)

- Be serious, fast, and ready to work long hours on hard problems

- 2+ years experience

Nice: FastAPI, GraphQL, Tailwind, Svelte, Bun&#x2F;Deno, AI&#x2F;ML infra, structured concurrency
