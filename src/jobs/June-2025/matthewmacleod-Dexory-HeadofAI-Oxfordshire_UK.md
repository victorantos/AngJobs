Dexory - Head of AI - Oxfordshire, UK - Hybrid &#x2F; ONSITE

We’re building the world’s most advanced, real-time warehouse intelligence platform powered by autonomous robots and AI that thinks spatially, reasons like a human, and drives logistics performance instantly.

We’ve nailed the robotics. We’ve scaled the deployments. Now we’re embedding real-time cognition. This is your chance to lead Dexory’s first AI team and architect the brain of the autonomous warehouse.

As Head of AI, you’ll go beyond leading a function; you’ll shape its future. You’ll blend strategic thinking with hands-on building, defining how our platform sees, thinks, learns, and adapts at scale.
