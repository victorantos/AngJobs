Wave3 Social - Marketing Director - Remote

Wave3 is a social club for men looking to build meaningful IRL friendships in the digital era. Our mission is to solve the growing male loneliness crisis. We host monthly mixers and exclusive events for members. The goal is to remove all friction to having the consistent interactions needed to build meaningful relationships.

We launched only last week and had immediate viral success, including reaching front-page of HN, leading to 10k+ unique visitors and hundreds of signups only in 3 cities. Now we are looking for a marketing leader that can help capitalize on that initial momentum by growing social channels, running paid ads, developing partnerships, and expanding to other cities with community managers.
