Flourish Health - Senior Software Engineer - Remote (US) - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flourish.health" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flourish.health</a> - $150-189k

We&#x27;re helping teens and families get the mental health support they deserve. Many of our families are on Medicaid and&#x2F;or in foster care. We build tech that powers care in the real world - apps for our staff (guides, therapist, psychiatrists, ops) and for the families we serve. We&#x27;re mission-driven, moving fast, and grounded in the belief that thoughtful software can genuinely change lives.

We&#x27;re hiring two senior engineers to help us level up as we begin scaling. You’d be joining a tight-knit group of builders: four engineers, our head of product, and me (Josh, co-founder&#x2F;CTO). You’ll work full-stack to ship features, shape the system architecture, improve developer experience, and drive our product forward. You&#x27;ll also get to help us ethically integrate more AI into our app to better support our patients.

Tech stack - Typescript&#x2F;NodeJS - React Native (+RN Web) - MongoDB - Google Cloud

We&#x27;re fully remote, mostly in the midwest for the dev team, great health insurance, 401k matching, 20 days PTO&#x2F;9 sick.

If you&#x27;re interested, email josh at hour website, mention HN, and send me a   link&#x2F;description of something you&#x27;ve built (GitHub, app, side project, blog, etc.)
