ParaFi Capital - San Diego (Hybrid) - Sr. full-stack Engineer

ParaFi is a multi‑strategy investment and technology firm focused on the digital‑asset ecosystem. Since 2018 we’ve partnered with leading institutions to deploy venture, liquid, and quantitative capital. Our edge comes from marrying rigorous research, deep technical capability, and an operator’s mindset. We ship code, contribute to protocols, and build internal systems that keep us a step ahead of the market.

We’re looking for a senior engineer who can wear multiple hats - backend, frontend, data, and DevOps - to accelerate every part of ParaFi’s technology platform. You’ll design and own production systems that ingest billions of on‑chain and market datapoints, power quantitative strategies, and surface realtime insights to the investment team. Expect a high‑trust, low‑bureaucracy environment where your technical decisions directly influence portfolio returns.
