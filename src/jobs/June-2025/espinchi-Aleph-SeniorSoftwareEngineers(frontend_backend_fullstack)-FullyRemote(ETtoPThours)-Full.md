Aleph is an AI-native platform for Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A). We operate in an established software category with a multi-billion market but no clear winner.

Weâ€™re backed by top VCs (Bain Capital Ventures, Khosla Ventures, YC, Picus Capital), and work with customers like Eight Sleep, Webflow, Turo, Notion, Zapier and others.

Our tech stack: TypeScript, React, Python, Mongo, GCP
