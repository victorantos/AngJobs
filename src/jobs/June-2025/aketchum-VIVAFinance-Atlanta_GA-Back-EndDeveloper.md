VIVA Finance - Atlanta, GA -  Back-End Developer

VIVA is a Fintech Startup based in Atlanta, GA with the mission to build a more inclusive financial system. VIVA offers unsecured personal loans to customers who have traditionally been excluded and taken advantage of by the legacy financial institutions. The VIVA difference is to underwrite heavily on employment history and set up repayments through voluntary direct deposit payments from the borrower&#x27;s paycheck. Our interest rates are less than 1&#x2F;3 of the rates our customers are able to get from other financing options.

We are a VC backed company and have been in business for 6 years. We have been profitable for the past year and with a new debt facility closing at the end of June, we will be dramatically ramping up origination volume in the second half of the year. We are hiring an additional backend engineer to support the larger transaction volume, as well as to support new products we plan to launch to diversify our revenue stream. You will join our engineering team of 10 and work in a dynamic environment where you are frequently writing net new code to support business objectives.

Our tech stack for the back-end is fully on AWS, using Lambda and ECS for compute and Typescript as the language, but experience with this specific stack is not necessary for talented candidates. Our preference is candidates who can come in office 4 days a week to our new office on the Atlanta Beltline (next to Krog Street Market). VIVA does not provide visa sponsorship, so please have authorization to work in the USA.

Send an introduction to our hiring manger (alexa@viva-finance.com) with a resume and we will be in touch!
