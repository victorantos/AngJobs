Beacon AI builds R2-D2 for pilots. We are on a mission to make flight safer, more efficient, and accessible for commercial and defense aircraft operators by applying technology to the flight deck. We are building a modern technology stack with a data platform and web application (Lighthouse), and in-cockpit assistant (Murdock).

With new contracts in both defense and commercial aviation, and a $15M Series A in Q3 2024, we’re scaling quickly. We&#x27;re backed by Costanoa, Scout, Sam Altman, and JetBlue Ventures - and we’re hiring across engineering to support our next phase of growth.

We&#x27;re hiring for many Senior and Staff-level positions:

* Edge&#x2F;Autonomy Engineer, Advanced Pilot Assistant Software (C++, Python)

-- This application also works for adjacent roles like tracking, prediction, behavior, or route&#x2F;path planning optimization.

* Backend Engineer (TypeScript, Python)

* iOS Engineer (Swift, SwiftUI)

* Frontend Engineer (React)

* Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, IoT&#x2F;Edge (AWS)

* TPM (Software) and TPM (Federal Programs)
