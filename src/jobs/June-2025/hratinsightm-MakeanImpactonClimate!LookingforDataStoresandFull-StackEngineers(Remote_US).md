Make an Impact on Climate! Looking for Data Stores and Full-Stack Engineers (Remote, US)

At Insight M, we combine innovative aerospace systems with advanced data science. Unlike traditional aerospace companies, we sell information, not hardware - we operate our sensors cost-effectively at a continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problems.

First on our list: spotting hard-to-monitor emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. Since starting continuous survey operations in 2018, Insight M has removed methane emissions equal to over 250 million tonnes of CO2e through our work. To put that in perspective, that’s equivalent to over 60 million cars being removed from the roads or shutting down about one hundred and sixty 350 MW coal-fired power plants for a year. That&#x27;s like planting 4.2 billion urban trees and letting them grow for 10 years.

We call that a good start.

As a team, we love science and engineering, we love getting our hands dirty with hardware and software, and we love seeing our work make a difference in the real world.

We’ve created a diverse, collaborative, supportive, and fun environment based on integrity and treating people right. So no matter your sex, gender, sexual identity, gender identity, race, age, beliefs, sexual orientation, or disabilities, we welcome you and would like to work with you. :-)

It’s never boring, it’s always challenging, and we’re usually laughing.

A note of encouragement: If you don&#x27;t meet 100% of the qualifications on our open job descriptions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;InsightM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;InsightM</a>, you should still seriously consider applying.

Individuals with a disability are encouraged to contact [interview.accommodations@insightm.com] to request assistance with your application and accommodations in advance of your interview.
