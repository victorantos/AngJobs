<p>Freeform (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freeform.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://freeform.co/</a>) - Software Engineers (C++ / Rust) - Full-time - Onsite - Los Angeles, CA</p>

<p>Our team recently secured a key partnership with NVIDIA’s inception program and have been diving into advanced hardware acceleration, leveraging high-speed vision systems alongside modern GPUs and FPGAs to power up our autonomous metal 3D printing factories at a global scale.</p>

<p>It's a very exciting inflection point to get into the company at an early stage where we are at the cusp of securing multi-million-dollar annually recurring production opportunities with many of the top/largest aerospace, automotive, industrial and semiconductor companies.</p>

<p>We are hiring C++ and Rust Engineers who want to get their hands on cutting-edge robotics applications.</p>

<p>It’s a small, tight-knit team and you’d have the opportunity to own significant and impactful greenfield projects throughout the entire development lifecycle and much more.</p>

<p>Our software team comes from the likes of Google, SpaceX, and Apple, and believe in taking a first principles approach to solving hard problems.</p>
