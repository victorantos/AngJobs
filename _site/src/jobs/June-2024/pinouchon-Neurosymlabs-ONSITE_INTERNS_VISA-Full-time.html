<p>Neurosym labs - Zurich (maybe NY/Boston, maybe SF/Bay area) - ONSITE, INTERNS, VISA - Full-time</p>

<p>I am considering starting an AI/ML research company in the field of neurosymbolic programming (which sits at the intersection of deep learning, program synthesis and probabilistic programming). The goal is to be 100% focused on producing research that is made publicly available, guided by intellectual curiosity and a desire to move the field forward.</p>

<p>I am looking for co-founders or early employees. Although there is an existing company &amp; office that will be ready by the end of summer, not all details are figured out yet. The location is 80% likely to be Zurich (keeping the current office), but could be in the US. The funding is privately secured by other ML-related ventures I was involved with in the past. The name is also a placeholder name and will change. I can give more details privately.</p>

<p>Roles and compensation:</p>

<pre><code>  - Full-time employees: base of around 100-250k USD&#x2F;annum + equity with standard vesting (negotiable).
  - Interns or residency program: base of around 80-180k USD&#x2F;annum
</code></pre>
<p>(Other research interests: self-play, world models, common sense reasoning, program induction, causality, bayesian inference)</p>

<p>To apply, send me an email to b.crouzier at gmail and including "Neurosym labs application" in the title. Please reach out also if you just have pointers or other things you want to discuss, as I'm still exploring all options available.</p>
