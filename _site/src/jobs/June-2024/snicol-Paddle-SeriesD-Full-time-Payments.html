<p>Paddle - Series D - London/UK - Full-time - Remote/Hybrid - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paddle.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.paddle.com</a> - Payments</p>

<p>Paddle helps digital product companies worldwide to operate and grow, automatically with our all-in-one payments infrastructure.</p>

<p>Instead of assembling and maintaining a complex stack of payments-related apps and services, we’re a Merchant of Record for our customers. That means we take away 100% of the pain of payment fragmentation. It’s faster, safer, cheaper, and, above all, way better!</p>

<p>We currently have opportunities available in a couple of our teams for Go Engineers to join us:</p>

<p>Senior Go Software Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;paddle&#x2F;6d734b93-e7d9-41c3-922b-2e69a5d62b21">https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/paddle/6d734b93-e7d9-41c3-922b-2e69…</a></p>

<p>If you are passionate about building great products and enjoy working on high-scale, distributed systems in Go, then we’d love to hear from you! Please note, we can only consider UK based candidates for these positions.</p>
