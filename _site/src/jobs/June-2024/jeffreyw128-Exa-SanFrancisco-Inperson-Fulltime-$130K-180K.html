<p>Jeff, cofounder of Exa here. LLMs represent a brand new opportunity to organize humanity's knowledge, in a way that hasn't been done before. We're an AI research lab focused on AI-powered search algorithms (using embeddings), currently applied to vast swaths of the web (we make our money as a search API).</p>

<p>We're hiring pretty broadly across engineering - AI research, high performance Rust (e.g., we build an in-house vector DB), and full stack. If the mission of organizing the Internet motivates you, it's a good fit :)</p>
