<p>I am personally hoping we find a leader who values:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working software over documenting everything</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaborating day-to-day with product/curriculum over building quarterly spreadsheets with them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Responding to change over following a plan</p>
  </li>
</ul>
