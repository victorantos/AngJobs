Hi. I am Guillermo, backend developer of StreamingGuide. We try to make justwatch.com the best streaming guide worldwide.</p>

<p>We predominantly utilize Golang and Kubernetes, interfacing with GRPC APIs from teams such as Content (housing "the" database) and Martech (for ad display). Additionally, we work with databases like Scylla and Elasticsearch, ensuring seamless operation even under high loads exceeding 5k requests per second.</p>

<p>We're tackling challenges like integrating video ads, fortifying against scraping, enhancing response times, and optimizing the click-through rate for our recommender engine.</p>

<p>My colleagues from the content team, are also looking for a ML expert that help us finding the right recommendations.</p>
