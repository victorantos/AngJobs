<p>Canopy Connect - Backend Engineer - Carrier Integrations Team - Full-time - REMOTE (US &amp; Canada) - $100k–$150k+ - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usecanopy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.usecanopy.com/</a></p>

<p>We’re building “Plaid for insurance”—a single-click solution for insurance data sharing.</p>

<p>We serve over 4,000 companies (and growing rapidly!) including insurance agencies, lenders, insurtechs, fintechs, and insurance carriers to streamline acquiring verified insurance data from consumers and businesses.</p>

<p>We're hiring engineers for our Carrier Integrations team. We're a small, fully remote team based in the US and Canada. We present the best of both worlds - a nimble startup and small team (low strike price on equity and more ownership/impact), yet derisked because of our capital efficiency.</p>
