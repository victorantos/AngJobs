<p>HockeyStack - Backend Engineer - San Francisco, ONSITE, VISA</p>

<p>HockeyStack is creating a single source of truth and reporting for marketing, sales, and all customer data.</p>

<p>We came out of YC S23, and raised $4.3M from General Catalyst, Madrona, et al.</p>

<p>We grew from 0 to multi millions in annual revenue within a little over a year, profitably.</p>

<p>You will work on difficult problems in ingesting, storing, transforming, and reporting on billions of rows of data.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finding patterns in what closes a deal using machine learning</li>
  <li>Scaling the infra every other month to handle the load</li>
  <li>Creating a dynamic SQL engine that takes input from a couple of dropdowns to replicate all BI functionality that revenue teams want</li>
  <li>Maintaining reliability in tens of integrations that ingest full CRM databases and building new ones</li>
</ul>

<p>We have been doing this with a small but mighty team consisting of early startup engineers and founding CTOs (including one who founded a $900m company).</p>

<p>We have an intense culture â€“ we like to win, and win we do.</p>

<p>If you are exceptional at what you do, and you want to pour your heart out to build the largest enterprise software company in the world, please reach out at</p>
