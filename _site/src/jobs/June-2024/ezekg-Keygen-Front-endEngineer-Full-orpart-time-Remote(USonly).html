<p>Keygen - Front-end Engineer - Full- or part-time - Remote (US only) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keygen.sh" rel="nofollow">https://keygen.sh</a></p>

<p>Keygen is an open, source-available software licensing and distribution API built and run by myself. I'm a bit stretched thin in terms of front-end and support. I have a big front-end redesign code-named Portal on the roadmap that I haven't been able to make much progress on over the last couple years. I'm looking for somebody to help take that off my plate. You'd be the company's first hire, and would work directly with me, the founder. You'd be working out in the open, as the Portal app will be open sourced under an MIT license.</p>

<p>Looking for engineers that are familiar with TypeScript and React that can entirely own the app.</p>

<p>To apply, shoot an email to zeke@.</p>
