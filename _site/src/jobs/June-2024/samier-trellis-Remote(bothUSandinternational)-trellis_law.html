<p>About Trellis: Trellis is one of the only modern, searchable, and aggregated sources of state trial court filings around, and we are actively expanding to include Federal court dockets as well. If you have never before tried to search state court dockets, you probably aren't aware of how difficult it is to find what has been filed in public court cases. Trellis is filling the gap and modernizing the space. Our customers range from solo practitioners to some of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the country.</p>

<p>I am happy to answer any questions here, or via Discord DM (ss1515)</p>

<p>If your experience is on-point, I'd be happy to forward your CV to the hiring manager directly.</p>
