<p>We're creating cutting edge gesture detection algorithms for smartwatches.</p>

<p>Our goal is to solve the AR interaction problem, with our first product being an algorithm designed for smartwatch sensors which can detect subtle microgestures of a user's fingertip at an extremely high accuracy and robustness. This algorithm is so efficient that it removes an AR headset's reliance on camera-based hand tracking, making all-day lightweight headsets of science fiction finally a reality.</p>

<p>We also recently launched WowMouse[1], an app for smartwatches that lets you control devices like computers and tablets with your hand rather than a mouse (over Bluetooth).</p>
