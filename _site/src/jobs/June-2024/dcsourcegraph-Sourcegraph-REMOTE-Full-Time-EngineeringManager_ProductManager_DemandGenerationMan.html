<p>Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform that makes it easy to read, write, and fix code â€“ even in big, complex codebases.</p>

<p>We are building Cody, an AI coding assistant that uses code search and code intelligence to help devs quickly understand what's happening in code and generate new code that matches the best practices in your codebase. Cody supports AI-enabled autocompletion, fixing bugs, refactoring, test generation, code explanation, and answering high-level questions. You can read Steve Yegge's post on why Cody's code context engine differentiates it from the fast-moving field of AI dev tools: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cheating-is-all-you-need" rel="nofollow">https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cheating-is-all-you-need</a>.</p>
