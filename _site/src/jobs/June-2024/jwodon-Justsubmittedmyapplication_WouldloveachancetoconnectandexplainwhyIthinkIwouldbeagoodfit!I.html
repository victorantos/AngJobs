<p>Just submitted my application. Would love a chance to connect and explain why I think I would be a good fit! I am just wrapping up my Software Engineering bootcamp, but I know my technical skills will catch up to my soft skills very quickly. I am an experienced engineer who can communicate well and has experience working cross functionally. I know I would be a great fit for the team!</p>

<p>Thanks,
