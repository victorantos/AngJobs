<p>Felt - Community and Social Media Reps and Sales Engineers) - REMOTE (US timezones only) - Full Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felt.com" rel="nofollow">https://felt.com</a></p>

<p>Felt is the best way to make maps and work with geospatial data on the internet. It's surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. We are taking on an industry that's been stagnant for more than 30 years, but is essential to the workings of practically every company.</p>

<p>Felt is the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I'm an early Uber engineer.</p>

<p>First, we are looking for a Community and Social Media Rep. who will put our platform in the front the eyes of the right people, foster the right kind of community and be our voice online. The ideal person will have worked for a technical product and knows how to talk about it, have worked on launches (we do a lot! [2]]) and is comfortable in a start-up environment.</p>

<p>Second, we are looking for sales engineers who will help close the loop with our customers. We operate in a very technical field and our sales engineers will be bridging the gap between what our customers want and what our tools can do for them.</p>

<p>We are well-funded, and have been around. You can read more about it our funding here [3], and our announcement here [4]. Our terms are employee-friendly terms such as early exercise, a 10-year exercise window and even a matching 401(k).[5]</p>
