<p>LiveEO - Berlin, Germany - Hybrid or REMOTE in EU - Full-time</p>

<p>Hiring Manager here, we're building e2e applications using ML/AI and satellite imagery to identify deforestation in EU supply chains - and more.</p>

<p>First of all, apologies to those of you who haven't received a response yet. I was a bit overwhelmed by the number of sent applications. On the Data Scientist position: we are looking for someone who brings additional remote sensing/satellite imagery expertise into our team, sorry if I haven't followed up with you if you applied without this background.</p>

<p>We need people that know how to build efficient and performant ML pipelines for our data scientists (experience with any sort of computer vision data cubes beneficial, doesn't need to be satellite imagery) and for e2e production inference pipelines, engineers that implement complex supply chain business logic using nestjs, engineers that build wonderful user interfaces in react and data scientists that solve really hard problems in satellite imagery segmentation using deep learning:</p>
