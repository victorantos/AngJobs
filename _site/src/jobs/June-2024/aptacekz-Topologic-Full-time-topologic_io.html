<p>Topologic - Senior/Staff/Principal Frontend Engineer; multiple roles - On-site; remote - Full-time - Boston, MA, US; Paris, FR; remote - topologic.io</p>

<p>Over one third of apparel produced is never sold: Topologic’s mission is to eliminate this disastrous overproduction and waste by producing exactly to demand. To do this, we’re reinventing apparel manufacturing, from CAD/CAM software to novel intelligent machines. We are attacking a massive $2T industry, are already generating B2B revenue, and are backed with $10m from leading VCs and CAD insiders. We remain in relative stealth.</p>

<p>We are hiring passionate senior/staff/principal frontend software engineers, especially with interest and experience in design tools, computer graphics, and CAD, as well as web development. Our FE tech stack is TypeScript, React 18 (soon to be 19), Redux, and WebGL 2. We also use Rust via Web Assembly.</p>

<p>We are also hiring senior/staff/principal mechanical engineers as well as a machinist to work on our novel hardware projects. We build up deep domain knowledge about our industry and partners and have representative stakeholders in-house who we collaborate with on a daily basis.</p>

<p>We prioritize diversity and inclusion of all varieties. We appreciate our colleagues as unique individuals who all bring valuable perspectives to our work.</p>
