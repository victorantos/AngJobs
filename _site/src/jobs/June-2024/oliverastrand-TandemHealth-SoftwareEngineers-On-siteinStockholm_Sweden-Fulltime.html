<p>Tandem Health - Software Engineers - On-site in Stockholm, Sweden - Full time</p>

<p>The aging western population means we soon won’t be able to afford our current health care standards. Some 40% of the cost comes from administration. Much of this can be automated with LLMs + great software.</p>

<p>At Tandem we build products that allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, already at $300k ARR (+35% MoM). With our target set at the ginormous European healthcare market.</p>

<p>Why work at Tandem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Ship features that actually matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliver value to users right now, not in some promised future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Join a tight knit team on a mission to change European healthcare.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve recently raised a large seed round and are expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers!</p>
