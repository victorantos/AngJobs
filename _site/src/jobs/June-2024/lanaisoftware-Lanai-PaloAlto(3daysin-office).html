<p>We believe we are in the midst of a 4th industrial revolution and AI is changing everything. Like all revolutions, this one has tremendous promise and comes with quite a lot of chaos.  With a forecasted explosion of different AI applications to support enterprises, the question is: how do leaders unlock the potential of AI for their specific goals and how do people working in companies evolve together with the technology?  This is where Lanai comes in.</p>

<p>Lanai is built for large organizations looking to “Lean into AI” in a thoughtful way. Lanai will offer a software platform that helps companies adopt AI-based models and applications in a productive, cost-effective, and secure manner. Lanai’s co-founders are Lexi Reese (former COO of Gusto and VP of Google) and Steve Herrod (former CTO of VMware). Lanai has received substantive funding from top-tier VC firms and will release its first product later this year.</p>
