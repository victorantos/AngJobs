<p>Prophet Town - Full-Stack Engineer - REMOTE (USA-preferred) - Part-time or Full-time (20-40 hours/week) - $60-$110/hr - English fluency required</p>

<p>I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a small, fully-remote, sf-bay-area-based, boutique indie tech agency, with significant flexibility on hours, projects, and location.  Our leadership staff are all ex-Fortune100; everybody codes.  One-half 9-5 engineering; one-half freelancing: freedom, without solo practice risk.  Startup/entrepreneur mindset preferred.</p>

<p>Tech stacks and needs are diverse; our motto is “interesting work for interesting workers”.  Notable recent projects: auction.voltagepark.com, a slackbot for Anduril’s employees, app.pokercows.com.  Polyglot and many-hats preferred.  We are currently filling “Tier 3” ($60-70/hr, 5-10 y/o/e) and "Tier 4" ($90-$110, 7-20 y/o/e) roles, a little more focused on frontend (NextJS/React/Remix/React-Native), but backend (Node/Express/Go/Django/SQL) and cloud infra+devops (Kubernetes/Docker, AWS/GCP service set, common CI/CD options) also needed.</p>
