<p>Benikit - Co-Founding Engineer - NYC or Remote (USA only) - Equity</p>

<p>My name is Tyler, I'm the founder of Benikit.  Benikit is an early-stage startup dedicated to bringing tech into the outdated group insurance industry.  The mission is to help brokers stay ahead of the ever-changing landscape of group health insurance.</p>

<p>To move to the next step, Benikit needs to release V2 of the platform and secure funding while supporting the needs of its current clients. Things are moving fast and I am looking to hire an experienced engineer to help release the next version of the platform and play a key role in building out the engineering team as Benikit grows.</p>

<p>The ideal candidate is enthusiastic about getting involved at the start of a promising company and would share Benikit's vision for changing the landscape of an industry that is starving for tech.  They would have fullstack proficiency and be able to establish coding best practices while building new features for the platform.</p>

<p>Current Tech Stack: React / Node.js / Firebase</p>
