<p>NiftyKit - Senior Unity Developer - Remote - Full-time</p>

<p>We're a web3 NFT platform looking to hire a senior unity developer to work on exciting projects related to NFTs and gaming. Our team is based in Los Angeles, but we're a remote-first company.</p>

<p>We like to build and launch quickly and iterate fast as we collect feedback. If this resonates with you, we want to work with you.</p>

<p>Web3 experience is unnecessary, but be open-minded about what is currently possible. Bonus points if you love cars and have built racing games before.</p>

<p>Please send us your resume and project links, and tell us about your first car.</p>

<p>Email: tpae@niftykit.com</p>
