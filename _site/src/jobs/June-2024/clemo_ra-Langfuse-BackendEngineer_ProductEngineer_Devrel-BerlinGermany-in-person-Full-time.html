<p>Langfuse - Backend Engineer, Product Engineer, Devrel - Berlin Germany - in-person - Full-time</p>

<p>I'm Clemens, co-founder of Langfuse (YC W23) - we're building open source LLMOps dev tooling (Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;langfuse&#x2F;">https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/</a>). We started with observability and have branched out into more workflows over time (evals, prompt mgmt, playground, testingâ€¦). 
We have a bunch of traction and are looking for our third to fifth hire in scaling and building feature depth. We're hiring in person (4-5 days/week) in Berlin, Germany (salary ranges for each job 70k-130k, up to 0.75% equity).</p>

<p>If you'd love shipping in open source, writing about what you work on and working hard with super interesting and sophisticated customers (devs) - reach out!</p>

<p>We're particularly looking for a backend engineer that can help with Clickhouse and scaling our platform to serve thousands of companies and hundreds of millions of ingested events/day.</p>

<p>Feel free to ping me via clemens@</p>
