<p>Authentik Security - Engineer - US - REMOTE (anywhere) - Full-time</p>

<p>Authentik Security (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goauthentik.io" rel="nofollow">https://goauthentik.io</a>) is the company behind authentik (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;goauthentik&#x2F;authentik">https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik</a>), an open source identity provider with over 250k+ unique installations and 12M+ downloads. Help us replace Okta/Auth0, Ping Identity, and Microsoft Entra with modern, secure identity for all!</p>

<p>We are a small remote team, looking to scale up with a couple experienced software engineers, primarily with a backend focus. Bonus points if you have significant experience with identity/SSO standards and/or Django/Python.</p>

<p>There is also the opportunity to be "forward deployed" spending 15-20% of time with enterprise customers (remotely) on configuration best practices and rollout strategies, <em>if</em> that is of interest to the right candidate.</p>
