<p>Nooks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nooks.ai" rel="nofollow">https://nooks.ai</a>) - Software Engineers (full-stack &amp; backend/applied ML) - Full-time - Onsite in SF (hybrid)</p>

<p>Hi, I’m one of the founders of Nooks — we’re trying to re-invent how sales teams work with real-time collaboration and AI.</p>

<p>Nooks is: - A virtual office: you can work from anywhere in the world, but still work with your team and get feedback and coaching like you’re sitting side-by-side. - and an AI co-pilot. We learn how your team works, identify “winning” strategies and behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!</p>

<p>We’re working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms &amp; infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You'll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)</p>

<p>Right now we’re a small eng team (~12 ppl) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $4M ARR!</p>

<p>Looking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers. Excitement about language models, few-shot learning and other recent AI advances is also a plus :)</p>
