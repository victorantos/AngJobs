<p>Stanford University IT - Redwood City, CA - Full-time - Three positions - HYBRID</p>

<p>Stanford University IT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uit.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https://uit.stanford.edu</a>) provides a large number of IT-related services, from desktop support, to networking, to analog &amp; VoIP telephone, Kerberos, LDAP, AD, RADIUS, O365 &amp; Google &amp; Zoom, email, cloud, and more!</p>

<p>Within UIT, Middleware &amp; Integration Services (MaIS) runs the Registries.  Many central &amp; distributed IT systems are fed by the Registries, which take information from disparate sources, and combine them into single views of Organizations, People, Accounts, Courses, Groups, etc..  MaIS provides XML &amp; JSON APIs to interact with the Registries, as well as feeding information into LDAP.  They also implement business logic, mapping student and employee careers into account &amp; service lifetimes, group memberships, and more.</p>

<p>MaIS apps are almost exclusively Java (using Spring).  Tomcat and the Oracle Application Express (Apex) platforms are used as middlewares.  The database is, of course, Oracle (with PL/SQL).  Knowing any of the following would be a plus: HTML5, JQuery, shell scripting, and SnapLogic.</p>

<p>MaIS are looking for three people:</p>

<p>• IT Software Developer: You'll be working on existing Registry code, fixing bugs, and implementing enhancements.  More information: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD28zQlx" rel="nofollow">http://phxc1b.rfer.us/STANFORD28zQlx</a></p>

<p>• IT Software Developer (Oracle APEX): This is the same as the above position, but is focused more on our webapps than on our backend code.  More information: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDvMXQlz" rel="nofollow">http://phxc1b.rfer.us/STANFORDvMXQlz</a></p>

<p>• IT Systems Analyst: This is similar to the IT Software Developer, but you'll be spending more time talking with clients within the University, understanding their requirements, and coming up with solutions.
