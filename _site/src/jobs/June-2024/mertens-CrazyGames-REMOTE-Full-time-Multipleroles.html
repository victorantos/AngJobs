<p>With recent technologies such as WebGPU and WebAssembly, the browser is quickly becoming a powerful gaming platform. High-quality 3D graphics and near-native level performance are becoming possible without the need for downloads, apps, or platform-specific development. Our browser games platform is already reaching more than 35 million people per month. We are self-funded, profitable, remote-first, and fast-growing.</p>

<p>We are currently looking for multiple people on the product and engineering side to bring our product to the next level.</p>

<p>Please note that we're looking for people who can work on a European timezone.</p>
