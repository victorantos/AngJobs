<p>I help lead the Coinbase Developer Platform team (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdp.coinbase.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://cdp.coinbase.com/</a>).</p>

<p>Our goal is to build crypto developer tools that bring millions of developers and billions of users into crypto (today, crypto has &lt;50k active developers). If you're a developer, our job is to make it simple to build products, while providing the trust, scale, and usability that users depend on Coinbase on. Our teams work directly with our CEO (Brian Armstrong, YC S12).</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<pre><code>   - You have a passion for crypto (even if you&#x27;re new to the space)
   - You care deeply about developer experience (geeking out about things like SDK design)
   - We move at the pace of a startup, with value to full stack skillset, shipping fast, total ownership
