<p>We're an academic research lab focused on Exploring Earth's Virome, and identifying which viruses could be human disease-causing agents. We are building, Open Virome, an open-source platform to provide scientists with the ability to derive actionable insights from a massive DNA/RNA sequencing database, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The SRA houses billions of dollars of data from over 27 million datasets (~100 petabytes raw data) collected over 16 years. By querying, aggregating and displaying relationships between sequencing datasets (and meta-data) and the viruses they contain, we hope to illuminate the hidden universe of viruses all around us.</p>

<p>We're seeking a talented and innovative designer to assist the team with designing a user-friendly, intuitive, and visually compelling web interface for this research project and help further biomedical discovery. Looking for the right balance of design, data-scientist, and data visualization. Expertise in network analysis / virology is an asset. Send an email, introduce yourself, and please include your portfolio (examples of your previous work).</p>
