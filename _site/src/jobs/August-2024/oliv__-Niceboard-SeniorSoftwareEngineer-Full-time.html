<p>Niceboard - Senior Software Engineer - Full-time - Remote (US/Europe) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;niceboard.co" rel="nofollow">https://niceboard.co</a></p>

<p>Niceboard is a founder-led, profitable &amp; bootstrapped B2B SaaS startup. 
We are the preferred job board software for hundreds of organizations (associations/non-profits/staffing companies etc…) running white-label job boards. We've paid out over $2MM in job post earnings to our customers and helped thousands of candidates find jobs and hundreds of employers hire great talent.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a scrappy Full Stack Developer to lead product development &amp; help shape the evolution of our product and tech stack.
You’ll be joining a bootstrapped startup at a (relatively) early stage and reporting directly to me (the founder &amp; primary engineer/designer)
This is a no-nonsense, no-red tape, remote-ok position: this job is ideal for someone who likes to move fast and ship, and is looking for true product ownership and a direct impact on customers in a flexible work environment.</p>

<p>If you’re a “swiss army knife” engineer who wants to build a cool product helping connect people to jobs they love in a flexible, remote work environment, join Niceboard!</p>

<p>Tech stack: Hapi.js (Node), Vue.js, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch // I favor a minimal approach to tech, with ultra-simple, readable code and not too much tooling / bloat</p>
