<p>PlantingSpace - Full-time - Remote (EU time zone) with quarterly gatherings - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planting.space" rel="nofollow">https://planting.space</a></p>

<p>We are building an AI system based on a fundamentally new approach that goes beyond LLMs, aimed at providing novel capabilities. These include performing multi-step analysis, providing a verifiable reasoning path, citing sources, and assessing uncertainty. We envision applications supporting analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more.</p>

<p>We are continuously looking for strong new team members who are up for a challenge and a steep learning curve. On the Tech side, you’ll be exposed to cutting edge research in Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems, information theory, symbolic computing, and more. On the Business and Ops side, you’ll be part of building the foundations for a global tech company.</p>
