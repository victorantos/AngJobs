<p>Needle (Iterative S23) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.askneedle.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.askneedle.com</a> - Lead AI Engineer - FULLTIME - REMOTE (US) - West Coast US timezone</p>

<p>About Us</p>

<p>We're Needle. We help small e-commerce brands compete with fewer people and less money using our AI marketing assistant. Brand owners pilot our assistant which connects to everyday tools, crunches data, recommends smart growth ideas, and creates marketing content and campaigns. The result: they cover more marketing ground with less. Our brands grow on average by 53% over 5 months thanks to Needle's ideas. We just launched and already have 100+ brands using us with revenue, traction, and even closed our biggest subscription to date at $2k/month last week.</p>

<p>Why It’s Exciting</p>

<p>Join us at a thrilling stage - small enough to feel like a founding member of a startup, but with clear traction/revenue and about to raise more from investors. We're defining what “AI co-pilots” truly mean in marketing for small brands. This is a team that's helped brands grow for 20+ years and had several exits before. Not random founders. Not a random problem. Not randomly playing around with "gen ai." In fact, gen AI is only part of what we do.</p>

Key skills: AI/LLM models, generative technologies, React, and cloud platforms (GCP).
