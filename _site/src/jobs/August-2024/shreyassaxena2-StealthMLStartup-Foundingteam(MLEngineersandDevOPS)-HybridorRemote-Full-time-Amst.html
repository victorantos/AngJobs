<p>Stealth ML Startup - Founding team (ML Engineers and DevOPS)- Hybrid or Remote- Full-time- Amsterdam, Netherlands</p>

<p>We are building a lean generative AI stack, which would be tailored end-to-end (eg. embeddings, vector database, GPT model, etc.) for different enterprise use cases. The entire stack has dozens of hyper-parameters, which when configured automatically via ML, unlock &gt; 10x advantage over existing solutions. This is in contrast to existing status quo, where different companies (Cohere, OpenAI, Qdrant, etc.) are providing bloated foundational models/generic stacks for different parts of the stack.</p>

<p>Doing things end-to-end has always shown to be a much better approach (eg. Apple running efficient ML models on device), we would like to be the first to do it in the Generative AI space.</p>

<p>We are currently in the final stages of setting up the company and are figuring out the exact head-count and key people in the founding team. If you are passionate about: working on an interesting product, competing with folks from the valley (but from Europe), do reach out. We are looking for folks from ML research, ML engineering &amp; DevOps background. You can reach out on the email mentioned in the profile.</p>

<p>Why join us? deep desire to work on cutting-edge Generative AI tech, make significant impact as founding team, competitive compensation.</p>
