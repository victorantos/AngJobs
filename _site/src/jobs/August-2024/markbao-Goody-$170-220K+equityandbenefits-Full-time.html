<p>Goody - Remote within North/South America - $170-220K + equity and benefits - Full-time</p>

<p>Goody is hiring a Senior Software Engineer (Ruby, Rails, React) who moves at a startup pace, likes to ship fast, and is motivated by building delightful products.</p>

<p>I'm Mark, the technical co-founder and CTO at Goody. Despite being something everyone does, gifting is one of the areas of commerce yet to be disrupted. Our goal is to make people's days by making gifting easy, while building a sustainable business on that market opportunity.</p>

<p>We're looking for engineers who like to build at a startup pace, have a critical eye for detail and user experience, and thrive when given autonomy and ownership.</p>

<p>Our product is used by Google, Stripe, Meta, NBCUniversal, Notion, and others, and we also offer a developer API for commerce.</p>

<p>Take a look at our application (and a cool WebGL thing I built for it) at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ongoody.com&#x2F;swe" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.ongoody.com/swe</a> and feel free to email me at mark@ongoody.com.</p>
