<p>Kombo.dev (YC S22) - Berlin - Full-time - In-office (with flexibility)
We are a small (~19), fast-growing (3x YoY) team building a unified API for HR systems. Right now, we are struggling to keep up with customer demand (doubled from $1M to $2M ARR in the last 6-months) and desperately need to add more engineering power.</p>

<p>Thus, we are hiring multiple (product-minded) engineers and support/solution engineers of all experience levels. Jobs are here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;companies&#x2F;kombo" rel="nofollow">https://workatastartup.com/companies/kombo</a></p>

<p>Feel free to contact me at arne@kombo.dev - I'm the CTO and leading the hiring process</p>
