<p>Vectara (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectara.com" rel="nofollow">https://vectara.com</a>) - Field Engineer, Front-end Engineer, Platform  (back-end) Engineer, and Product Managers - Full-time - Egypt, Pakistan, and/or Remote (depends on position)</p>

<p>Vectara is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a service platform.  We have a ton of IP already: an embedding model that outperforms Cohere and OpenAI, a reranking model that does similarly, a generative model that outperforms GPT 4 for RAG, a prompt engine that can provide citations and markdown/HTML links in RAG use cases, a leading hallucination detection model, well as our own internal high-performance vector/hybrid database.  We just raised $25 million in series A and we're hiring a number of roles.</p>

<p>I personally lead product and before Vectara led product management teams at Kong and Elasticsearch at Elastic and am looking for a technically minded product manager with a few years experience in B2B.  Location is pretty flexible for the role, but I'd prefer someone in the US to help increase our timezone coverage for US-based deals and working with our many US (mostly west coast) colleagues.  I'm based in Berlin now after having been in SF for the past ~15 years.</p>

<p>All positions are at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vectara.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;#job-listings" rel="nofollow">https://vectara.com/careers/#job-listings</a>, but if you're a PM and interested in developer-focused GenAI, you can reach me at shane at [our domain, above]</p>
