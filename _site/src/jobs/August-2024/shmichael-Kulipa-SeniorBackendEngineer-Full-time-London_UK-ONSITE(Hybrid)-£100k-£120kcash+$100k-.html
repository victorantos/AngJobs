<p>Kulipa - Senior Backend Engineer - Full-time - London, UK - ONSITE (Hybrid) - £100k-£120k cash + $100k-$120k equity (~0.5%-0.6%)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Michael. CTO and co-founder of Kulipa. Previously I was an engineer and engineering manager at Google and Meta/WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Kulipa issues debit cards (Visa/MC) backed by crypto wallets instead of bank accounts.</p>

<p>We enable users in emerging markets to hold USD and EUR (via stablecoins) in self-custodial wallets, while seamlessly spending it in their local market. This is unlike any other "crypto" card today.</p>
