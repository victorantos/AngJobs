<p>Raylu is AI for financial services. Our product combines domain-trained and specialized financial LLM systems with a workflow, prompt, and knowledge base builder - giving funds accurate and cutting-edge AI that is deeply bespoke to their needs</p>

<p>Raylu’s engineering team of 5 people is looking to expand and hire an <em>AI Engineer</em>. We are looking for an engineer who is comfortable working with complex LLM systems, excel’s at experiment and evaluation driven development, and has a passion for solving hard open ended problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requirements *</li>
  <li>Experience with LLM systems. You are an expert in sophisticated RAG, chains and agentic systems (Langchain based), and fine-tuning.</li>
  <li>Experience working in a production python back-end. We build and manage our own systems and services, and therefore value scalability and reliability - we need an AI engineer who is a capable back-end engineer</li>
  <li>You have a ruthless work ethic and refuse to give up on excellence. A lot of this job is solving open-ended problems that require many failed experiments before a solution solves the problem - and we need engineers thick-skinned enough for that process.</li>
  <li>We often hit problems that genuinely require reading research papers in order to design new experiments to run. A formal background in ML is preferable, but are open minded to an AI engineer with a SWE background.</li>
  <li>You will be working with Raylu’s head of AI directly on a day-to-day basis.</li>
