<p>Riza, Inc. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riza.io" rel="nofollow">https://riza.io</a>) - SWEs and DevRel Engineers - Full-time or part-time - San Francisco or REMOTE</p>

<p>We use WASM to provide isolated runtimes for executing untrusted code, mostly generated by LLMs. Our customers do things like extract data from log lines at run time by asking claude-3-5-sonnet to generate a parsing function on-the-fly and then sending it to us for execution.</p>

<p>Things we need help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Our janky account management dashboard (Postgres / Go / React / TypeScript)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our hosted and self-hosted runtime service (Rust, WASM)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrations and demos with adjacent frameworks and tools (Python / JavaScript / TypeScript)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New products</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We have seed money, but the whole company is currently just me and Kyle working out of a converted warehouse on Alabama St. We’re second-time founders, so we know the risk we’re asking you to take and we’re prepared to compensate accordingly. Send an email to me at andrew at riza dot io or pop in our Discord (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;4P6PUeJFW5" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/4P6PUeJFW5</a>) and say hi.</p>
