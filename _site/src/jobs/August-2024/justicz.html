<p>Thank you HN/WaaS for helping us fill our last software role!! We're still hiring but for Mechanical Engineers.</p>

<p>Charge Robotics - Senior Mechanical Engineer - Full-time - Onsite - SF Bay Area</p>

<p>Hi HN! We’re a YC-backed startup building robots that build large-scale solar farms. We just got back from the first commercial deployment of our system on a real-world solar construction site.</p>

<p>Check out a video of our system here! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ZZ2fP1Y5Z2E" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/ZZ2fP1Y5Z2E</a></p>

<p>It turns out that construction companies literally can't build solar fast enough, so what we're doing is a crucial part of switching the grid over to renewable generation. We're looking to bring another talented mechanical engineer onto our small team.</p>

<p>You’ll be a key contributor, helping bring our next generation of mobile solar factory to life.</p>
