<p>AWS Device Farm - Senior level Software Engineer (L6) - Seattle, WA - Full Time</p>

<p>Device Farm manages thousands of real, physical devices in AWS data centers so that app developers can verify the quality of their apps on the same devices that their end users are using. From mobile phones and tablets, to desktop browsers, Device Farm makes it so that app developers can easily add end-to-end device testing to their CI/CD pipelines. We aim to enable our customer to have access to mobile compute resources in the same way that EC2 enables them to have access to generalized compute.</p>

<p>We are hiring one senior engineer to continue building out the capabilities and scalability of the service. You'll be tasked with acting as a dev-lead, mentoring several engineers on our team, and leading them towards completing large projects to advance the product for our customers. If you've previously built web services and APIs, and worked in end-to-end product teams from the customer to the hardware, you'll be successful with our team. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me directly (simsjon@amazon.com), and I'd be happy to explain more over a call or email (I've been with the team for 6+ years as an engineer).</p>
