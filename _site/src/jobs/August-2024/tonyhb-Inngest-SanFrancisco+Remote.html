<p>Inngest - San Francisco + Remote</p>

<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inngest.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.inngest.com</a> is a modern queueing/durable execution platform that allows all developers to ship fast, reliable code without managing infra, queues, or state.  Our users write step functions in their existing codebase, and we handle the backend infra, queueing, scaling, concurrency, throttling, rate limiting, batching, o11y, and tracing for you.</p>

<p>We're beginning the hiring process for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mid-Sr Frontend engineer:  responsible for building out our design system, real-time metrics, and o11y stack on our cloud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Infrastructure engineer:  an infrastructure engineer to help build and deploy our queueing system, state store, etc. on bare metal, then eventually our own hardware.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Jobs will soon go up on our website, but I want to get ahead of it in this thread.  HN has great talent!</p>
