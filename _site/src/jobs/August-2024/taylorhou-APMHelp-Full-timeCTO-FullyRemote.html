<p>APM Help - Full-time CTO - Fully Remote - www.apmhelp.com
America's largest residential rental operations platform</p>

<p>We currently help manage 300k+ SFR in 49 States with all things back office but primarily property accounting and compliance.</p>

<p>We're effectively bootstrapped, $6M+ ARR, cash flow positive, growing 20%+ y-o-y</p>

<p>We have a crack team of engineers led by a fantastic architect/eng manager but I'm still looking for the technical co-founder mentality to solve problems with weekend sprints/mvp's (build 0-1) and then hand off to a team to stabilize and scale.</p>

<p>Comp will be competitive with equity (if valued) - we usually give 3 options. cash no options, cash + options, little cash more options.</p>
