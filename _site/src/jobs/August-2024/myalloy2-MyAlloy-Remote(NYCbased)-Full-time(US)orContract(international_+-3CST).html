<p>Our small in-house development team builds and maintains a marketing site, customer portal, internal apps, backend systems to connect to our doctor portal, payment systems, and pharmacy fulfillment. You'll receive quite a lot of ownership, but we'll support you every step of the way.</p>

</ul>

<p>We run A/B tests using PostHog (ycombinator alum!) to scientifically update our marketing site and intake - optimizing for time through the flow, effectiveness, revenue, and operational efficiencies. You'll work with our CRO expert to create tests to optimize our funnel. We're looking for an organized data geek who can sling typescript! Once through our A/B test backlog you'll participate in full stack dev alongside the team.</p>

<p>Working with our head of QA, run and maintain our suite of Playwright tests.
