<p>Crusoe - Onsite/Hybrid â€“ San Francisco - Climate Tech, Cloud Compute, Distributed Systems, Crypto - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crusoe.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://crusoe.ai/</a></p>

<p>Crusoe is on a mission to align the future of computing with the future of the climate.</p>

<p>Data centers consume more than 2% of the world's electricity.  We power data centers with stranded energy such as gas flares  and underloaded renewables , so for every GPU hour you use on Crusoe Cloud, you're offsetting 0.5kg of CO2e, or approximately 4.4 metric tons over an entire year. The more compute you use, the more CO2 and other greenhouse gasses you offset.</p>

<p>Crusoe Cloud (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crusoe.ai&#x2F;cloud" rel="nofollow">https://crusoe.ai/cloud</a>) offers the cleanest and lowest-cost GPU cloud computing solution in the world for workloads including graphical rendering, artificial intelligence research, machine learning, computational biology, therapeutic drug discovery, simulation and more.</p>

<p>Here's a quick video so you can see what the systems look like in action, flames and everything: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rlt8k71Quqw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlt8k71Quqw</a></p>
