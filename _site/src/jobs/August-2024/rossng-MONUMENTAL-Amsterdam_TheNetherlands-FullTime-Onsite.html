<p>MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.monumental.co/</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite</p>

<p>We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, and we’re starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.</p>

<p>We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a neat software stack that lets us configure and control robots with ease. We’re deploying our robots on real construction sites and have started making the first revenue from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.</p>

<p>The software team is now seven people (~30 people overall), and continuing to grow. There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building, and we’re starting to scale up robot production to meet it.</p>

<p>Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.</p>
