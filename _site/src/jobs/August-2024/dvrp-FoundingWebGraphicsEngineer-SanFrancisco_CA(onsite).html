<p>KREA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krea.ai" rel="nofollow">https://krea.ai</a>) - Founding Web Graphics Engineer - San Francisco, CA (onsite)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Diego Rodriguez, Cofounder/CTO of KREA.</p>

<p>We are building tools to use AI creatively on the web (e.g. images, but also videos). Our team is 7 incl. founders. All of us are technical. We've been backed by world-class investors such as the cofounder of Facebook AI Research, Keith Adams; or, a founding member of OpenAI, Pamela Vagata. Happy to disclose more details over a call.</p>

<p>Requirements: we do not care too much about technology stacks 
in general and we don't think you should care (too much) about it either. In fact, a lot of what we've done is vanilla JavaScript / Svelte. Yet, experience with shaders, design, taste, and AI research &amp;&amp; â€“ engineering is heavily appreciated. Ideally, you would own all the UI/Graphics Engineering of the main product.</p>
