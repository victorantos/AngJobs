<p>Protege - Remote (US) - Full-time - Generalist Engineers and Senior / Staff Data Engineers - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withprotege.ai" rel="nofollow">https://withprotege.ai</a></p>

<p>Protege is looking to solve the biggest unmet need in AI — getting access to the right training data. The process today is time intensive, incredibly expensive, and often ends in failure. We’re building the Protege platform to facilitate the secure, efficient, and privacy-centric exchange of AI training data, starting in the healthcare industry.</p>

<p>We’re 4 months old, &lt;10 people, and well funded. We plan to grow to ~15 before the end of the year and are looking for exceptional engineers to build with.</p>
