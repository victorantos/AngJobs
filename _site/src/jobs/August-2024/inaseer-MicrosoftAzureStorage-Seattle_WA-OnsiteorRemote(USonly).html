<p>Microsoft Azure Storage - Seattle, WA - Onsite or Remote (US only)</p>

<p>Our team in Azure Storage is working on applying automated reasoning and validation techniques to scalably generate hundreds of thousands of tests to check data integrity and durability issues, and scalably validate a combinatorial number of feature interactions to catch regressions and subtle bugs that only happen under rare conditions. As a Software Engineer in this team, not only will you get an opportunity to use tools to specify and check the integrity, correctness and performance guarantees of a large and critical Azure service, you will also get an opportunity to work on building and improving the tools themselves as well as learn about existing state-of-the-art tools in this space. The lessons you will learn will be broadly applicable to any distributed system and will help accelerate your growth as a disciplined and thoughtful distributed systems engineer.</p>

<p>Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.</p>
