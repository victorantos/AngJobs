<p>Dirac - Software Engineer (£80k) + 0.5% equity - London, Acton - In-person</p>

<p>Run rate: £3.8m (july '24) up from £1.05m *jul '23)
Backed by patio11 &amp; backedvc, we're an exporting startup, offering a chance to write code (django/postgres/python), learn to drive a forklift (Hyster J2.0UTT) and wire up label printers (brother-ql 1100c + a new zebra one which I bricked using Chat GPT sending commands directly through).</p>

<p>Experience as a forklift driver or as a software engineer not essential.</p>

<p>The role would ideally start in October, but we can be flexible (forecasting labour demand on an exponential curve is non-trivial)</p>

<p>Email me ethan@dirac.software if interested.</p>
