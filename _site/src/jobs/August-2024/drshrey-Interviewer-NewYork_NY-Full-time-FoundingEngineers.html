<p>Interviewer - New York, NY - Full-time - Founding Engineers - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getinterviewer.com" rel="nofollow">https://getinterviewer.com</a></p>

<p>Interviewer automates first-round screening interviews with an AI voice agent. We're well-funded, deployed with multiple customers and are already hitting non-trivial scaling challenges.</p>

<p>We're looking for founding engineers who have strong intuitions on implementing strong reliability, low-latency systems as well as realtime observability systems to go along with it. ML experience is a plus but the focus is on full-stack software engineering right now.</p>

<p>We pay above market, have all the healthcare benefits you could want and are in-person at our office in lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>Send an email to shreyas@techinterviewer.ai (me, the CTO) if you're interested!</p>
