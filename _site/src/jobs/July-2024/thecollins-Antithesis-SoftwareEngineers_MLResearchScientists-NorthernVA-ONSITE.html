<p>Antithesis - Software Engineers, ML Research Scientists - Northern VA - ONSITE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antithesis.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://antithesis.com/</a></p>

<p>Antithesis is using deterministic simulation, fuzzing, and novel ML techniques to improve software testing and increase developer velocity. For an idea of what we're doing, see Will's talk here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fFSPwJFXVlw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFSPwJFXVlw</a> or read the Simulation Testing section of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foundationdb.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;fdb-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf</a>. Fully funded medical, dental, and vision insurance. Unlimited vacation (with mandatory MINIMUM vacation time). Flexible hours. Incredible, cohesive team with the hardest and most interesting problems to solve.</p>

<p>We're doing things nobody has done before, so we don't need familiarity with any particular language, framework, domain, or anything like that. Don't care. What we do care about: you're smart, get things done, a joy to work with, and are comfortable dealing with open-ended problems.</p>

<p>Apply at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antithesis.breezy.hr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://antithesis.breezy.hr/</a> (Don't worry too much about which role you choose. We're looking for engineers who are ready to learn, not those that know everything already!)</p>

<p>We're also hiring for professional services roles. Feel free to ask about those.</p>
