<p>Learnwise.ai - Junior-Mid AI/ML/Backend Engineer (fulltime) + Junior-Mid QA engineer (part-time) - REMOTE (EU timezone if freelance contract OR Spain/NL for employee contract) - 2-4k/month</p>

<p>We build an LLM-based conversational assistant deeply integrated in the Edtech ecosystem. Aim to relieve teachers and admin workers of tedious "easy" questions so they can focus on important cases. Moving towards knowledge management and course support.</p>

<p>Early startup, small, tightly knit team (5 engineers, 2 implementation/process-focused folks, 1 sales guy, 1 marketing gal, 1 chill product-centered CEO). We're slowly scaling and expanding.</p>

<p>Stack (not crucial but you should at least be proficient in python):</p>

<ul>
  <li>FastAPI python backend</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Langchain for the AI aspects, slowly moving away from it</li>
  <li>Next.js (react) frontend</li>
  <li>AWS</li>
</ul>

<p>We have two open roles. Common requirements: excellent spoken English, a generalist/"get things done" mentality (we're a small startup), and sufficient drive/curiosity to figure things out (and build them/fix them) on your own - we don't micromanage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Junior/mid AI/backend engineer: you'd start off supporting me with developing the AI aspects of the product - for now, mainly the conversational interface. This isn't a purely ML position; for now lots of the work is SWE/back-end dev. Projects on the roadmap: migrating away from Langchain, building robust testing and observability for LLM performance, experimenting with and improving the RAG pipeline, fine-tuning/distillation where relevant to reduce latency/costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience requirements: ~masters level education in relevant field (doesn't have to be a masters/formal education, but you need to convince us you have an equivalent level of experience/understanding) &amp; 1y of full-time relevant work experience (can be as student job)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Junior/mid QA engineer (part time, can be negotiated). Two main aspects to this:
    <ol>
      <li>Improve and expand our back-end tests; in particular, add E2E and integration tests</li>
      <li>Manual QA as part of our release cycle, which you will then slowly automate with browser automation tools (selenium).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Experience requirements: ~bachelor level in relevant field &amp; 1y+ of relevant QA experience OR ~3-4 years of highly relevant work experience.</p>
