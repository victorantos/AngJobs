<p>Hypertune (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hypertune.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.hypertune.com</a>) - ONSITE (London) - Senior Product Engineer</p>

<p>We're building the most flexible and developer-friendly platform for feature flags, A/B testing, analytics and app configuration. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.hypertune.com" rel="nofollow">https://docs.hypertune.com</a> for more details.</p>

<p>At the core of Hypertune is a visual, functional, statically-typed programming language with first-class citizens for analytics, A/B testing and machine learning loops.</p>

<p>Our UI lets users define their configuration logic in this language and our SDKs act as interpreters, evaluating the logic locally with zero network latency.</p>

<p>As a senior product engineer, you'll work mainly in TypeScript and React.</p>
