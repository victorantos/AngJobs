<p>HockeyStack - Cracked Backend/Infra Engineer - ONSITE (San Francisco) - VISA sponsorship available - $180k-$250k + 0.2-0.4% stock option</p>

<p>HockeyStack is creating a single source of truth and reporting for marketing, sales, and all customer data.</p>

<p>We came out of YC S23, and raised $4.3M from General Catalyst, Madrona, et al.</p>

<p>We went from 0 to millions in ARR in a really short time and are in a DEEPLY URGENT need of really good engineers to help scale infra and backend.</p>

<p>The product collects data from CRM, marketing automation, ad platforms and data warehouses. The data then gets cleaned and transformed into a unified format. Out of the unified data format, customers can create any type of report the want using the UI. We have a dynamic query engine that transforms UI inputs into a query.</p>

<p>Because of the flexibility and how much data we process, keeping integrations up, transforming data accurately, reporting accurately and performantly is a huge technical challenge.</p>

<p>Please email me at bugra @ hockeystack.com if you want to take a crack at some of these problems.</p>

<p>Worth noting that we are fully in-person in a beautiful office near Oracle Park in SF!</p>
