<p>Standard Model Biomedicine - Founding Engineering Roles</p>

<p>We are building the standard model for biomedicine. This is the hardest and most important problem in life science. We are solving it.</p>

<p>One of the following (founders are filling both roles currently):</p>

<p>AI: you are 5x faster than anyone you know at implementing, training, fine-tuning sota. e.g. you can write an ACL accepted paper in 1 week from concept to arxiv.  Given a choice between openai and working with us, you would choose us.</p>

<p>Data science: you are 3x faster and 10x better than anyone you know at deciding what to evaluate, how to evaluate it, and how to communicate it. You are comfortable learning biomedical jargon and humble but confident about testing that with any biomedical expert in the world. Given a choice between leading analytics at the top ranked medical institution in a given field and us, you would choose us.</p>
