<p>Bruinen - bruinen.co - (Senior) Software Eng - in-person / remote San Francisco</p>

<p>Bruinen is working on infrastructure technology for edge environments - we're starting with the database. Our database, Delta, is local-first and distributed. Each device (AV, robot, drone, sensor) can continue working without connectivity, and merge it's changes (conflict free) whenever it comes back online.</p>

<p>We target use-cases in the harshest environments - where connectivity is expected to drop: battlefields, at sea, in the air, and in the wilderness.</p>

<p>We're written completely in rust (though its not a requirement for this position, come learn!).</p>

<p>If interested, email me at tevon at bruinen dot co</p>
