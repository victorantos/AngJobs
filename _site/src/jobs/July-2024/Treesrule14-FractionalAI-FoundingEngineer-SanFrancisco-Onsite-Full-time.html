<p>Fractional AI - Founding Engineer - San Francisco - Onsite - Full-time</p>

<p>Who: We're Fractional AI â€“ the dev shop for difficult enterprise applications of genAI.</p>

<p>Looking for: You! Full-stack founding engineers (5+ years of experience, 150k-210k cash, meaningful equity, 99% healthcare premium coverage )</p>

<p>How: apply <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;fractional" rel="nofollow">https://jobs.lever.co/fractional</a> or reach out to me (ben@ fractional.ai)</p>

<p>Why we may be a great fit:</p>

<p>-High impact AI projects - we work on companies' hardest problems to get genAI into production (in the same quarter you might build an AI phone agent for one customer and automate a complex workflow for another customer)</p>

<p>-Culture of a startup but substantive problems to solve that impact millions of users</p>

<ul>
  <li>Curious, humble, banter-y in-person team comprised of multi-time founders</li>
</ul>

<p>Why we may not be the best fit:</p>

<p>-Excellence isn't really really important to you (this is less of a 'move fast and break things' role, though we respect that ethos!)</p>

<p>-Predictability is important to you - we work across customers, tech stacks, industries etc</p>

<p>-Interacting with customers isn't your thing</p>
