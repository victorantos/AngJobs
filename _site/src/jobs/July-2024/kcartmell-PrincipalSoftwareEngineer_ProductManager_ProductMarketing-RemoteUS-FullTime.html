<p>Principal Software Engineer -</p>

<p>You will be working on our core wellness product, launched late-2022. Work includes the addition of new wellness plan features and capabilities, enhancement of user experience, testing and operation of the wellness platform, and special projects that arise from time to time. We frequently work cross-functionally and you can expect to write code and perform technical operations for our marketing, sales, and support efforts, as well.</p>

<p>Our tech stack includes Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Tailwind. We use both JavaScript and TypeScript heavily.</p>

<p>To apply for the engineering role, please email kyle@snoutplans.com.</p>

<p>Our typical process is a one hour technical interview followed by a casual 30 minute meeting with our whole team.</p>

<p>We're a small startup team consisting of fewer than ten people. Successful team members are comfortable participating in spirited and detailed debates to establish product and technical plans, and then taking initiative and ownership to deliver on those plans quickly and effectively. Our team is collaborative. You can expect to meet with the team on a daily basis, pair regularly, and participate in slack discussions throughout the day. We keep pacific work hours and expect the team to be available during 9a-5p at a minimum. If you're looking for a team where you can carve out your area of responsibility, work with experienced partners who have your back, grow your role alongside the growth of the company, and take a product to the moon, then we should talk.</p>
