<p>Fondant - Generative 3D workflows - AI/ML Engineer (diffusion models) - Full time, REMOTE</p>

<p>We are hiring for diffusion model experts at Fondant. You will be a great fit if you can implement, customize and deploy SOTA open-source research in image, 3D and video diffusion models. Experience with finetuning and pretraining would be a huge plus.</p>

<p>Reach out at my username [at] fondant.design with a short blurb about yourself and link(s) to personal contribution(s) e.g., open-source code, cool demo of something you built etc.</p>

<p>Fondant is on a mission to make 3D more accessible. We are building a tool that harnesses the latest advancements in generative AI/ML to make new 3D workflows for modeling and rendering. Traditional 3D tools are often unapproachable (think Blender, 3DS Max). We are leveraging the lessons learnt from computer graphics + SOTA work on 3D reconstruction, NeRFs, gaussian splatting and image generation.</p>

<p>We have an early product + users + funding.</p>
