<p>Trunk is an a16z funded dev tools startup, redefining software development at scale. We aim to solve problems that developers hate by bringing the tools usually built in-house at the best engineering orgs to every development team. We've built three products so far and have plans for more:</p>

<pre><code>  * Trunk Check: a universal linter&#x2F;formatter, available as a CLI, VSCode extension, and CI check;
  * Trunk Merge: a merge queue, to ensure that PRs are tested in order before they&#x27;re merged; and
  * Trunk Test Analytics: detects, quarantines, and eliminates flaky tests from your code base. Prevents flakey tests from producing noise and blocking CI.
</code></pre>
<p>In 2022, we raised a $25M Series A led by Initialized Capital (Garry Tan) and a16z (Peter Levine).</p>

<p>Our tech stack:</p>

<pre><code>  * Frontend: Typescript, React, Redux, Next.js
  * Backend: Typescript, Node, AWS, CDK, k8s, gRPC
  * Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Kiali, Jaeger
  * CLI: C++20, Bazel
  * VSCode Extension: Typescript
  * CI&#x2F;CD: GitHub Actions
  * General: GitHub, Slack, Linear, Slite
