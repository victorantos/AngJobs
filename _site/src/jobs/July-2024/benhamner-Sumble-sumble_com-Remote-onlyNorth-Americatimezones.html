<p>Sumble's applying language models (both small and large) to build high-quality datasets. Near-term our focus is company-related data that we integrate with customer's Salesforce data to make go-to-market operations more efficient. Long-term we want to become the first place you go to find high-quality data that lives outside your organization.</p>

<p>Currently a team of 7 engineers, including Kaggle/Google/Primer/Stack Overflow/Meta alumni.</p>

<p>Our tech stack includes Python, FastAPI, React/Typescript, GCP (postgres + alloydb + cloud run), regular expressions, and Pytorch/Gemma/Mistral.</p>

<p>Challenges we face include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Transforming noisy datasets + noisy models into high quality data products</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Making expensive analytics computations run efficiently</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Managing the complexity of an increasing number of data sources, models, and operations on top of these</p>
  </li>
</ul>
