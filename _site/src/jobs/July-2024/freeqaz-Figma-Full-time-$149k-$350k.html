<p>Figma - Senior/Staff Security Engineer - Remote (US / Canada), or in-office SF/NYC - Full-time - $149k - $350k</p>

<p>The security team at Figma spans a bunch of areas (AppSec, Infra, AI/ML, etc). I am currently working on securing our recently announced AI features â€“ how do you deal with model security? Especially when some of those models include private data? Not a lot of prior art here, so it's an interesting learning experience!</p>

<p>We're really just looking for smart people that want to find problems to chip at. The company is growing fast and there is no shortage of interesting work. (I wrapped up my YC startup to join the team!)</p>

<p>Generic job req is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;figma&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4214880004" rel="nofollow">https://boards.greenhouse.io/figma/jobs/4214880004</a></p>
