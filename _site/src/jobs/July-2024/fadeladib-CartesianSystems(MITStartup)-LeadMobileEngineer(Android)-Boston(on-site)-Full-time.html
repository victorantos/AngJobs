<p>Cartesian Systems (MIT Startup) - Lead Mobile Engineer (Android) - Boston (on-site) - Full-time</p>

<p>Iâ€™m the CEO of Cartesian Systems, a seed-stage MIT startup on a mission to map the physical world at unprecedented scale and precision. We're looking for a lead mobile engineer to complement and amplify our core team at Cartesian, as we transition our product to scale.</p>

<p>Here's some info about us and the role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cartesian spun out of my lab at MIT in 2023 after 7 years of award-winning research/IP development in indoor mapping &amp; localization. Since then, we have built our first product, deployed it with early customers, and are cashflow-positive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Joining Cartesian now is a unique opportunity to lead a core component of our product as we transition to scale and to help shape the product roadmap and company culture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You'll lead the end-to-end design, development, and deployment of our native Android application, mentor other engineers, implement novel features like real-time user feedback and AR guidance, and collaborate on shipping stable and performant enterprise products.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our current app is native Android and written mostly in Kotlin. The core pages include location tracking, BT and camera sensor data, and live updating maps.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
