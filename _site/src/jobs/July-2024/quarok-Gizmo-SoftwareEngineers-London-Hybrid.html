<p>Gizmo is a startup on a mission to make learning so easy and fun that anyone can learn anything. We're aiming to help 1 billion people learn by building Duolingo for Anything - a fun gamified way of learning anything!</p>

<p>Weâ€™re an early stage well-funded startup that's grown 11X in the last year. We're run by a former Google marketer &amp; Amazon machine learning researcher, a former teacher, and a database specialist who became best friends while studying at Cambridge University. You'd be one of our first hires and an incredibly important part of the team.</p>
