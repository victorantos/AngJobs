<p>Shmood is a VC backed company on a mission to eliminate design alignment churn.</p>

<p>We’re building Pinterest for design enterprises — to allow designers and their teams instantly align with clients of any background, on a project of any scale. To do this, we’re integrating a semantic data layer that takes multimodal design intent and communicates it, refines it, and turns it into actionable advice.</p>
