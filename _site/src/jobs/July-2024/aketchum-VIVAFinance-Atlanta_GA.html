<p>VIVA Finance - Atlanta, GA - Junior/Senior Back-End and React Developers, Project Manager</p>

<p>VIVA is a Fintech Startup based in Atlanta, GA with the mission to build a more inclusive financial system. VIVA offers unsecured personal loans to subprime customers who have traditionally been excluded and taken advantage of by the legacy financial institutions. The VIVA difference is to underwrite heavily on employment history and set up repayments through voluntary direct deposit payments from the borrower paycheck.</p>

<p>We are a VC backed company and have been in business for 5 years. We hit cash-flow positive in May and are now default alive with our ongoing growth series B likely to be our final round. We are growing the team to further support our personal lending product, in addition to getting the staff to support building new products to diversify our revenue streams.</p>

<p>Our tech stack for the back-end is fully on AWS, using Lambda and ECS for compute and Typescript as the language, but experience with this specific stack is not necessary for talented candidates. Preference is given to candidates who can come 4 days a week to our new office on the Atlanta Beltline (next to Krog Street Market) but remote positions are available for strong candidates able to work hours in eastern timezone.</p>
