<p>VALIS Insights - Full-time - REMOTE (US)</p>

<p>I'm the co-founder and CTO of VALIS, a B2B SaaS company delivering software solutions to the metals recycling industry. Our goal is to reduce global carbon emissions through maximizing the recovery of metals through recycling, which requires a fraction of the energy compared to mining and primary metals production. We're a seed-stage startup, backed by leading climate-tech VC's.</p>

<p>Product-wise, we integrate recycling processes, equipment/sensors, production, and procurement/sales data to deliver an insights platform that helps metals recovery facilities optimize their processes. We employ a strong, domain-driven design approach to building our product. We're looking for execution-focused engineers to join our team and deliver complex features with autonomy.</p>

<p>We're currently hiring for two roles:</p>
