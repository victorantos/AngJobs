<p>Loop is on a mission to unlock profits trapped in the supply chain (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loop.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;unlock-profit-trapped-in-your-supply-chain" rel="nofollow">https://loop.com/article/unlock-profit-trapped-in-your-suppl…</a>) and lower costs for consumers. Bad data and inefficient workflows create friction that limits working capital and raises costs for every supply chain stakeholder.</p>

<p>Loop’s modern audit and pay platform uses our domain-driven AI to harness the complexity of supply chain data and documentation. We improve transportation spend visibility so companies can control their costs and power profit. That is why industry leaders like J.P. Morgan Chase, Great Dane, Emerge, and Loadsmart work with Loop.</p>
