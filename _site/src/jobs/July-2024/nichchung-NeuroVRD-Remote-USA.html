<p>NeuroVRD - Remote - FTE/PT - USA</p>

<p>NeuroVRD is developing an intraoperative monitoring platform that automatically and continuously monitors the functional integrity of neurovascular structures that are at surgical risk during high-risk surgery, improving surgical outcomes and maintaining the patient's quality of life.</p>

<p>Our transformative approach to intraoperative monitoring increases access and availability, improves reliability, and significantly reduces costs.</p>

<p>In the last few years, we've developed a real time automated signal processing platform, and are working with world-class surgeons at Hopkins and Columbia towards clinical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our platform.</p>

<p>We are looking for an ML/AI Scientist/Engineer to lead our signal and gesture classification efforts. Our interview process is short and to-the-point â€“ no take-home projects, etc. Let your prior work speak for itself. We're looking to hire someone who can start ASAP.</p>

<p>To get started, please email jmeo@neurovrd.com</p>
