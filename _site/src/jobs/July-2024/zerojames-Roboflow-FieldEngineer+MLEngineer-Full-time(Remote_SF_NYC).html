<p>Roboflow - Field Engineer + ML Engineer - Full-time (Remote, SF, NYC) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;careers?ref=whoishiring0724">https://roboflow.com/careers?ref=whoishiring0724</a></p>

<p>Roboflow is the fastest way to use computer vision in production. We help developers give their software the sense of sight. Our end-to-end platform<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring0724&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring0724&lt;/a">1</a> provides tooling for image collection, annotation, dataset exploration and curation, training, and deployment.</p>

<p>Over 250k engineers (including engineers from 2/3 Fortune 100 companies) build with Roboflow. We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;universe?ref=whoishiring0724&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;universe?ref=whoishiring0724&lt;/a">2</a>. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;autodistill&#x2F;autodistill&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;autodistill&#x2F;autodistill&lt;/a">3</a> and Supervision<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roboflow&#x2F;supervision&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roboflow&#x2F;supervision&lt;/a">4</a>. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring0724&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring0724&lt;/a">5</a> and YouTube channel<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Roboflow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Roboflow&lt;/a">6</a>.</p>

<p>We have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy &amp; we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can "choose their own loss function". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders &amp; problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)</p>

<p>We're currently hiring full-stack engineers for our ML and web platform teams, a web developer to bridge our product and marketing teams, several technical roles on the sales &amp; field engineering teams, and our first applied machine learning researcher to help push forward the state of the art in computer vision.</p>
