<pre><code>  CAPP is a leading industrial distributor. Our team is looking for an additional hire to work on a myriad of pricing and data tasks. We are currently sprinting the processing of manufacturer and vendor product data and pricing, in order to expand our eCommerce offerings and enable all of our product lines to be offered for sale digitally. We have built out tools that use Python and other libraries to help automate data inflow and processing. We run a legacy ERP platform and are in the midst of a major migration to a new platform with powerful eCommerce capability slated for the late summer. Over time, there is tons of opportunity for advancement and growth based on merit. If you are interested in working for a stable company with a startup-like technology team where your changes directly impact business growth and customer satisfaction, we&#x27;d like to hear from you.
