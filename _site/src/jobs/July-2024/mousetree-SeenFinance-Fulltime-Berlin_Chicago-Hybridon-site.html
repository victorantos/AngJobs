<p>Seen Finance - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seen.com" rel="nofollow">https://seen.com</a> - Full time - Berlin, Chicago - Hybrid on-site</p>

<p>At Seen, we believe that everyone deserves a fair opportunity to (re)build their credit. We understand how tough it can be to qualify for a credit card when your credit score isn't where you want it to be.</p>

<p>Seen is a new fintech company, started in 2023 following the acquisition of Sable (YC S19) by Snap Finance. We've recently launched a credit card in the US for people with less than ideal credit. We plan to offer other novel credit products in the future.</p>

<p>It's a great time to join as the team is small (15 engineers) and we're growing fast. We're a startup but we're also lucky to have the financial support and customer base from our parent company.</p>

<p>We're hiring for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Senior and Staff Software Engineers (Berlin)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senior and Staff Data Engineers (Chicago)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our mobile app, web app, and backends are written in Typescript. Our data stack uses Python and SQL.</p>

<p>If you're interested, just email us your resume or LinkedIn page: join-berlin@seen.com (for both Berlin and Chicago roles)</p>
