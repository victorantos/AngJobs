<p>Instant - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instantdb.com">https://instantdb.com</a> - Software Engineer - SF (ONSITE) - Full Time - 150-210K + Equity</p>

<p>Do you like SICP? Are you interested in Clojure? Do you geek out about real-time infrastructure (like Figma's LiveGraph or Asana's Luna)? We want to talk you.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>We're building Instant - a modern Firebase. Instant gives you a database you can subscribe to directly in the browser. You write relational queries in the shape of the data you want and we handle all the data fetching, permission checking, and offline caching. When you write transactions, optimistic updates and rollbacks are handled for you as well. [1]</p>

<p>We went open source [2] in August, and had one of the biggest Show HN launches for a YC company [3]. We're backed by James Tamplin, the founder of Firebase, Paul Graham, Greg Brockman, Jeff Dean, and a slew of other angels.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-we-looking-for">Who are we looking for?</h2>

<p>First and foremost, we want to work with people who we will be friends with for a life time. We love high-integrity, optimistic, and principle-oriented people. Taking inspiration from Facebook, Airbnb, and YCombinator we deeply resonate with these three core values</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Move fast</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be a host</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make something people want</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is the hacker mentality we strive for — building quickly, being kind to each other, and honing in on delivering value. There’s a lot of opportunity to contribute to Instant’s architecture. If real-time infra sounds cool to you, we’d love to talk!</p>
