<p>Notion’s looking for an android engineer to join our Mobile Product pod and help us build more high-quality, mobile-first experiences. Notion’s Android app began as a shell that ran the web app in a webview that we’ve increasingly ported to Kotlin and Compose. This greatly improved app performance[1] and has unlocked the potential for more delightful mobile UX. Help us make this a reality!</p>
