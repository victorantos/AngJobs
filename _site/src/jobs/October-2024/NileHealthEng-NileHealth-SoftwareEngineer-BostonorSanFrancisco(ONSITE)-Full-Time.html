<p>Nile Health - Software Engineer - Boston or San Francisco (ONSITE) - Full-Time</p>

<p>We’re building a service to help consumers navigate healthcare more easily. It’s the kind of tool that I wish already existed — a way to quickly chat with a highly-qualified doctor about a health problem, figure out the right next steps, and then get care virtually or in-person (including highly accurate estimated upfront prices).</p>

<p>We have an experienced team that has built a successful company in this space before. After raising a seed round from top-tier investors just over a year ago, we launched a first version of our service in several states. Customer feedback has been enthusiastic (NPS hovering above 80) and unit economics look good, so we are working to scale the service and make it available nationwide by early 2025. You won’t find much about us online yet, but we’ll share our story more publicly soon.</p>

<p>We're looking for engineers who are excited about building a seamless and beautiful consumer healthcare product. We care deeply about technical excellence but also move quickly. We don’t expect you to have a healthcare background (though it’s great if you do!), but you should be excited by the prospect of digging into the messy complexities of the American healthcare system (navigating price transparency data from payers, integrating with EHRs, medical billing, provider credentialing, etc).</p>

<p>If that sounds exciting to you, email me at noah@nile.health</p>
