<p>EthonAI - Senior DevOps Engineer - ONSITE/HYBRID - Zurich, Switzerland - Full-time
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethon.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://ethon.ai/</a></p>

<p>We are a fast-growing AI startup with the goal of revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. We recently achieved a series A led by Index Ventures. Our software products are used by Fortune 500 companies and industry leaders across Europe and the US, such as Siemens, Lindt and Roche.</p>

<p>We're after a Senior DevOps/Cloud/Infrastructure Engineer to take ownership of our software infrastructure and deployments. This position is ideal for a mid-career professional who is enthusiastic about complex software products, eager to grow their impact, and driven to build leadership skills in the trenches.</p>

<p>Buzzwords: AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Postgres, Python, Timescale, CI/CD</p>

<p>(Please note: We typically don't sponsor visas except in exceptional circumstances)</p>

<p>My take: We're a small but high performing team, complete with ex-FAANGers and ETH PHDs. You'll be helping me build out Platform Engineering with K8s as a greenfield project, along with supporting the companies current deployments. There's the typical fast startup pace but our founders take WLB/employee health very seriously.</p>
