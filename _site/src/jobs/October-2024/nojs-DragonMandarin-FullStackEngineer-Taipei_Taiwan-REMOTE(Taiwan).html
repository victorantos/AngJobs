<p>Dragon Mandarin - Full Stack Engineer - Taipei, Taiwan - REMOTE (Taiwan) - &gt;= 80k+ NTD</p>

<p>We're building an app that rewrites arbitrary Chinese text into simpler language, helping users learn Chinese by reading interesting content.</p>

<p>You will be our first hire working directly with me, the founder. Youâ€™d be working very independently, with approximately weekly in-person meetings in Taipei.</p>

<p>NTD 80k+/month depending on experience. Must be reasonably fluent in Chinese.</p>

<p>Apply if you are interested in the intersection of Chinese language learning and AI. Current stack is Django + React (experience beneficial but not essential if you learn fast).</p>
