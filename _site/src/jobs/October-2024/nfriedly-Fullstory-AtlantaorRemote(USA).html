<p>One SRE role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Senior Platform Engineer - $175,000 - $190,000 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;891442d3-955a-452a-b557-e7a521ac196a?ashby_jid=891442d3-955a-452a-b557-e7a521ac196a&amp;utm_source=092xpqyAkV" rel="nofollow">https://www.fullstory.com/careers/jobs/891442d3-955a-452a-b5…</a></li>
</ul>

<p>…and a few other roles in sales, customer support,  etc. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstory.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;?utm_source=092xpqyAkV" rel="nofollow">https://www.fullstory.com/careers/?utm_source=092xpqyAkV</a> for the full list and some general info.</p>

<p>For the mobile roles, we're not building apps. Experience with that is helpful, but we're really looking for someone who's interested in reverse engineering and diving into the depths of mobile applications, frameworks, and operating systems to understand how they work.</p>

<p>I added pay ranges for the ones I know. I can also say that as a Staff Software Engineer on the mobile team, I make a bit over $200k base, in addition to bonus and equity. All the usual benefits: healthcare, 401k matching (Vanguard), unlimited PTO (I take about 5 weeks a year), etc. You also get a sabbatical after 5 years of employment.</p>

<p>Feel free to reply here or email nathan@[company site] if you have any questions. (To apply, please submit your info on the website.)</p>
