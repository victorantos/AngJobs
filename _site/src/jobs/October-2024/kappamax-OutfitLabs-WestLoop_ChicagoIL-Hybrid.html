<p>Outfit Labs - West Loop, Chicago IL - Hybrid - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outfitlabs.com" rel="nofollow">https://outfitlabs.com</a> - Frontend/Backend/ML</p>

<p>We're a venture-backed startup in Chicago exploring how AI can transform people's experiences.</p>

<p>Although we’re still pre-market, we’re building products to help people see themselves in the world around them. We believe the following:</p>

<pre><code>  * That humans are unique and deserve to be heard and listened to
  * That where folks choose to go - or stay, or eat, or work, or play, you get the idea - ought to be a reflection of who they are as a person
  * That new advancements in technology can make our collective experiences more human and personal, not less
</code></pre>
<p>If you share any of our beliefs - or our love for people, maps, recommendations, and listening - then we’d love to talk to you!</p>

<p>Our tech stack:</p>

<pre><code>  - Frontend: Typescript, React, Next, Tailwind
  - Backend: Kotlin, Springboot, AWS
  - AI layer: 15 foundation models, langchain
  - CI&#x2F;CD: Github actions&#x2F;Vercel
