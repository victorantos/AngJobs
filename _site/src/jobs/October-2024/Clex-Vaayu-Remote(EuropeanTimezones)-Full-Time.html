<p>Vaayu - Remote (European Timezones) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaayu.tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.vaayu.tech/</a></p>

<p>At Vaayu, we're on a mission to fight climate change by helping e-commerce retailers measure and reduce their carbon emissions. E-commerce has a significant climate impact, and calculating carbon manually can be time-consuming and costly. Our goal is to make carbon analytics accessible to every online retailer, empowering them to take control of their environmental footprint.</p>

<p>Our automated software is already trusted by sustainability leaders such as Klarna, Wunderman Thompson, Vinted, Ace &amp; Tate, Adevinta or New Balance, linking up with shop platforms to deliver the tools necessary for retailers to take charge of their environmental footprint.</p>

<p>We are a distributed company based in Berlin, with an international and diverse team throughout Europe.</p>

<p>We are looking for a mid-level Golang engineer to join our team. Experience working with large existing codebases is a plus.</p>

<p>If you’re an innovator and want to work in a purpose-driven startup, we’d love to hear from you! To apply, email me at clem [at] vaayu [dot] tech, please mention HN in the subject.</p>
