<p>Dirac - Junior/Senior Software Engineer (£60k-£95k) + 0.3-0.6% equity - London, Acton - In-person</p>

<p>Backed by patio11 &amp; backedvc, we're an exporting startup, offering a chance to write code (django/postgres/python), learn to drive a forklift (Hyster J2.0UTT) and wire up label printers (brother-ql 1100c + a new zebra one which I bricked using Chat GPT sending commands directly through).</p>

<p>Experience as a forklift driver not essential. You should feel excited by writing and designing code which will analyze cash flows, optimise pricing, improve shipment monitoring.</p>

<p>The role would ideally start in November, but we can be flexible (forecasting labour demand on an exponential curve is non-trivial)</p>

<p>Email me ethan@dirac.software if interested.</p>
