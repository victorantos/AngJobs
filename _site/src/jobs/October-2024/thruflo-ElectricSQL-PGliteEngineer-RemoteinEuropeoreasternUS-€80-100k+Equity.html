<p>ElectricSQL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com" rel="nofollow">https://electric-sql.com</a> - PGlite Engineer - Remote in Europe or eastern US - â‚¬80-100k + Equity</p>

<p>We're looking for a generalist web and systems engineer to join the core PGlite team, working mainly in Typescript, Rust and C++.</p>

<p>PGlite (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pglite.dev" rel="nofollow">https://pglite.dev</a>) is a lightweight, embeddable WASM Postgres. It's a fast growing open source project, with 8k GitHub stars and 100k+ weekly downloads. It opens up new possibilities for local-first apps and systems built on an embedded, real-time, reactive Postgres, such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgres.new" rel="nofollow">https://postgres.new</a></p>

<p>Technically, you need strong Typescript and systems programming experience, ideally in C++ and Rust. It would be great if (but is not essential that) you're familiar with some aspects of database internals, filesystems and WASM.</p>

<p>We're a highly technical team working remote-first on a 4-day week. More information at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electric-sql.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;pglite-engineer" rel="nofollow">https://electric-sql.com/about/jobs/pglite-engineer</a></p>
