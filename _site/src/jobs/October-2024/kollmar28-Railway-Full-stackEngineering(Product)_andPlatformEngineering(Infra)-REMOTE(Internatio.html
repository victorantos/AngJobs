<p>Railway - Full-stack Engineering (Product), and Platform Engineering (Infra) - REMOTE (International) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;Railway?utm_source=DayMzWzJ0P">https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Railway?utm_source=DayMzWzJ0P</a></p>

<p>Tired of trying to beat kube into shape? Does writing YAML to ship code fill you with utter dread? Dream of a future where deploying software is simple, and you don't need an army of infrastructure engineers to build that perfect janky bash script™ to make life easy?</p>

<p>We're Railway, and we think infrastructure can be better. So far we've built out a platform loved by hundreds of thousands of users who simply tell us "Give me Postgres", "Deploy this repo", and we make it happen</p>

<p>Fair warning! The problems are complex: home-rolled hypervisors, cut-above container orchestration, over/under/whateverlay networks, virtio device drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn't suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build it and we're looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun.</p>

<p>Two open roles (apply below!):</p>
