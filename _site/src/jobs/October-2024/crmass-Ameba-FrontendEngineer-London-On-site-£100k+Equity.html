<p>Join us in building Ameba, an AI Supply Chain platform. If solving the hardest problems of your career excites you, read on!</p>

<p>If you’ve never considered working in supply chains before, everything around you, including the device you're reading this on, has a story of how it got there. From raw materials to the final product in your hands, that story is its supply chain. If you’re excited by this hidden complexity that powers the global economy and influences so much of your day-to-day life, we’d love to talk.</p>

<p>We're a seed startup made up of experienced entrepreneurs (who have previously raised $160m+) and builders (formerly at Google, Microsoft, Snap, Facebook &amp; Palantir). We have big ambitions and are backed by the best investors in Europe, having raised over $9m since our launch just over a year ago.</p>
