<p>We're building the worldâ€™s most ambitious ab-initio, in-silico material discovery platform. Our goal is to reimagine the way material scientists conduct experiments, by speeding up the idea-simulation-result loop for small molecule chemistry and materials science.</p>

<p>We're looking for a Senior Infrastructure Engineer that brings expertise in Kubernetes and Python. We need help with automating our K8s setup, implementing Helm packaging, and building CI/CD pipelines.</p>

<p>While initially there's a lot of DevOps in the role, there's room to grow into a combination of DevOps and Distributed Systems Programming. This role would suit someone who is excited to transition into some coding.</p>

<p>Even if you don't check every box, we encourage you to apply!</p>

<p>Keywords: Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, Python (Django)</p>
