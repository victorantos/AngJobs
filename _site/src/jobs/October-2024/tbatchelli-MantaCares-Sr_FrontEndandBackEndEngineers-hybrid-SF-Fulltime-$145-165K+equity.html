<p>Manta Cares - Sr. Front End and Back End Engineers - hybrid-SF - Full time - $145-165K + equity</p>

<p>At Manta Cares, we're on a bold journey to demystify healthcare and transform the healthcare experience for patients and their loved ones. Our mission is much bigger than any one of us â€“ we're here to make a real difference in people's lives.</p>

<p>Venture backed (pear.vc, Sozo, 1843 ventures). Come to bootstrap our SF engineering team. We are looking for senior people who like go get their product in the hands of users and also want to contribute to making people's life better when they need it the most.</p>

<p>We are looking for Sr. BE and FE engineers to join the Head of Engineering (me!) in San Francisco (hybrid, 2 office days a week). Because you'd be one of the first US-based engineers, you'll need strong Golang + Postgres or Typescript + React skills, or convince us that you can get there fast. It also helps if you have worked in healthcare environments and / or if you have a passion to help people of all walks of life go through their hardest times. We deal with non-ordinary problems and constraints, bringing simplicity and calmness into very complex and stressful situations.</p>
