<p>TalkJS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkjs.com" rel="nofollow">https://talkjs.com</a>) - REMOTE (Europe / Middle East / Africa)</p>

<p>TalkJS lets developers build a perfect chat feature in just a few minutes. We power communication in online marketplaces, community sites, multiplayer apps, trading platforms and so on. We're product driven and we care tremendously about quality.</p>

<p>We're headquartered in the Netherlands (Eindhoven) and our team is spread across the Central European Timezone +/- 3h.</p>

<p>We're particularly looking for:</p>

<pre><code>    * Mobile SDK Developer (iOS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;React Native&#x2F;Flutter)
    * Full-stack Developer (TypeScript&#x2F;Elixir&#x2F;Postgres)
</code></pre>
<p>If you enjoy crafting perfect libraries and APIs for other programmers to use, get in touch!</p>

<p>TalkJS touches millions of people and is growing quickly. We want to be the tool that every developer thinks of for building communication features, a bit like what Stripe is for payments. 80% of the company is product people, founders are a designer and a programmer.</p>

<p>Our strategy is to give great engineers a maximum amount of freedom, so they can ship fantastic SDKs, APIs and features. This means a lot of responsibility, a lot of agency, a sane work/life balance, no meetings, no red tape. We're growing, profitable, and not dependent on venture funding. Sound good?</p>
