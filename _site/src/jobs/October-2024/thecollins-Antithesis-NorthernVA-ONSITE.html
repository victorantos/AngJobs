<p>Antithesis is using deterministic simulation, fuzzing, and novel ML techniques to improve software testing and increase developer velocity. See Will's talk (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fFSPwJFXVlw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFSPwJFXVlw</a>) for the ideas that underpin our approach or read the Simulation Testing section of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foundationdb.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;fdb-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf</a>. We have a growing base of customers and great community buy-in. Fully funded medical, dental, and vision insurance. Unlimited vacation (with mandatory MINIMUM vacation time). Flexible hours. Incredible, cohesive team with the hardest and most interesting problems to solve.</p>

<p>We're doing things nobody has done before, so we don't need familiarity with any particular language, framework, domain, or anything like that. Don't care. What we do care about: you're smart, get things done, a joy to work with, and are comfortable dealing with open-ended problems. Check out our blog for an examples of what we recently launched, e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antithesis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;multiverse_debugging&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://antithesis.com/blog/multiverse_debugging/</a></p>
