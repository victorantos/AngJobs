<p>krea - core technical staff member - full-time in-person in san francisco, ca</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(some) tools we use: duckdb, postgresql, tigris (globally replicated s3), kubernetes, svelte(kit), pytorch (nightly builds), redis, multi-cloud stuff, figma, vercel (in weird ways)…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some tools we are <em>likely</em> to use (ordered by likelihood): bun, flydragon, jax, &amp; clickhouse, and maybe some basic stuff (e.g. queues, mails, etc.) from vendors who'll try to lock us in (likely cloud providers).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>the current "role needs" are around web/networking/UI/databases/product. so, we will prioritize people interested/leaning towards those tasks/technologies – but, if what you read below is enticing, please reach out either way.</p>

<p>we are biased of course, so take this with a grain of salt: our team is excellent. we are lacking a bit in terms of AI research talent, but we're quickly ramping up on that side (there are many candidates in the pipeline from excellent AI research institutions). our team is comprised of folks who started companies before, built software downloaded millions of times, did research at institutions like MIT, Microsoft Research, or earned one of the most prestigious scholarships of their country awarded by the head of state (the last statement holds true for 2 members of the team; they both dropped out to start krea). still, we are still learning every day and we make embarrassing mistakes like any other human; we believe in asymptotically reaching perfection through constant iteration.</p>

<h1 id="funding">funding</h1>

<p>Q: VC-backed?
A: yes, by folks like the founder of Meta AI (fka Facebook AI Research), founding member of OpenAI, or AI fund from Google.</p>
