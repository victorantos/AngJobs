<p>RunReveal - Hacker Herald - Remote (US) - Full-time</p>

<p>At RunReveal, we're building a Security Data Platform that helps ensure no breach goes undetected.  We're doing that by first building a data pipeline for security that normalizes and enriches events coming from SaaS tools then routes it into ClickHouse or object storage for archival.</p>

<p>In this role, we're looking for someone that might not exist.  We're looking for someone who loves following threat intel feeds and the latest breach reports only to try and see if they can replicate the attack vectors, document them and share how to defend against them.</p>

<p>This role is part researcher, part marketer, part defender, and whole hacker.</p>

<p>We're looking for someone who's excited to help companies defend against the changing threat landscape by using the most cutting edge SIEM available today, ours.  Experience with machine learning is a plus.  Writing experience required and speaking at events is a big plus.  And above all, a hacker mindset is your most important asset.</p>
