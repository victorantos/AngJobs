<p>Our mission is to make authentication and authorization simple and secure for every developer building web and mobile applications. We want devs to stop worrying about auth and focus on building something awesome.</p>

<p>There are a lot of companies in this space, but we feel like we have something special:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a unique deployment model (self-host or run in our cloud)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>API first from the ground up</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a relatively mature product (the code base is over eight years old and we've found and fixed a lot of the sharp edges around core login use cases, but there are plenty more features to write)</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
