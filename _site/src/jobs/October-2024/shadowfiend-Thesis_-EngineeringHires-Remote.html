<p>Thesis* - Engineering Hires - Remote</p>

<p>Thesis is a cryptocurrency venture studio whose mission is to empower the individual—we seek, fund, and build products using cryptocurrency and decentralized technology that further this mission. Current and past Thesis projects include Fold (2014), tBTC (2020), Taho (2021), Etcher (2023), Embody (2023), and Thesis Defense (2024). Investors in the company include Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and Draper Associates, among others. We are a remote-first company, led by founders who have been operating in the cryptocurrency and web3 space for a decade (actually for a decade ;)).</p>

<p>Our current focus is on building Acre, a Bitcoin-in Bitcoin-out BTC staking platform, and Mezo, an Economic Layer for Bitcoin. Across the board, we are focused on building a new home for Bitcoin holders to cultivate Bitcoin and grow wealth together. Our projects are built with an emphasis on creating something useful with a clear value proposition rather than a perfect technical machine that provides unclear value.</p>

<p>We’re a fun, down-to-earth, fast-paced and highly collaborative team looking to expand our engineering (Go, Solidity, and TypeScript) and product capabilities (amongst other disciplines) and this is where you come in. Join a team that strives for excellence and help us build technology that enables the integrity and empowerment of the individual.</p>
