<p>EdgeDB - SREs / Infrastructure Engineers - Full-time - Fully remote - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edgedb.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.edgedb.com/</a></p>

<p>EdgeDB is an open-source database built on top of Postgres. Itâ€™s designed to give developers a better end-to-end user experience than traditional SQL databases. We provide a more expressive schema modeling &amp; query language (EdgeQL), and "batteries included" features such as built-in schema migrations and a graphical schema browser, data explorer, and access control/auth.</p>

<p>We offer a hosted cloud service for EdgeDB, with the goal of doing developer-friendly cloud hosting "the right way" - we want users to use our hosted service because it's great, not because they're locked-in by restrictive licensing or cloud-only features.</p>

<p>We are looking for experienced SREs / infrastructure / devops engineers to help scale out our cloud. Unlike many infrastructure roles, this is not supporting a separate product team - for us, our infrastructure is our product. We are looking for people who care about not just building reliable infrastructure but also exposing that infrastructure to end-users as a seamless product.</p>

<p>Our tech stack is Hashicorp tools (Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault); Postgres; Golang with some Python &amp; Rust; and AWS (with eventual expansion to other cloud platforms)</p>

<p>We are a remote-first company, headquartered in San Francisco, with most of the team working in US/Canada timezones and a few people in Europe. Unfortunately we are unable to provide any visa/immigration sponsorship at this time.</p>
