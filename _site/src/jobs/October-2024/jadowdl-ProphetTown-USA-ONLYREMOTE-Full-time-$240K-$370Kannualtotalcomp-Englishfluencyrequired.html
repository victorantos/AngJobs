<p>Prophet Town - Full-Stack Engineer + PM + DevOps/Infra - USA-ONLY REMOTE - Full-time - $240K-$370K annual total comp - English fluency required</p>

<p>I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a small, fully-remote, sf-bay-area-based, boutique indie tech agency. Our leadership staff are all ex-Fortune 100; everybody codes.  Notable recent projects: voltagepark.com and a slackbot for Anduril’s employees.</p>

<p>Unlike earlier HN Who's Hiring posts, we have specific existing clients in mind: total comp is not flexible hourly, but full-time salary with client-tied equity compensation.  We are currently filling “Tier 3” (5-10 y/o/e, $240K-$320K annual comp) and "Tier 4" (7-20 y/o/e, $300K-$370K annual total comp) roles:</p>

<pre><code>    Engineers: Full stack polyglot but JS&#x2F;TS heavy (SQL&#x2F;NextJS&#x2F;Node&#x2F;React&#x2F;Remix), AWS deployments.  

    Infra+Devops: Kubernetes&#x2F;Docker, Terraform, AWS service set, common CI&#x2F;CD options.

    PMs: JIRA&#x2F;Trello, stakeholder wrangling, proof of winning engineer trust and surviving big-org politics.
</code></pre>
<p>We’re a worker-first operation.  Applicants must meet a high bar; in return, I pledge my personal commitment to finding you interesting work and getting you good pay.</p>

<p>Contact James: hn-hiring@ptown.tech.  We are a small shop and can get swamped; nonetheless if you send us something by Friday Oct 4, you will hear something by Saturday Oct 5.  Please make sure to include a resume in pdf format, and clarify which of the three positions you are interested in.</p>
