<p>Sticky AI Game Maker - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getstic.ky" rel="nofollow">https://getstic.ky</a> - Head of Marketing, Cofounder/COO, others - REMOTE</p>

<p>Sticky is a mobile gaming platform with an AI Game Maker at its center with which non-technical users can create a simple game in &lt;5min with no code, publish to friends/other users, and soon will also be able to monetize. We're aiming to make creating &amp; publishing a game as easy and fun/social as publishing a video on YouTube or TikTok. Check out the app on iOS (web version out in a few days, Android still pending): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;pt&#x2F;app&#x2F;ai-game-maker-sticky&#x2F;id1497044357" rel="nofollow">https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/ai-game-maker-sticky/id1497044…</a></p>

<p>Founded by successful 2nd time entrepreneurs, we are backed by Canary, a leading Latam VC. We are currently a small team (founder/CEO, 4 devs, 1 designer, 1 analyst), and we're looking for people who are excited by the mission and by the idea of joining an early stage startup. We have multiple positions open. I'm currently based in São Paulo, Brazil for family reasons, but positions are remote.</p>

<p>Top priority:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Head of Marketing. Requires strong experience in performance marketing including all the mess that is mobile attribution and/or in more organic content and community driven marketing for B2C digital products such as apps, games. Also looking for analysts/individual contributors in each of these fronts (performance, influencers, etc.).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generalist/Co-founder/COO. Sharing management responsibility with me (CEO) as needed more generally - recruiting, managing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We are also looking to complement our product and tech capabilities if we find the right person, so:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Product Lead. Ideally combines strong design sense with business sense and analytics, with previous experience in B2C mobile (apps or games). Working with our designer who is first-class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tech lead. Hands on, given the small team. Our current backend is mostly Node.js with TypeScript. Our current devs are good (mix of senior and junior) but all individual contributors.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you like the product (give it a try) and the mission, would love to hear from you!
Please email CV + short note to talent@getstic.ky</p>

<p>Cheers,
Alan Lammiman</p>
