<p>Happy Scribe - Senior/Staff Engineers - Hybrid (Barcelona, Spain) - Full-time</p>

<p>Hi there, Happy Scribe founder here. At Happy Scribe we think audio &amp; video should be universally accessible. Today’s state of the art is agencies doing everything manually. We want to scale high-quality subtitles &amp; dubbing with a multi-player editing experience that combines sota ai with a global marketplace of proofreaders. Being product-led we have the datasets needed to get there. It’s the Tesla autopilot play in the language service industry. If we succeed we’ll live in a world where everyone can consume any content in their native language without degrading the experience.</p>

<p>A team of 5 engineers and 0$ vc money built the product, used by +350k/mo people with high 7-digit revenue. We inhabit a beautiful 4-story designer office in the Gràcia neighbourhood.</p>
