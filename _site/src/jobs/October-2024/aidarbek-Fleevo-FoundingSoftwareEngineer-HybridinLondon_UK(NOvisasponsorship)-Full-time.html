<p>Fleevo - Founding Software Engineer - Hybrid in London, UK (NO visa sponsorship) - Full-time</p>

<p>Commercial fleets power the most essential operations in the physical world: trucks delivering food to our tables, vans repairing water pipes or installing power lines, construction equipment building our critical infrastructure, and much more. Fleets have a profound impact on our day-to-day lives, but they have historically been underserved by the tech industry.</p>

<p>Fleevo is changing that</p>

<p>We are transforming data into decisions for commercial fleets. Fleevo helps fleets to improve vehicle uptime, drive revenue, cut costs, optimise workflows, and operate more sustainably.</p>

<p>We are looking for our first engineering hire outside of founding team, more details about the company, role, and the application process: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fleevo.notion.site&#x2F;Founding-Software-Engineer-Fleevo-79f0ef833d5246e6b722b8eee58ba1c8" rel="nofollow">https://fleevo.notion.site/Founding-Software-Engineer-Fleevoâ€¦</a></p>
