<p>Sourcetable - Full-Stack (Python/React, Staff) - San Francisco - Full-Time</p>

<p>Sourcetable is building an AI spreadsheet &amp; data platform.</p>

<p>We came out of stealth via ShowHN last two weeks ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41590682">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41590682</a></p>

<p>5 of 8 on the team are ex-founders and 4 of us have previously founded an AI or ML company. Everybody is technical. We're looking for a staff level eng to join our team in SF. Previous founding-team experience strongly preferred (but not required).</p>
