<p>Accretional - Founding Software Engineer - San Francisco, ONSITE - Full-Time - $100k-200k + 1-2+% equity</p>

<p>Come work with us on Brilliant, the most capable agentic AI code editor to date. We're putting the finishing touches on it - join us and help us ship!</p>

<p>We're looking for someone with frontend / fullstack skills, with at least 3 and preferably 5 or more years of experience. It would be beneficial to have additional experience with any of the following: IDE and IDE extension development, cloud development environments, platform engineering, AWS/GCP/K8s/containers, devops, WASM, "prompt engineering", and of course LLM usage and development. Skill with wielding AI dev tools as a user would be a very big plus.</p>

<p>We're located in Jackson Square in San Francisco, and this role would be on-site four days per week. We cannot sponsor visas at this time, and you should either be in the SF Bay Area already or able to relocate here by the end of January.</p>

<p>About Accretional - I [0] left Google in March to better integrate LLMs into developers' workflows. I though most products and startups in the space were either being way too ambitious with what they were claiming to build, or building things that weren't adding much more value than just integrating a chat interface. I still think that. Brilliant is our first product, and we have more to come. I'm the founder, we have one full time employee, and a couple part time employees. You'll have the opportunity to join us very early on with all the excitement and hat wearing that entails!</p>

<p>Contact: jobs at accretional dot com [1]. Please add a brief description of how you currently use AI dev tools.</p>

<p>[1] You might notice if you visit our website that it kind of sucks. That's why we need someone like you with frontend skills! Brilliant itself is in a better shape, but we really need a frontend expert to help us make it something our users will love.</p>
