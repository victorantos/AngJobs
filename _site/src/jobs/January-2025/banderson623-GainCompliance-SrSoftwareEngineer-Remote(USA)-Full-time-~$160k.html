<p>Gain Compliance - Sr Software Engineer - Remote (USA) - Full-time - ~$160k - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.gaincompliance.com" rel="nofollow">https://join.gaincompliance.com</a></p>

<p>Hey this is Brian from Gain Compliance, we've had success hiring out of a hacker news thread before, so let's give it a spin again.</p>

<p>We are a small company that builds financial reporting tools for the insurance industry. While the domain might be foreign to most, we are having a lot of fun building modern web software with React, Python and Node running on GCP infrastructure. You'll be joining 7 other engineers split into two full stack product focused teams.</p>

<p>We've been around over 8 years and value empowering our customers to breeze through their boring compliance tasks, building great teams that focus on outcomes over features, and work place stability.</p>

<p>We wrote a lot more over at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.gaincompliance.com" rel="nofollow">https://join.gaincompliance.com</a> if you are interested.</p>
