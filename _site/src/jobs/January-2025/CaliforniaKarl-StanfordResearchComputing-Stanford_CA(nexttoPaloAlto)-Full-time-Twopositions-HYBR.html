<p>Stanford Research Computing - Stanford, CA (next to Palo Alto) - Full-time - Two positions - HYBRID</p>

<p>Stanford Research Computing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https://srcc.stanford.edu</a>) is a collaboration between University IT and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. We operate HPC environments for researchers, we do one-time consultations on projects (from software and pipelines, to data management, to physical building design and fit-out), and we provide contract support for individual Labs, Departments, and Schools.</p>

<p>We have two open positions:</p>

<p>• GPU Cluster Sysadmin: We are working on the go-live for Marlowe—our 1SU NVIDIA DGX H100 SuperPOD with DDN Intelliflash and DDN NFS storage—and have decided to hire an additional sysadmin!  You'll be working with the latest AI/ML/Deep Learning/LLM software &amp; frameworks, getting them to work in an HPC environment.  You'll be keeping the environment up-to-date, and working with NVIDIA/DDN when there's trouble.  You should also expect to interact with users &amp; PIs a lot.  More info: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORD8mESql" rel="nofollow">http://phxc1b.rfer.us/STANFORD8mESql</a> (or, if you're very experienced in the field, go to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;phxc1b.rfer.us&#x2F;STANFORDrWNSqm" rel="nofollow">http://phxc1b.rfer.us/STANFORDrWNSqm</a>).</p>

<p>• Research Computing Manager: Our current IC:Manager ratio is 7, which is too high, so we're hiring another manager for our group! You'll oversee a number of ICs, help them plan &amp; prioritize their work, make policy decisions, and contribute to Research Computing's strategic direction. You'll also be interacting with groups throughout the University, as a service provider and as a policy maker.

<p>If you don't already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you drive, you will have to pay for parking for the days you're on-site. There is some on-call around the holidays. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation). All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards</a>.
