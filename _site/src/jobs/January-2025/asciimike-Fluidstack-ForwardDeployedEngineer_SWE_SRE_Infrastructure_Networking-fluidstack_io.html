<p>Fluidstack - Forward Deployed Engineer, SWE, SRE, Infrastructure, Networking - London/SF/NYC or remote - fluidstack.io</p>

<p>Fluidstack builds and operates GPU supercomputers for top AI labs, governments, and enterprises. Our customers include Mistral, Poolside, Black Forest Labs, Meta, and more.</p>

<p>Engineers at Fluidstack work on a wide variety of activities, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Deploying clusters of 1,000+ GPUs and operating them with and for customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Validating correctness and performance of underlying compute, storage, and networking infrastructure, and working with providers to optimize these subsystems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrating petabytes of data from public cloud platforms to local storage, as quickly and cost effectively as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debugging issues anywhere in the stack, from “this server’s fan is blocked by a plastic bag” to “optimizing S3 dataloaders from buckets in different regions”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building internal tooling to decrease deployment time and increase cluster reliability, including automation where the customer benefits clearly outweigh the implementation overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We don't require prior experience with GPUs or AI/ML; we require a willingness to learn quickly, work hard, and obsess about customer success.</p>
