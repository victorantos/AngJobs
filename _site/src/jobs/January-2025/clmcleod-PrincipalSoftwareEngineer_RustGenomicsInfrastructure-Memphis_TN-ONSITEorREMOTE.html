<p>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital - Principal Software Engineer, Rust Genomics Infrastructure - Memphis, TN - ONSITE or REMOTE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stjude.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.stjude.org/</a></p>

<p>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is hiring Rust software engineers to rebuild the genomics ecosystem in Rust. We work at the intersection of computer science and genomics, and we're trying to build a better foundation upon which genomics can be done using Rust. Come work with the individuals that wrote the Rust-based bioinformatics library, noodles (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zaeleus&#x2F;noodles">https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles</a>), sprocket (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stjude-rust-labs&#x2F;wdl">https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/wdl</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stjude-rust-labs&#x2F;sprocket">https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket</a>), as well as many other projects (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stjude-rust-labs">https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs</a>).</p>

<p>NOTE that prior experience in bioinformatics or biology is NOT required for any of the positions below. You must be interested in learning though! If you'd like to get a sense of what you'd be learning, check out the guide we wrote to teach software engineers about genomics here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learngenomics.dev" rel="nofollow">https://learngenomics.dev</a>.</p>
