<p>We build web3 developer tools and are most focused on solving the "schlep" types of problems that every team ends up building in house but shouldn't have to.</p>

<p>We started about 3 years ago and have finally started to find product market fit. I'm looking to scale the engineering team so that I can focus more on growing the business.</p>
