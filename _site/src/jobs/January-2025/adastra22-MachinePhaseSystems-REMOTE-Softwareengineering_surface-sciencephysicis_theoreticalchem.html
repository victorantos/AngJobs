<p>Machine Phase Systems - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinephase.systems&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://machinephase.systems/</a> - REMOTE - Software engineering, surface-science physicis, theoretical chemistry, mechanical engineering</p>

<p>Machine Phase Systems is making a straight-shot attempt at the grand vision of molecular nanotechnology: scalable nano factories able to produce atomically precise products using radically new materials.</p>

<p>Open roles for chemistry and surface science, but also CAD/CAM software development, chemical simulations, mechanical design, and various internal software tools.</p>

<p>Software stack depends on the application of course, but we work with Rust whenever possible and Flutter/Dart for user interfaces and Python for scientific compute.</p>
