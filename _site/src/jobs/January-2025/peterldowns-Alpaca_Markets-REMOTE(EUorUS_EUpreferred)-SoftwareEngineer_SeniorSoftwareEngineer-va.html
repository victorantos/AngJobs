<p>Alpaca.Markets - REMOTE (EU or US, EU preferred) - Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer - varies on location</p>

<p>Alpaca <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpaca.markets&#x2F;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpaca.markets&#x2F;&lt;/a">0</a> offers brokerage APIs that let you (and your customers) trade various financial instruments all around the world. I'm helping Alpaca set up a new team focused on crypto perpetual futures â€” they're a really elegant abstraction for trading with varying leverage, and most crypto traders prefer to trade perps rather than spot.</p>

<p>We're looking for candidates who like ~greenfield engineering (brand new domain within Alpaca, some integration with the legacy systems is necessary but a lot of what we're doing is new) and actually writing code. Our hiring philosophy is to bring in the right people, pay them well, and give everyone meaningful work to do.</p>

<p>Alpaca as a whole is about 50 engineers. We're primarily golang microservices on top of kubernetes, but we'll use whatever tools are best to get the job done and satisfy our customers. To get an idea for the kind of work we do, check out what we shipped in 2024 <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpaca.markets&#x2F;blog&#x2F;alpaca-2024-year-in-review&#x2F;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpaca.markets&#x2F;blog&#x2F;alpaca-2024-year-in-review&#x2F;&lt;/a">1</a>.</p>
