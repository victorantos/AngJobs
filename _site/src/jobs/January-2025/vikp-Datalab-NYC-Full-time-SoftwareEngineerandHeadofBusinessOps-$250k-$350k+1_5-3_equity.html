<p>Datalab - NYC - Full-time - Software Engineer and Head of Business Ops - $250k-$350k  + 1.5-3% equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datalab.to" rel="nofollow">https://www.datalab.to</a></p>

<p>A significant % of useful data is locked away in tough-to-parse formats like PDFs.  We build tools to extract it, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VikParuchuri&#x2F;surya">https://github.com/VikParuchuri/surya</a> (15k Github stars), and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VikParuchuri&#x2F;marker">https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker</a> (19k stars).  We also run an inference API and product.</p>

<p>We do meaningful research (we’ve trained several SoTA models), ship product, and contribute to open source.  We’re hiring for 2 roles to help us scale:</p>

<p>Senior fullstack software engineer</p>

<pre><code>  - work across our open source repos, inference api, and frontend product
  - interact with our user community
  - you’ll need to be pragmatic, and embrace “boring” technology.  Our stack is fastapi, pytorch, htmx, postgres, and redis.  We deploy to render, and do inference with serverless gpus.
  - requires having built something impressive, ideally an open source project
</code></pre>
<p>Head of business operations</p>

<pre><code>  - first non-technical hire
  - work across multiple areas, including finance, hiring, and sales
  - you’ll need to be extremely organized and able to get a lot done
  - requires experience leading operations at an early stage
</code></pre>
