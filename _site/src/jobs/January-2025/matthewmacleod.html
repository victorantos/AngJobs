<p>Dexory - Lead Networking Engineer (IoT/Robotics) - London/Oxfordshire - HYBRID - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dexory.com" rel="nofollow">http://dexory.com</a></p>

<p>We are a post-series-B team building autonomous data capturing robots and related technology to improve the efficiency and accuracy of warehouses.</p>

<p>Our robots operate in challenging and unusual networking environments, and we need a dedicated networking engineer to help design, maintain, and troubleshoot customer deployments. This is a lead-level role that will give you the opportunity to set the strategy for our networking implementations now and in the future.</p>

<p>This isn’t a “design a big corporate network” kind of networking engineer - but instead a more open-ended role that can help us move quickly with setting up network links to our deployed robots over customer WiFi and cellular networks. You’ll probably be at home if you have deep knowledge about practical implementation of technology like WireGuard, know how to use Wireshark and read a pcap file, have played with OpenWRT, and can figure out why DNS isn’t working from two thousand miles away.</p>
