<p>I'm head of Software at Quatt, a quickly growing scaleup building heatpumps to help fix climate change. Heating and cooling is 50% of all energy used in the EU. Heat pumps save 10 times more CO2 for each Euro spent on them compared to electric cars. We're building the most accessible and smartest heatpumps on the market. Our first product is live, the next ones announced, we have thousands of customers, tons of data, and I really like the impact we're having. We also raised €25 million for further expansion. I’m currently looking for a few roles for my department, as we believe having the best software will allow us to have the best product. Our backend and frontend is Typescript.</p>

<p>I mostly wanted to highlight the Team Lead for Team Boss, which builds all tools needed to run our multi-million euro business - and we are as software driven as we can be. Looking for someone who can drive that team to great heights.</p>

<pre><code>  * Team Lead Team Boss (Engineering manager, Typescript)
  * Full stack developer (Typescript)
</code></pre>
<p>Now is a great time to join, as the software team is still small but growing quickly. These and other vacancies are on our careers page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quatt.io&#x2F;working-at-quatt" rel="nofollow">https://www.quatt.io/working-at-quatt</a> Email me directly ( my-hacker-news-username@quatt.io ) for questions or apply via the career page. We do look for people that can be in the office regularly, so not fully remote.</p>
