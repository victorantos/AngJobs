<p>Complete Sleep - Staff Backend Engineer - Full-time - New York, NY - Hybrid (Onsite 3 Days a Week) - $200k + equity/benefits - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mycompletesleep.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.mycompletesleep.com</a></p>

<p>Complete Sleep is a VC-backed, early stage company that is changing the way sleep apnea is tested, diagnosed, and treated so that patients can quickly get the help they need. About 1 in 4 adults has sleep apnea, and 80% of those people haven't even been diagnosed.</p>

<p>Our founding team is composed of early-stage veterans in each key area of our business. We care about our patients, the people we work with, and the people in our lives outside of work. Passion for our mission, having fun at work, and enjoying life outside of work are all important to us.</p>

<p>We're looking for a Staff Backend Engineer with 10+ years experience to lead our backend stack, working closely with our technical CTO. Our stack is built with golang, with NextJS frontends (there are multiple frontend apps). We're hosted on AWS in Dockerized containers and managed via Terraform. We have a stable, well-structured technical environment that is meant to empower engineers to build with quality, performance, and security in mind.</p>

<p>We're not legacy healthcare, and we never plan to be. If we're going to solve this problem, we have to build things well and transform the way people are treated. Come join us in helping people, while building great technology!</p>

<p>To apply or learn more, email rohen at mycompletesleep dot com. I'm also down to grab coffee if you're currently in NYC.</p>
