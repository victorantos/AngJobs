<p>I added pay ranges for the roles that have one listed, but I can also say that as a Staff Software Engineer on the mobile team, I make a bit over $200k base, in addition to bonus and equity.</p>

<p>All the usual benefits: equity, healthcare, 401k matching (Vanguard), unlimited PTO, etc. I take about 5 weeks a year, in addition to ~3 weeks worth of company holidays (federal holidays + the week of Christmas to New Years.)</p>

<p>You also get a sabbatical after 5 years of employment - I just got back from mine, and it was fantastic.</p>
