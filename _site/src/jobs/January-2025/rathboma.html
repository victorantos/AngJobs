<p>I need remote part/full time folks to help with the following:</p>

<p>============</p>

<p>Marketing / Growth</p>

<p>Write blog posts, email sequences, landing pages, ads, videos, etc. Must be comfortable with Markdown and HTML/CSS.
Goal: Help increase signups &amp; conversions, reduce churn.</p>

<p>============</p>

<p>Support &amp; QA</p>

<p>Test the application, respond to customer requests, help triage GitHub. Write automated tests. Opportunities to do other stuff like coding / marketing if interested.
Goal: Help our releases be rock-solid.</p>

<p>Location preference: Global! If you're in Latin America I can pay well and that's perfect for timezone overlap.</p>
