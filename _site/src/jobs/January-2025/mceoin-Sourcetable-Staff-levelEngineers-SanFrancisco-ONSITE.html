<p>Sourcetable - Staff-level Engineers - San Francisco - ONSITE - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcetable.com" rel="nofollow">https://sourcetable.com</a></p>

<p>We're building an AI spreadsheet and application platform for the next billion people. We are most commonly compared to Sheets/Gemini and Excel/Copilot, or referred to as "Cursor for Spreadsheets".</p>

<p>If you are an excellent full-stack engineer (React/Python) with good product sense and experience building hard things, please come talk to us. Most of our team are ex-founders, and there is an expectation that you can build end-to-end without requiring assistance from others. AI experience is nice but not required, this is a product engineering role.</p>

<p>There's a platform shift underway. Let's get after it!</p>
