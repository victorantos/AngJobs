<p>Elicit is an AI research assistant that uses language models to help researchers figure out what’s true and make better decisions. We've scaled to &gt;$3MM annual revenue and 400k MAU with our small team. We're hiring for multiple roles and are primarily interested in people with early-stage company experience, who are comfortable in high-agency, fast-paced teams.</p>

<p>Reasons you might want to join Elicit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We have been thinking about how to apply AI for high-stakes knowledge work since even before GPT-1. Elicit was spun-out from Ought (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ought.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://ought.org/</a>) which was more of a research lab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you're concerned about the potential downsides and risks of super-powerful AI: so are we! Happy to explain more of this story on a call, or you can also check e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ought.org&#x2F;updates&#x2F;2022-04-06-process" rel="nofollow">https://ought.org/updates/2022-04-06-process</a> for a primer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We like spending time with each other, and have get-togethers every 6 weeks, but we're flexible on location.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Reasons you might <em>not</em> want to join Elicit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We've found a level of product market fit (as evidenced by metrics) but we've not proven everything out yet. If you want predictability, Elicit is not for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We aim to hire people who thrive in low-bureaucracy environments, and let them loose. If you need structure, lots of support, close mentorship, or tightly-defined work assignments, Elicit is not for you.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
