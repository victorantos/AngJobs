<p>Purplefish - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purplefish.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https://purplefish.com/careers</a> - Member of Technical Staff - Full-Time - ONSITE - New York, NY, USA - NextJS, Typescript, Python - $150k-$225k + 0.5%-1%+</p>

<p>Purplefish is transforming the trillion-dollar talent industry with powerful AI agents that will fully automate most hiring processes end-to-end.</p>

<p>We are funded by 8VC, and Adam and I previously worked closely together to launch 145 companies at the venture studio Fractal Software out of a $650 million fund. Before that I was a staff software engineer at Lyft, and Adam was CRO at Wunderkind ($100m+ ARR). We've built a powerful voice agent, and are expanding into other parts of the sourcing-to-onboarding flow.</p>

<p>We're currently a team of 3 engineers in NYC (7 people total). We're working on really cool problems with multimodal AI agents (and some really not cool problems like ATS and HRIS integrations). I'm trying to build the engineering team that I would want to join, which to me means a high emphasis on agency, purpose, technical excellence, collaboration, learning and velocity.</p>

<p>We're building on LiveKit's agents framework and a host of other systems.</p>

<p>If that's interesting, let's talk.</p>
