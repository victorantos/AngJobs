<p>We are a small, scrappy team (4 engineers + UX consultants + CTO) with VC funding. The co-founders (CEO and CTO) are repeat entrepreneurs, ex-YC, and ex-Wall Street.</p>

<p>We are looking to bring in people to fill multiple roles.</p>

So if you're a dev who is looking to learn a bit about finance, or a quant who is looking to learn a bit more about software, martini.ai is the place for you. Prior experience in finance is a huge plus.</p>

<p>Tech stack: Python, Pandas, React, Next.js, AWS, Pytorch</p>
