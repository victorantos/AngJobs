<p>Artis Works - Senior Engineer Frontend and Backend (2 separate roles available) - Rust, Clojure, TypeScript - Remote (Europe time zone, UK preferred)</p>

<p>We’re building a collaborative, local-first set of tools that take raw financial market data from multiple financial exchanges and allows users to create excel-like formulas using both the market data and user-entered data as inputs. The problems we are solving are extremely challenging, but we have delivered a working V1 and have a rapidly growing dedicated user base and recently secured VC funding.</p>

<p>Both roles are for senior developers:</p>

<pre><code>  - Frontend is React&#x2F;strict TypeScript&#x2F;local-first DB + sync engine, custom formula evaluation engine written in rust compiled to WASM (no Rust&#x2F;WASM expertise necessary for this role)
  - Backend is mostly Rust + some Clojure (no Clojure experience needed), k8s&#x2F;Postgres Aurora, QuestDB, Kafka.
</code></pre>
<p>We’re a (currently 5-person) remote dev team mostly based in the UK with an office near Victoria if you prefer to work from there. We’re looking for people who have a strong focus on performance and familiarity with the languages and tools we use. Salary range is £100k-£140k + bonus + laptop of your choice.</p>

<p>We try to keep red tape and bureaucracy to a minimum and mostly just use linear and slack for collaboration but are always open to process suggestions from anyone on the team.</p>
