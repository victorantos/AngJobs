<p>Dirac - Software Engineer (£80k) + 0.5% equity, Sales/Ops (£60k + bonus) + 0.5% equity- London, Acton - In-person
Run rate: £3m (Aug '24) up from £1.05m (jul '23) Backed by patio11 &amp; backedvc, we're an exporting startup!</p>

<p>To the software engineer: offering a chance to write code as either our third or fourth engineer (django/postgres/python), learn to drive a forklift (Hyster J2.0UTT) and wire up label printers (brother-ql 1100c + a new zebra one which I bricked using Chat GPT sending commands directly through).</p>

<p>Experience as a forklift driver or as a software engineer not essential.</p>

<p>Sales/Operations: help us open new marketplaces; get stock to whomever you sold it to; also learn to drive a forklift; dealing with compliance, licenses and related issues; map navigation skills and aviation a plus (the last one was a joke, but if you can drive that might be handy).</p>

<p>The roles would ideally start in late September/early October, as we are planning on reaching £1m/month in December 2024.</p>

<p>Email me ethan@dirac.software if interested.</p>
