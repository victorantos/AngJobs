<p>Stealth Startup - NYC/Remote - Full-time/Part-time initially</p>

<p>I'm looking for a highly technical co-founder that wants to bootstrap a profitable company. My experience is 10+ years of SWE, most recently at FAANG. After that, I co-founded a venture backed startup as CTO.</p>

<p>The areas I am currently prospecting are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AI for Human Resources Vertical SAAS.</li>
</ol>

<p>The area is ripe for disruption, and I believe that in the coming decade a significant percentage of HR, particularly recruiting, will be automated. I have a few specific ideas I want to run down.</p>

<p>As for more about who I am looking for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You are extremely technical across a number of areas: Front End, Cloud, AWS, Back End, Java, Typescript, Python, streaming, NextJS, agentic workflows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You want to play a non-technical role in the beginning.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Distribution is everything, and so while I am a programmer at heart, I will spend the next few months prospecting the market, and attempting to sell different HR solutions into different vertical markets. I want to make a science out of testing the market, and then quickly execute on the technical product.</p>
