<p>The Navigator <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;navigator.riskquest.com" rel="nofollow">https://navigator.riskquest.com</a> is a leading Dutch-market bank transaction analytics platform used by our clients to gain in-depth and current financial insights about their clients. We process bank data (transactions and account information) via PSD2 or file uploads, classify transactions into categories, compute analytics and provide clients access through an API and dashboard. Beyond the Navigator, we are also involved in various risk and treasury management software solutions within the broader Zanders team.</p>
