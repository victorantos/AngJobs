<p>I'm head of Software at Quatt, a quickly growing scaleup building heatpumps to help fix climate change. Heating and cooling is 50% of all energy used in the EU. Heat pumps save 10 times more CO2 for each Euro spent on them compared to electric cars. We're building the most accessible and smartest heatpumps on the market. Our first product is live, the next ones announced, we have thousands of customers, tons of data, and I really like the impact we're having. We also just raised €25 million for further expansion. I’m currently looking for a few roles for my department, as we believe having the best software will allow us to have the best product. Our backend and frontend is Typescript.</p>

<pre><code>  * Senior Backend developer (Typescript)
  * Senior QA &#x2F; test engineer
  * Senior app developer (React native)
  * Devops engineer for our fleet of thousands of devices
  * Data Architect (AWS)
</code></pre>
