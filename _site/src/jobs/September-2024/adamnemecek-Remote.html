<p>Traceoid (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;traceoid.ai" rel="nofollow">http://traceoid.ai</a>) - Remote</p>

<p>We are working on making energy-based models (EBMs) viable by revisiting some of the math that underlies machine learning.
Here is what Yann LeCun had to say about EBMs <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;ylecun&#x2F;status&#x2F;1380066315600343042" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/ylecun/status/1380066315600343042</a></p>

<p>Please reach out if you have background in any of these or related fields (or are excited to learn):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>integrable systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>category theory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>functional programming</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>compilers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statistical mechanics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>computational physics</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our company operates at the intersection of research &amp; development, and as a part of this job, you will be reading papers and implementing some very cool research from the above fields. Ideal candidate would understand how one goes about writing high perf code as well as be able to explain the concept of a Hamiltonian.
If we succeed, our approach will mark a significant step forward towards achieving AGI.</p>

<p>We are currently in the final stages of establishing the company and to that end, we are in the process of working out the exact positions, salary ranges and such. As a result, we might not be officially hiring for another month. That being said, if the job sounds interesting, please do not hesitate and contact us at adamnemecek+hnhiring@gmail.com.
In addition, while we are finalizing investments, there might still be some space left in the current round, so if you are interested in hearing our pitch, please reach out to adamnemecek+hninvestments@gmail.com.
