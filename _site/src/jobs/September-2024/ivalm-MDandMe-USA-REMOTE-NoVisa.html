<p>MDandMe - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdme.ai" rel="nofollow">https://mdme.ai</a> - USA - REMOTE - No Visa</p>

<p>We want to help every person to feel in control of their healthcare: to know what's going on with their body and to not feel alone.</p>

<p>MDandMe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdme.ai" rel="nofollow">https://mdme.ai</a>) builds generative AI technology that allows people to make sense of their health at all steps along their healthcare journey: from a conversational symptom checker when you first feel unwell, to a community where you are matched to others with near-identical medical histories, to follow-up conversations where you can have diagnostic reports, lab values, and doctors notes explained in plain language.</p>

<p>Since our soft launch in February 2024, we’ve helped over 50,000 people in all 50 states. To learn more read our recent blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdme.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;in-the-know" rel="nofollow">https://mdme.ai/blog/2024/06/03/in-the-know</a></p>

<p>We are looking for a Mobile SWE (React Native, iOS + Android): over 93% of our traffic comes from mobile devices. Right now we are a React/NextJS webapp and are currently building a React Native mobile app. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swift-step-f49.notion.site&#x2F;Mobile-SWE-06f94fd945bd4f52801a8b6657dc9072" rel="nofollow">https://swift-step-f49.notion.site/Mobile-SWE-06f94fd945bd4f…</a></p>
