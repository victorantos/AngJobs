<p>Atomic Tessellator - Full-Time - REMOTE - HQ: New Zealand</p>

<p>Here at Atomic Tessellator, we are speeding up the idea -&gt; simulation -&gt; result loop for small molecule chemistry and materials science. We empower scientists to conduct experiments faster and easier. Our platform modernises computational materials science, allowing horizontal scaling of simulations on Kubernetes clusters, diffusion models for structure discovery, LLM assistants to write and debug experiments, and a lot more! Fork simulations like programmers fork code.</p>

<p>Senior infrastructure engineer - You will be responsible for automating a lot of our K8s setup, implementing our Helm packaging and CI/CD pipelines. While initially there's a lot of DevOps in this role, theres room to grow into a combination DevOps and Distributed Systems Programming, this role would suit a DevOps person who is excited to transition into some coding. You must be a Python and Kubernetes expert.</p>

<p>Junior Data Scientist - You will be responsible for implementing research papers, monitoring existing experiments, and helping automate a lot of the platform features and testing. This is a very varied role suitable for a novelty-seeking problem solver. For this role a positive attitude and growth mindset is more important than experience, you will be mentored by the founding team.</p>
