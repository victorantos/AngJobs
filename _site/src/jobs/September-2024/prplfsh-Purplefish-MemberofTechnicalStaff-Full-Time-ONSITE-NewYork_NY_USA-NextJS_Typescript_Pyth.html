<p>Purplefish - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;purplefish.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https://purplefish.com/careers</a> - Member of Technical Staff - Full-Time - ONSITE - New York, NY, USA - NextJS, Typescript, Python - $175k-$225k + 0.5%-1.5%</p>

<p>Purplefish is transforming the trillion-dollar talent industry with powerful AI agents that will fully automate most hiring processes end-to-end.</p>

<p>We are funded by 8VC, and Adam and I previously worked closely together to launch 145 companies at the venture studio Fractal Software out of a $650 million fund. Before that I was a staff software engineer at Lyft, and Adam was CRO at Wonderkind ($100m+ ARR).  It's early days, but we have a deep bench of design partners lined up that we are going to be onboarding starting in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>We're building a small and world-class team of technical people in-person in NYC. We're working on really cool problems with multimodal AI agents (and some really not cool problems like ATS and HRIS integrations). I'm trying to build the engineering team that I would want to join, which to me means a high emphasis on agency, purpose, technical excellence, collaboration, learning and velocity.</p>

<p>If that's interesting, let's talk.</p>
