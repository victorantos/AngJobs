<p>Learnwise.ai - Junior-Mid AI/ML/Backend Engineer (fulltime) - REMOTE (~EU timezone if freelance contract OR Spain/NL for employee contract) - 2-4.5k EUR/month</p>

<p>We build an LLM-based conversational assistant deeply integrated in the Edtech ecosystem. We aim to relieve teachers and admin workers of tedious "easy" questions so they can focus on what's important. Moving towards knowledge management and course support.</p>

<p>Early startup, small, tightly knit team (5 engineers, 2 implementation/process-focused folks, 1 sales guy, 1 marketing gal, 1 chill product-centered CEO). We're slowly scaling and expanding.</p>

<p>Stack (not crucial but you should at least be proficient in python):</p>

<ul>
  <li>FastAPI python backend - MongoDB - Langsmith (llm evals/observability) -  - Next.js (react) frontend - AWS</li>
</ul>

<p>We're a startup. We need a generalist/"get things done" mentality, and sufficient drive/curiosity to figure things out (and build them/fix them) on your own - we don't micromanage.</p>

<p>About the position: you'd start off supporting me with developing the AI aspects of the product - for now, mainly the conversational interface. This isn't a purely ML position; for now lots of the work is SWE/back-end dev. Projects on the roadmap: building robust testing and observability for LLM performance, experimenting with and improving the RAG pipeline, fine-tuning/distillation where relevant to reduce latency/costs, working on a voice interface.</p>

<p>Experience requirements: ~masters level education in relevant field (doesn't have to be a masters/formal education, but you need to convince us you have an equivalent level of experience/understanding) &amp; 1y of full-time relevant work experience (can be as student job)</p>

<p>WE'RE UNFORTUNATELY UNABLE TO SPONSOR VISAS.</p>
