<p>Formal - Founding Software Engineer (Compilers, Networking) - REMOTE - Full-Time - &gt;= $200k + 2% equity</p>

<p>We're rethinking the computing stack from the ground up for truly elastic, soundly isolated, instantly and globally available execution. Weâ€™re building OS interfaces and compilers for low overhead, formally verified isolation without containers or VMs. We're starting with the network: a programming language to replace eBPF and enable globally programmable networking as a service.</p>

<p>We are VC-funded ($700k pre-seed), advised by professors from MIT and UWaterloo, and founded by ex-Stanford PhDs. There are two official roles, but we welcome conversations with anyone interested in joining the team.</p>
