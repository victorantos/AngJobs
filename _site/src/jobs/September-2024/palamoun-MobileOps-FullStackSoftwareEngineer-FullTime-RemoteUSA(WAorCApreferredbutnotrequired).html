<p>MobileOps - Full Stack Software Engineer - Full Time - Remote USA (WA or CA preferred but not required) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobileops.co" rel="nofollow">https://www.mobileops.co</a></p>

<p>[ Company Information ]
MobileOps is a bootstrapped and profitable software company that sells SaaS ("MobileOps") to companies that own fleets of workboats or heavy construction assets. We have a vertically integrated app that serves as a one-stop shop for companies when it comes to asset maintenance, safety/compliance, crewing, dispatching, logistics, inventory, and much more.</p>

<p>We've just begun to release new sets of features that focus on logistics for workboat companies that tow barges in the inland rivers of the USA (imagine 100k+ barges being pushed by towboats in rivers that carve through the American heartland, and all the major complexities that comes with tracking barges w/ cargo, optimizing schedules and tows, and generating invoices based off many movements and types of events).</p>

<p>In addition, we've started to attract attention outside the maritime world, and we're excited about new opportunities to bring MobileOps to similar industries.</p>

<p>[ Role ] 
We're looking for a highly motivated individual with 5+ years of professional software engineering experience—one who takes ownership of projects, has an eye for great UI/UX, and gets quality work completed on time (understanding, at a deep level, perfection v.s. shipping). The role will require collaboration with colleagues and customers to ensure we're building the right features and providing value. If you're an individual that doesn't want to be siloed and desires to engage with customers on Zoom calls (and even occasional onsite visits with other team members) this might be a good role for you.</p>

<p>MobileOps is a remote-first company with team members currently located in Washington and California. Work hours are in the Pacific time zone. Full time = 40 hours a week. We offer benefits (health, vision, dental) and 401(k) matching.</p>

<p>[ Stack ]
MobileOps' BE is Ruby on Rails and the FE is almost 100% React components. While the frameworks are fairly standard, the problems we need to solve are quite out of the ordinary due to the nature of industry we serve, and there's a lot of challenging and unique problems to be solved outside of basic CRUD interfaces.</p>
