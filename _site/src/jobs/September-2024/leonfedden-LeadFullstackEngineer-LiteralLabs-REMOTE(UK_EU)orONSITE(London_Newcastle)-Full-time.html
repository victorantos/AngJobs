<p>We all have a sense that AI has the potential to change the world for the better; to push humanity forward. To fulfil its potential, artificial intelligence must run at the edge wherever it is needed, and not be dependent on cloud connectivity. To meet society's needs, AI has to be explainable, it has to be fast, and it has to be economically and energy efficient. Literal Labs is working to make that happen.</p>

<p>At Literal Labs, we are pioneers in the AI sector, dedicated to transforming the landscape of technology through innovative AI solutions. With a foundation deeply rooted in engineering and scientific excellence, we strive to create impactful tools and applications that redefine the interaction between humans and technology. Our commitment to high-quality work, employee development, and a collaborative culture makes us a beacon for those who aspire to shape the future of AI.</p>

<p>As the Product Engineering Pod Lead, you will be at the forefront of architecting and developing web applications and cloud solutions that integrate our groundbreaking Tsetlin Machine technology.</p>

<p>This role is pivotal in turning sophisticated AI capabilities into accessible, user-friendly products that will revolutionise how our customers interact with AI. You will collaborate directly with the CTO and other pod leaders to ensure our technological solutions are robust, scalable, and aligned with Literal Labsâ€™ strategic goals.</p>

<p>Please note: We are looking for a generalist in this role, an experienced set of hands that has overseen the complete lifecycle of web applications in previous experiences, and has solved the plethora of issues that arise along the way.</p>

<p>What We Offer; a place for ambitious people, a dynamic role in a rapidly growing company at the cutting edge of AI technology; a company for personal development: Opportunities for professional growth through our culture, conferences, training, and courses, with resources available from our partnership with Newcastle University; no politics, no red-tape, but instead an exciting space: A collaborative, innovative, and fun work environment (because it should be) where your voice is valued, we pull together, and your contributions define the future of the company; benefits include early stage equity, pension scheme and an unlimited holiday scheme.</p>
