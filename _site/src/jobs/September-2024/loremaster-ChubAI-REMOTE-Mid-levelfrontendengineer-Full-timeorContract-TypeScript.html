<p>Chub AI - REMOTE - Mid-level frontend engineer - Full-time or Contract - TypeScript</p>

<p>We are the largest generative AI gaming platform, entirely self-funded and profitable since August 2023.</p>

<p>Our frontend is React TypeScript, and the bulk of the backend APIs are Flask. We’re looking for someone with a relevant degree and a few years of experience, for exclusively or mostly frontend work. An eye for design and aesthetics is needed as we have none. Ever having worked with Ant Design, Capacitor, or react-three-fiber would be a big plus. Your most likely first project would be a better UI for our image and video generation API.</p>

<p>How to Apply: Send however you prefer to represent yourself — a resume, a site, a GitHub, all or none of the above — along with salary expectations to hiring@chub.ai.</p>
