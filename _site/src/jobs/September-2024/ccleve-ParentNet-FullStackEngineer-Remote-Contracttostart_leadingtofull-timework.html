<p>ParentNet - Full Stack Engineer - Remote - Contract to start, leading to full-time work</p>

<p>ParentNet is a very early-stage startup that aims to provide parents within a school with a communications platform to talk among themselves. The goal is to give parents a tool to find out what's going on and to organize themselves. This is by parents, for parents.</p>

<p>ParentNet will likely be a not-for-profit, governed primarily by those who believe in parent's rights. Funding is available for this project.</p>

<p>Development has not yet started, which means you'll have a role in picking the tools to do the job. You must be familiar with developing database apps in either Java or Python.</p>

<p>You will work closely with the founder (me) to get the app built. I'm a developer myself, but do not have the hours available to get this done. We'll make technical decisions together.</p>

<p>Email me if you agree with the core mission, and you have the hours available to make this happen. Send me a link to your past work and your LinkedIn. chris at ccleve dot com</p>
