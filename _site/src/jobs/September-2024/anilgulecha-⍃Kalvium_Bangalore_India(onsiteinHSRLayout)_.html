<p>Kalvium, Bangalore, India (onsite in HSR Layout).</p>

<p>Hi folks, I'm hiring in the engineering team at Kalvium across SDE2 to Lead levels. We are build the google-maps of education - the only edtech where we bring a focused, standardized, digital approach to CS education.</p>

<p>Here's 3 cool things we've done:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>100% AI based evaluators in B.Tech CS 4 year program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launched our full-fledged program in 20+ universities in India, where students are placed from 3rd semester onwards. This year we've had more premium universities signup: SRM, VIT, Christ, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To align you to our approach: we seek out engineers who want to involve with this problem statements. Edtech v1.0 in India does not have a good rep (tell me about it!), but the problem statements remains: higher education system is broken, and not giving students the outcomes they are capable of (Here's the outcomes we deliver - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;hire-from-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://kalvium.com/hire-from-us/</a>).</p>

<p>Our main realization is: we can't rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students. That's what we've built and launched in above universities (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalvium.com&#x2F;heros&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://kalvium.com/heros/</a>). We have a 12 year roadmap! it's a blue ocean, and we want to build and lead Edtech V2.0.</p>

<p>Note on team/compensation: We plan on being a small core team that geeks out on learning and platform-izing it! Our pay is commensurate in the 60-70th percentile of the market, and we add-on meaningful equity. We plan for a 4 year path of growth for every individual in our team. If this sounds like a meaningful challenge and place to build your career, please reach out to me via anil@kalvium.com with your resume.</p>
