<p>Aleph - REMOTE PT - ET Hours - AI Software Engineers (frontend, backend and fullstack), Account Executive, BDR, Finance Solutions Engineer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getaleph.com">https://www.getaleph.com</a></p>

<p>Aleph is redefining the world of Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A). We operate in a well-defined software category with a multi-billion TAM, yet a lack of a clear winner. We’re here to change that, and our early results speak for themselves.</p>

<p>We’re backed by top VCs (Bain Capital Ventures, Khosla Ventures, YC, Picus Capital), and work with customers like Eight Sleep, Webflow, Turo, Notion, Zapier and others.</p>

<p>What we’ve built so far is the most seamless way to centralize all of a company's financial data – think expenses from Quickbooks or Netsuite, pipeline forecasts from Salesforce – and bring it into the tools finance teams are already using. But the vision goes way beyond that. We’re building the source of truth for a business’ data, and ultimately the platform businesses use to make better decisions.</p>

<p>We’re way ahead of schedule due to our unique approach, with pretty much no churn, and rapid growth despite barely any marketing spend to date.</p>
