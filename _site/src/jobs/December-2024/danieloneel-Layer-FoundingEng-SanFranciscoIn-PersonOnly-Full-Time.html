<p>Layer - Founding Eng - San Francisco In-Person Only - Full-Time</p>

<p>We're not looking for a specific skillset. Our philosophy is to find exceptional teammates who want to be a part of high-ownership team and believe this opportunity allows them to use their strengths. If you want to tackle serious technical challenges across system design, scale, and data management and you care about being on a team that has high expectations for our product and ourselves, get in touch with me at daniel [at] layerfi.com</p>

<p>We’re building SMB accounting software API-first so that it can be integrated directly into software platforms where business owners already work. Our customers are vertical software platforms in the vein of Toast, MindBody or Housecall Pro that help small business owners start, run and scale their business with workflows and financial products. We help them serve their customers who are stuck exporting all their data out of these systems into CSVs and importing it back into other accounting software.</p>

<p>Integrating with our accounting APIs gives business owners automation &amp; accounting workflows directly within their core software while the software platforms get to solve one their customers’ biggest pain points: worrying about bookkeeping &amp; finances.</p>
