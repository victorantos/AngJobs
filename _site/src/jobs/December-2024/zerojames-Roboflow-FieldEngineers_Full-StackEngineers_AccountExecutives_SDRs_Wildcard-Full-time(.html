<p>Roboflow - Field Engineers, Full-Stack Engineers, Account Executives, SDRs, Wildcard - Full-time (Remote, SF, NYC, Sa√µ Paulo) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;careers?ref=whoishiring1224">https://roboflow.com/careers?ref=whoishiring1224</a></p>

<p>Roboflow is the fastest way to use computer vision in production. We help developers give their software the sense of sight. Our end-to-end platform <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring1224&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring1224&lt;/a">1</a> provides tooling for image collection, annotation, dataset exploration and curation, training, and deployment.</p>

<p>Over 1 million engineers (including engineers from 2/3 Fortune 100 companies) build with Roboflow. We now host the largest collection of open source computer vision datasets and pre-trained models <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;universe?ref=whoishiring1224&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roboflow.com&#x2F;universe?ref=whoishiring1224&lt;/a">2</a>. We are pushing forward the CV ecosystem with open source projects like Autodistill <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;autodistill&#x2F;autodistill&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;autodistill&#x2F;autodistill&lt;/a">3</a> and Supervision <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roboflow&#x2F;supervision&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roboflow&#x2F;supervision&lt;/a">4</a>. And we've built one of the most comprehensive resources for software engineers to learn to use computer vision with our popular blog <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring1224&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.roboflow.com&#x2F;?ref=whoishiring1224&lt;/a">5</a> and YouTube channel <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Roboflow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Roboflow&lt;/a">6</a>.</p>

<p>We have several openings available but are primarily looking for strong technical generalists who want to help us democratize computer vision and like to wear many hats and have an outsized impact. Our engineering culture is built on a foundation of autonomy &amp; we don't consider an engineer fully ramped until they can "choose their own loss function". At Roboflow, engineers aren't just responsible for building things but also for helping us figure out what we should build next. We're builders &amp; problem solvers; not just coders. (For this reason we also especially love hiring past and future founders.)</p>

<p>We're currently hiring for full-stack engineers to help build our product, field engineers that work directly with our customers to solve their business needs with computer vision, and several technical roles on the sales team.</p>

<p>We just raised our Series B round, led by GV. With this round, we will continue building the open source tools, platform, and community so developers and enterprises can deploy computer vision applications to production. <a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.roboflow.com&#x2F;series-b&#x2F;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.roboflow.com&#x2F;series-b&#x2F;&lt;/a">7</a></p>
