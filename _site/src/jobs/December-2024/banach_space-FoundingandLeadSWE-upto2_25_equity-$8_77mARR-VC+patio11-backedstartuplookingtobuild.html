<p>Founding and Lead SWE - upto 2.25% equity - $8.77m ARR - VC+patio11-backed startup looking to build the Walmart for import-export - London - In-Person</p>

<p>Merry Christmas! We're looking to hire our first Senior / Lead SWE. Significant equity on the table and competitive salary (inversely proportional with the equity offer, think b/w 1 and 2.25). We've grown 3.28x in the last year and your mission is to help us maintain the exponential!</p>

<p>You'll be helping build the software backend for the Walmart of import-export. That means integrations for new marketplaces and suppliers, accountancy, pricing and order optimisation, logistics etc. You'll be reporting to the co-founder/ceo but also reviewing his code &lt;'the most disorganised code i have seen in my entire life' said one person in a code review, apologies!!!&gt; :)</p>

<p>What we do: we buy stock in one country and sell it to customers in a different country. Stock purchasing and logistics is handled by an internal backend which you will be helping to write!</p>

<p>About you: &gt;1.5σ on ambition, &gt;2.15σ on building amazing things, &gt;1σ on being good company in the office at 10pm. Generally formidable. Has some business sense. Wants to drive a forklift (our office and warehouse are on the same site).</p>
