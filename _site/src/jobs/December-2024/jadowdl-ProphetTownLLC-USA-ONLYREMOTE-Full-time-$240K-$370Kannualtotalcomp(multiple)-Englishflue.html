<p>Prophet Town LLC - Full-Stack Engineer + PM + DevOps/Infra - USA-ONLY REMOTE - Full-time - $240K-$370K annual total comp (multiple) - English fluency required</p>

<p>I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a small, fully-remote, sf-bay-area-based, boutique indie tech agency. Our leadership staff are all ex-Fortune 100; everybody codes. Notable recent projects: voltagepark.com and a slackbot for Anduril’s employees.</p>

<p>Unlike earlier HN Who's Hiring posts, we have specific existing clients in mind: total comp is not flexible hourly, but full-time salary with client-tied equity compensation. We are currently filling “Tier 3” (5-10 y/o/e, $240K-$320K annual comp) and "Tier 4" (7-20 y/o/e, $300K-$370K annual total comp) roles:</p>

<pre><code>    Engineers: Full stack polyglot but JS&#x2F;TS heavy (SQL&#x2F;NextJS&#x2F;Node&#x2F;React, Remix+ReactNative and gen-ai nice-to-have), AWS deployments.  

    Infra+Devops: Kubernetes&#x2F;Docker, Terraform, AWS service set, common CI&#x2F;CD options.
</code></pre>
<p>We’re a worker-first operation. Applicants must meet a high bar; in return, I pledge my personal commitment to finding you interesting work and getting you good pay.</p>

<p>We tend to get swamped with resumes lately; we're doing something new and trying a Google Form to collect application submissions (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;1Kknc1EPrQ6jyCNd6" rel="nofollow">https://forms.gle/1Kknc1EPrQ6jyCNd6</a>).  If you submit by Friday night (December 6th, Pacific time) we plan to at least confirm those submissions on Saturday.  You are free to submit again even if you have in the past.</p>

<p>You can ping me at hn-hiring@ptown.tech too, though a form submission above will actually get priority (there's a lot of submission spam to emails in HN posts…).</p>
