<p>Figma - Senior/Staff Security Engineer - Remote or Hybrid (US/CA) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;job-boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;figma&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4214880004" rel="nofollow">https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/figma/jobs/4214880004</a></p>

<p>Figma does web-based software for Design and Productivity, kinda like Photoshop merged with Google Docs (live collaboration). We use FigJam a lot internally for meetings which is like a shared whiteboard.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm on the security team and we're looking to hire more folks as the rapidly company scales.</p>

<p>The Security team is unique in wanting engineers with both a coding and security background. If you are a classic SWE but possess security-fu then you're welcome to apply! That's the route I took and many of the other folks on the team have too.</p>

<p>My sub-team, AI Security, works on the security of our new AI features (mostly hardening infrastructure and making the data we train on anonymized). My personal focus has been on security of our data recently (Snowflake mostly) which has been a new domain for me.</p>

<p>The other teams are focused around Application Security and Infrastructure Security (with some "endpoint" aka Mac security sprinkled in).</p>

<p>The roles are broad and if you're interested you're welcome to apply on the link above. I can respond to questions at fwortley at figma dot com too, but heads up that I may be high latency with the upcoming holidays!</p>

<p>Also note: The bar is really Senior and up. The company doesn't really hire below that unless you go through the internship program or have a strong personal referral for a team with an opening. (~5 years of experience being the rough rule of thumb unless you're already Senior at a 200+ engineer company.)</p>

<p>Anyway, happy holidays y'all and thanks for reading!</p>
