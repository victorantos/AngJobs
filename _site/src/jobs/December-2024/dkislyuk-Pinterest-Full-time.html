<p>Pinterest - San Francisco, New York, or hybrid/remote (US-only) - ML Engineer / Applied Research Scientist - Full-time</p>

<p>Pinterest’s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) is hiring for an engineering position on our visual modeling team for developing Pinterest Canvas. Canvas is a foundation text-to-image model developed internally for helping various visualization, inpainting, and outpainting products. In this role, you’ll get to work with Pinterest’s rich visual-text dataset to build large-scale generative models which are continuously being shipped to production. The core Canvas pod is a small group (~6 engineers) inside of ATG, which focuses on a broad variety of AI/ML initiatives, such as core computer vision, multimodal representation learning, heterogeneous graph neural networks, recommender systems, etc.</p>

<p>New-grads are welcome to apply (preferably with a masters or PhD). Candidates should have diffusion modeling experience (e.g. diffusion transformers, LoRA fine-tuning, complex {text, image} conditioning, style transfer, etc.) and some form of industry experience. Engineers within ATG have a lot of leeway in terms of product contribution, so both ML engineers and research scientists are welcome to apply. We encourage the team to regularly publish, and the role can be either in person (SF, NY) or hybrid is preferred.</p>

<p>Please reach out to me directly (dkislyuk@pinterest.com) if you’re interested.</p>
