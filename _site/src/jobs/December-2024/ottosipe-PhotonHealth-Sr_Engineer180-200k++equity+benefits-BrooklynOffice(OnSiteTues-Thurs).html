<p>Photon Health - Sr. Engineer 180-200k+ + equity + benefits - Brooklyn Office (OnSite Tues-Thurs) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ph.tn&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https://ph.tn/jobs</a></p>

<p>Hey it's Otto, co-founder and CEO of Photon.</p>

<p>We're hiring product-savvy engineers who crave ownership and growth opportunity. Join our mission-driven team in Williamsburg and help us disrupt a legacy healthcare monopoly!</p>

<p>Photon restores patients ownership of prescriptions. Our platform enables clinicians to send prescriptions to patients via text, enabling their patients to shop between pharmacies. The vision is to help consumers save money by increasing transparency.</p>

<p>Our product supports over a million patients a year, and we're growing rapidly - sustaining +50% quarterly growth over the last two years. We're backed by top investors like Notation, Flare, Susa, and Box Group and have raised a total of $16M. We closed our most recent round of funding in July and are expanding the engineering and sales teams.</p>
