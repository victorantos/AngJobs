<p>Zetier - Multiple US Locations (VA, PA, FL, CA, NY) - ONSITE - Full-Time - Cybersecurity / Engineering</p>

<p>Zetier delivers offensive &amp; defensive cybersecurity capabilities and tools to serve our nation. If you’re passionate about your work, then join us in creating, advocating for, and advancing solutions that make a real-world impact. We’re looking for a range of folks, including an Android Security Engineer, a Vulnerability Researcher, CNO Engineers, a Sr Tech Lead, and a Business Developer.</p>

<p>We thrive on solving deep technical challenges that stretch the limits of low-level engineering expertise. As an engineer, you get to truly shape the tools we create and customize the services we provide. Whether you’re writing kernel modules, exploring memory corruption vulnerabilities, developing hardened Linux distributions, or performing static analysis of GCC-compiled binaries, every day offers opportunities to innovate. This is work for engineers who enjoy delving into the details — down to hex dumps, syscall traces, and debugging through layers of obfuscation.</p>

<p>Note: Hires must be able to obtain and maintain a US security clearance.</p>
