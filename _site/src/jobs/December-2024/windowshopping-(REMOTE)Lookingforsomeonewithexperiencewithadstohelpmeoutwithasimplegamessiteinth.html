<p>(REMOTE) Looking for someone with experience with ads to help me out with a simple games site in the vein of Wordle or 2048. Site is written in Typescript frontend and back. Express.js backend and React frontend.</p>

<p>Basically a one-time gig project, not a full-time position. I don't know much about setting ads up and have had limited luck in my initial research into it since it seemed Google Ads doesn't support sites that aren't full of rich text content (i.e. not games sites) and most other ad providers require you to already have a large userbase or else to use them as your DNS which I didn't want to do.</p>

<p>Email in profile.</p>
