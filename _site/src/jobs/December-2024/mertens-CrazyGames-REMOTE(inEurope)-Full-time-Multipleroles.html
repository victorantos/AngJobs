<p>CrazyGames - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.crazygames.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://about.crazygames.com/</a> - REMOTE (in Europe) - Full-time - Multiple roles</p>

<p>With recent technologies such as WebGPU and WebAssembly, the browser is quickly becoming a powerful gaming platform. High-quality 3D graphics and near-native level performance are becoming possible without the need for downloads, apps, or platform-specific development. Our browser games platform is already reaching more than 35 million people per month. We are self-funded, profitable, remote-first, and fast-growing.</p>

<p>We are currently looking for multiple people on the product and engineering side to bring our product to the next level.</p>

<p>Please note that we're looking for people who can work on a European timezone and are ideally based in Europe (which includes the UK for those in doubt).</p>
