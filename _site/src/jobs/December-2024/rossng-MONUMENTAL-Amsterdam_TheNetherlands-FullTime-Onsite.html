<p>MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.monumental.co/</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite</p>

<p>We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.</p>

<p>We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a software stack that lets us prototype on the fly. Right now, we have multiple robots deployed on real construction sites and have started making revenue from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.</p>

<p>The full team is now about 45 people (and still growing fast!) There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building and we need talented people to meet it.</p>

<p>Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.</p>

<p>Last month we started hiring for a new role: Forward Deployed Robotics Engineer (also open to interns). We are looking for people can bridge the gap between software engineering and the construction site: operating the robot; spotting opportunities to build faster and better; and rapidly hacking them into existence.</p>

<p>My colleague has written a blog post[1] about his experience in this role - give it a read if you're interested.</p>

<p>Other open roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Software Engineer, Controls</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Software Engineer, Machine Vision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assembly/manufacturing technicians and robot operators</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. We're always on the lookout for very strong generalist engineers who can operate at any layer of the stack (firmware, networking, UI, application code - whatever's needed!)</p>
