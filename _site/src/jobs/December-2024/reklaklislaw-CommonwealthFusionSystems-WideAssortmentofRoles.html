<p>Commonwealth Fusion Systems - Wide Assortment of Roles - Remote &amp; Onsite (Somerville MA, Devens MA) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfs.energy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://cfs.energy/</a></p>

<p>Decades of worldwide, government-sponsored research in fusion science have established the tokamak-based configuration as the leading approach to confining fusion-grade plasmas with strong magnetic fields. Yet, in the past, even state-of-the art superconducting magnet technology required tokamaks to be enormous to produce net fusion energy. Recently, a new high temperature superconductor has reached industrial maturity. CFS is using these high temperature superconductors to build smaller and lower-cost tokamak fusion systems. CFS will build first-of-its-kind high temperature superconducting magnets, followed by the worldâ€™s first net energy-producing fusion machine, called SPARC. SPARC will pave the way for the first commercially viable fusion power plant, called ARC. CFS is assembling a world-class team working to design and build fusion machines that will provide limitless, clean, fusion energy to combat climate change.</p>
