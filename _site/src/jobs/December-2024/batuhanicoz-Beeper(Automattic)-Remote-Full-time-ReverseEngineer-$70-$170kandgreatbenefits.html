<p>Beeper (Automattic) - Remote - Full-time - Reverse Engineer - $70-$170k and great benefits</p>

<p>Beeper unifies all your chats across networks in one app. We are looking for people to join our incredible team of reverse engineers that build our integrations with chat networks. Like most software at Automattic, all of our bridge work is open source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mautrix">https://github.com/mautrix</a> (and more of our stack is open source at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;beeper">https://github.com/beeper</a>)</p>

<p>Basically, if you are someone hacks on proprietary software and protocols for fun, we want to hire you. We don't care about your degree or previous work experience. We care about your ability break things to make them work the way you want.</p>

<p>Our bridges are written in Golang, but you don't need to know Golang to apply.</p>

<p>Automattic's products are used by over a billion people each month across WordPress.com, WooCommerce, WordPress VIP, Jetpack, Tumblr, Beeper, Day One, Pocket Casts, and many more. If you love the open web, open source, radical problem ownership, and simple over pure solutions, Automattic is probably the place for you.</p>
