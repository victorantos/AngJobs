<p>Elaborate - Software Engineer or Senior Software Engineer - Remote US - Full-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elaborate.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.elaborate.com</a></p>

<p>Elaborate is a clinical intelligence platform designed to reduce physician burnout. We streamline workflows for lab result management, clinician review, routing processing, and care coordination—freeing clinicians from time-consuming administrative work. The technical core of our products is our clinical engine, which can analyze a patient's chart and deterministically tell them what their lab results mean and what to do next.</p>

<p>I'm looking to hire people who have demonstrated success as an engineer for an early-stage startup and who are excited to tackle messy problems in the healthcare space by building safely but quickly. Full-stack fluency is preferred, but the bulk of our work consists of backend challenges–two-way EMR integrations, clinical data processing pipelines, etc. Leveling and compensation are flexible for the right candidate.</p>

<p>Tech stack buzzwords - Python, TypeScript, SQL, Postgres, Redis, NextJS, AWS, Docker, Terraform</p>
