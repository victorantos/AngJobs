<p>Sitch App - NYC-area - Full-time - Python + Flutter</p>

<p>Sitch is a new type of concierge dating app. We're using AI + Humans to ask you questions, get to know you, then help you find love. We're a concierge matchmaker but we don't call ourselves that and we don't charge the obscene prices that matchmakers charge.</p>

<p>One of our metrics is how little time you spend in the app. We're explicitly opposed to the dopamine-fueled mini-game doomswiping of 'traditional' dating apps which cynically monetizes desperation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We're top-tier VC funded, small team of 2 cofounders (Snap, Bumble) and 3 engineers, based in NYC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stack is Django, OpenAI, Flutter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking more for a backend engineer but if you're an all-arounder and can also work on client code (or want to learn) that would be ideal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 days/week in person, in Brooklyn, and the rest remote is our ideal working environment, so we're strongly preferring the NYC area.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
