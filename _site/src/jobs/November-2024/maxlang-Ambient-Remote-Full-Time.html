<p>Ambient - Remote - Full-Time - Blockchain Engineers, AI/ML Engineers/Researchers, Rust Developers</p>

<p>Ambient is developing a new blockchain with deep AI integration. We're implementing verified inference using a novel proof of work approach, ensuring the integrity of AI inference as different models respond uniquely to the same input.</p>

<p>Our long-term goal is to facilitate training and fine-tuning of models on the blockchain. We aim to provide an alternative to the current AI landscape dominated by a few large corporations, fostering a more transparent and inclusive approach to AI.</p>

<p>Looking for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blockchain Engineers (currently we're inspired by Solana, ideally you have rust experience)</li>
  <li>AI/ML Engineers/Researchers (especially if you've worked with distributed training)</li>
  <li>Rust Developers (especially if you have experience with large distributed systems)</li>
</ul>
