<p>Adronaline - Senior hardware engineer - Full-time - Ukraine or REMOTE</p>

<p>Smart ammunitions are held hostage by electronics vendors founded 100 years ago.
We are working on a G-hardened System-on-chip that can survive being fired from artillery and naval guns.</p>

<p>It's hard, challenging and you probably have no idea where to start but that's ok.
We'll figure it out.</p>

<p>We are particularly keen on people that have experience with continuous integration tools like renode.io or equivalent software test automation platforms (e.g. model-based design).</p>

<p>Co-founder level equity possible for the right person.</p>

<p>Hit me up at nicolas@adronaline.com if you're interested.</p>
