<p>Gravwell - Go developer - REMOTE (US) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gravwell.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.gravwell.io/</a></p>

<p>Gravwell is a Splunk competitor, a data aggregation and analysis platform that can ingest hundreds of terabytes a day with ease. Our product is offered both on-prem and as a hosted cloud service. It's written from the ground up in Go, with many open-source components.</p>

<p>We're looking for a skilled Go developer who's done more than just REST APIs (although that's <em>part</em> of the job). A well-qualified candidate should be deeply familiar with Linux at the syscall level, have some understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of various filesystems, and be well-versed in networking. If you know your way around /proc, if you've got horror stories about EBS performance, if you remember and mourn Go netchans, send us your resume. This is not an AI position, but experience in traditional machine learning and/or LLMs is a bonus.</p>

<p>The company is fully distributed, so don't worry about any RTO mandate â€“ we don't have an office. Travel for developers is minimal. Developers are periodically scheduled for second-tier on-call support.</p>
