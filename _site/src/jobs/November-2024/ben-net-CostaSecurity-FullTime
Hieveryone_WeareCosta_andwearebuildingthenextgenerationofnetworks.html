<p>Costa Security - Lead / Senior Engineer - Chicago / Bay Area Preference (Open to Remote) - Full Time
Hi everyone. We are Costa, and we are building the next generation of network security.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; who we are</p>

<p>At Costa, we believe in a world where it is easy to share information with good actors, and easy to protect it from bad ones. And we need help from great people to get there.</p>

<p>Our founding team has gone from garage to IPO before. We have experience at big companies (Amazon/Meta) and small. We are remote today, but have a preference for people near us (Bay Area/Chicago). We may not be fully remote in the future. We are early in our journey. We are backed by some great VCs. Now is an exciting time to join.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; what we do</p>

<p>We are building an infrastructure as code network security platform that runs everywhere. We help our customers easily move their compute between clouds, data centers, the edge by making networking and security understandable, repeatable and seamless.</p>

<p>Our first product gives network and security teams a single, seamless interface to deploy, configure and manage complex hybrid overlay networks and security services running within those networks.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; seeking great people</p>

<p>We are hiring our first product engineers. We are built on a modern stack: Ruby/Rails + StimulusJS, Golang, Kubernetes, Terraform, Packer and Wireguard. We are looking for backend, frontend and SRE/Devops engineers. Ideally people are familiar with networking and security concepts. Help build our engineering culture, one that embraces mutual respect, shared responsibility and continuous curiosity, and prizes an intellectual honesty that fosters both confidence and humility.</p>
