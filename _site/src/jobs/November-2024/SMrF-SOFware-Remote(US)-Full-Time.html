<p>SOFware - Remote (US) - Full-Time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sofwarellc.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://sofwarellc.com/</a></p>

<p>I am the Director of Product Engineering at SOFware. We are a fully remote, small and profitable software company founded by a retired Navy SEAL turned Ruby on Rails dev. We serve the most elite units in Special Operations and Law Enforcement communities. We have a SaaS product for Assessment and Selection and Talent Management, (e.g. software for the selectors who decide who gets to be an operator plus ongoing measurement of individual performance once selected). We also staff and run traditional butts-in-seats DoD contracts for a few government-owned apps that we created, run and maintain.</p>

<p>If you're an experienced Ruby on Rails developer interested in working on hard, important technical problems for special operations and other military units we'd love to talk. If you're not so experienced but have a background in any of these communities please reach out anyway!</p>

<p>We are currently hiring for one position for a senior Ruby on Rails dev, details are here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sofwarellc.com&#x2F;careers.html" rel="nofollow">https://sofwarellc.com/careers.html</a></p>

<p>If you have any questions I'm sean.fioritto at our domain.</p>
