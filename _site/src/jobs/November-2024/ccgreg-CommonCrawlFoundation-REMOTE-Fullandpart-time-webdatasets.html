<p>Common Crawl Foundation - REMOTE - Full and part-time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commoncrawl.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://commoncrawl.org/</a> - web datasets</p>

<p>I'm the CTO at the Common Crawl Foundation, which has a 17 year old, 9
petabyte crawl &amp; archive of the web. Our open dataset has been cited
in nearly 10,000 research papers, and is the most-used dataset in the
AWS Open Data program. Our organization is also very active in the
open source community.</p>

<p>We are expanding our engineering team. We're looking for people who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Excited about our non-profit, open data mission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proficient with Python, and hopefully also some Java</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proficient at cloud systems such as Spark/PySpark</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Willing to learn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our current team is composed of engineers who do some data science,
and data scientists who do some engineering. We are focused on
improving our crawl, making new data products, and using these new
data products to improve our crawl.</p>

<p>If you'd like a little tour of what our data looks like,
please see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;commoncrawl&#x2F;whirlwind-python&#x2F;">https://github.com/commoncrawl/whirlwind-python/</a></p>
