<p>AO Labs - Applied scientists/researchers &amp; various roles - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aolabs.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.aolabs.ai/</a> - Berkeley, CA + remote</p>

<p>AO Labs is building a more reliable alternative to deep learning and LLMs using continuously trainable, compute-efficient weightless neural networks. We are building AI that can learn after training.</p>

<p>We're a community of developers and researchers building general intelligence from the bottom-up and we are making space for collaborators at all levels –hackers, contributors, the curious (some of whom we’ve hired already). Get in touch: ali at aolabs.ai and I’ll share some demos.</p>

<p>With our framework we increase training efficiency and also combine the static pre-trained intelligence from LLMs with continuous training to learn local contexts. AI progress is bottlenecked by backpropagation, which necessitates a human in the loop to set the ground truth while also leaving a gap between training and inference that result in increasingly larger, more homogenizing models.</p>
