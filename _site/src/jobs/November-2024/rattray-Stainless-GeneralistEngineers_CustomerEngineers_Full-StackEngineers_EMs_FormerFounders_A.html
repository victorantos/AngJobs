<p>Stainless - Generalist Engineers, Customer Engineers, Full-Stack Engineers, EMs, Former Founders, Account Executives, more - NYC ONSITE - Full-time</p>

<p>Stainless is building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs. Our first product is SDKs as a service. I built the codegen system at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.</p>

<p>When you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install openai</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install anthropic</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go get …cloudflare</code>, for example, you’re downloading code that we generated.</p>

<p>Next, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right. We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.</p>

<p>We’re ~3y old, ~20 people, have strong revenue, several years of runway, and great customers (including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare). We’re backed by Sequoia.</p>

<p>As one of our first 20 engineers, you’ll get autonomy to build great products, skilled peers, opportunity for tremendous impact, and competitive salary, benefits, and equity.</p>

<p>We’re looking for exceptionally productive, thoughtful, tasteful, and kind people with a passion for making software development better for everyone.</p>
