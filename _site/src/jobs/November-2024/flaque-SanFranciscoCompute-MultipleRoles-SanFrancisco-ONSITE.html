<p>San Francisco Compute - Multiple Roles - San Francisco - ONSITE</p>

<p>We're building a new, regulated, commodity market for large scale GPU clusters. More like the Kalshi, less like craigslist. To accomplish this, we make a VM orchestrator called "Fog" that understands InfiniBand, GPUs, and heterogeneous hardware setups.</p>

<p>We make money by taking a flat fee of a few cents per GPU hour upon delivery. Up until recently, we've been "running a market" via a spreadsheet, by selling bursts on very large clusters (think 6 to 8 figures deal sizes).</p>

<p>SFC started because Alex (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alexgajewski.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://alexgajewski.org/</a>) &amp; I went to go train an audio model and none of the vendors at the time would sell us a month-long contract. So we bought a year-long one, and tried to sublease it at cost (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36933603">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36933603</a>), so that way we could buy just one month.</p>

<p>The goal of the company is the same: we want to make it possible to buy a big, giant training cluster for a short time period. We think a liquid market will let you spend $40m for a month instead of $300m for a year. If we can't make that happen, then only the big labs will get to make AI.</p>

<p>Most of our code is in rust, some typescript. We're about ~20 people. We raised $12m a bit ago. There are 7 ex-founders on the team.</p>

<p>We'd love to work with you! I'll bet you're cool.</p>
