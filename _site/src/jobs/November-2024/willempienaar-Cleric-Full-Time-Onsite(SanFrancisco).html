<p>Cleric - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleric.io" rel="nofollow">https://cleric.io</a> - Software Engineers, Platform &amp; Product - Full-Time - Onsite (San Francisco)</p>

<p>Cleric is an AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) that diagnoses production issues at machine speed, using the same tools engineers use today. We're live in production at major enterprises and backed by leading AI infrastructure investors.</p>

<p>Our vision is to free engineers from operational toil entirely. Production systems have become too complex and fast-moving for human operators - we're building Cleric to handle this complexity autonomously, letting engineers focus on building products.</p>

<p>Roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Software Engineer, Product: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;Cleric&#x2F;131dd323-6d76-4d79-9cc5-f3b5cc85e39e">https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Cleric/131dd323-6d76-4d79-9cc5-f3b5…</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Software Engineer, Platform: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.ashbyhq.com&#x2F;Cleric&#x2F;bf48c037-56dc-4237-bfe3-fe0c779bd66d">https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Cleric/bf48c037-56dc-4237-bfe3-fe0c…</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We're looking for builders who want to create a future where AI handles operations and engineers can get back to building. You'll join a team of veteran AI and infrastructure builders working closely out of our San Francisco office.</p>
