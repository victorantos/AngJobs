<p>Phrasing - CTO (Elixir + ClojureScript + ML) - Remote (Europe) - Full-time</p>

<p>Hi there  Ben and Niko here, founders of Phrasing, an application that can actually help you learn a new language. We're an engineering &amp; design duo looking for another technical person to join the project.</p>

<p>To be honest, we've been working on the project for many months now, and somehow continuously wake up every day more excited than the last. Phrasing seems to land in the sweet spot between a market ripe for innovation, an innovative technology catering directly to that market, and an awesome product area to work in.</p>

<p>We've got a working product, paying users, and unlimited potential.</p>

<p>To us, working on Phrasing is the dream. So naturally, there must be other people out there who would feel the same.</p>

<p>As we scale from our initial users to our initial millions, we're looking for a technical person to join in a co-founding capacity.</p>

<p>We can't offer you a competitive salary (yet), and it's too early in the company to be able to promise any semblance of a work life balance.</p>

<p>But if you consider yourself an engineering maverick, have a passion for languages, and a penchant for building - then find out more at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasing.app&#x2F;dream-team" rel="nofollow">https://phrasing.app/dream-team</a></p>

<p>Backend: Elixir, Phoenix, Broadway, FLAME, Nx, Scholar
Frontend: ClojureScript, Reagent, Local-First, RTC, Single Page Application, Sync Engine
Persistence: Postgres. All the things.</p>
