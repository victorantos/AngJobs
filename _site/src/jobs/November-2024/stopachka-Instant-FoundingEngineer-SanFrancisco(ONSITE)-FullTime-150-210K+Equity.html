<p>Instant - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instantdb.com">https://instantdb.com</a> - Founding Engineer - San Francisco (ONSITE) - Full Time - 150-210K + Equity</p>

<p>We're building Instant - a modern Firebase. Instant gives you a database you can subscribe to directly in the browser. You write relational queries in the shape of the data you want and we handle all the data fetching, reactivity, permission checking, offline caching, and optimistic updates.</p>

<p>Some context on us:</p>

<p>In August we open sourced Instant and had one of the largest Show HN’s for a YC company. We just announced a $3.4M seed and are backed by James Tamplin (CEO of Firebase), Paul Graham, Karri Saarinen, Greg Brockman, Jeff Dean, Amjad Masad and a bunch more technical angels.</p>

<p>We're currently a team of 3, working in-person in our office in SOMA. Our backend is in clojure and our frontend is typescript. We all do a bit of everything :)</p>

<p>We're looking to grow our team to 5. If you're the kind of hacker who who takes their craft and their word seriously, who moves fast, and isn’t afraid to look into the ‘scarier’ parts of programming, we want to talk to you</p>

<p>Want to apply?</p>

<p>Send us an email at founders [at] instantdb.com . Please include a side-project you've worked on (if it comes with a GitHub, heeck yeah!).</p>
