<p>Amazon - Full-time - Security Engineering/Management - Austin, TX - On-Site</p>

<p>I am hiring a new Application Security team in Austin to focus on making the highest-privilege applications in the non-AWS side of the company the planet's most secure.</p>

<p>This team will be joining a 9-month old effort to collaborate with developers of key apps on security assessment, architecture improvement, design and code review, and automation of the security process.</p>

<p>The pros of our team are technical excellence, a culture of sustainable work (we are working hard here, but strictly 9-5), the opportunity to have a significant influence on the security posture of the company as a whole, and the chance to hack on applications operating at a global scale, and low (1x/month) oncall expectations.</p>

<p>The cons of our team are moderate process debt (arising from our newness and some unexpected demand)and higher-than-normal ambiguity in tasks (we hold too many task definitions/bars in our head and haven't written them down yet).</p>

<p>Please apply to these roles through the links below:</p>
