<p>MONUMENTAL - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monumental.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https://www.monumental.co/</a> - Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Full Time - Onsite</p>

<p>We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, and we’re starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.</p>

<p>We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a software stack that lets us configure and control robots with ease. We’re deploying our robots on real construction sites and have started making the first revenue from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.</p>

<p>The software team is now ten people. The team is approaching 40 in total (and growing quickly!) There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building, and we’re scaling up robot production to meet it.</p>

<p>Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.</p>

<p>This month we have started hiring for a new role: Forward Deployed Robotics Engineer (also open to interns). We are looking for people can bridge the gap between software engineering and the construction site: operating the robot; spotting opportunities to build faster and better; and rapidly hacking them into existence.</p>

<p>My colleague has written a blog post[1] about his experience in this role - give it a read if you're interested.</p>
