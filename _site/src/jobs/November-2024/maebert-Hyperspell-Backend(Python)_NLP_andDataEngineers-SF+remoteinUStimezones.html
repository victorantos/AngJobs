<p>Hyperspell - Backend (Python), NLP, and Data Engineers - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyperspell.com" rel="nofollow">https://hyperspell.com</a> - SF + remote in US timezones</p>

<p>Hyperspell is building RAG-as-a-service, allowing developers to build AI apps in minutes, not months — think Plaid for unstructured data. There are many great products for people who want to build their own RAG pipeline. Hyperspell is there for those who don’t.</p>

<p>We have built machine learning &amp; NLP products since way before it was cool. You will join as on of our first engineers working on a technically complex product with many moving parts and lots of things to figure out. That’s okay, because you’re an excellent figurer-outer. In fact, that’s what you’re world class at (at least) two things: you like figuring things out.</p>
