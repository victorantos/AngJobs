<p>Stanford Research Computing - Stanford, CA (next to Palo Alto) - Full-time - Four positions - HYBRID/ONSITE</p>

<p>Stanford Research Computing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcc.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">https://srcc.stanford.edu</a>) is a collaboration between University IT and the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. We operate HPC environments for researchers, we do one-time consultations on projects (from software and pipelines, to data management, to physical building design and fit-out), and we provide contract support for individual Labs, Departments, and Schools.</p>

<p>We have three open positions:</p>

<p>• Research Computing Manager: Our current IC:Manager ratio is 7, which is too high, so we're hiring another manager for our group! You'll oversee a number of ICs, help them plan &amp; prioritize their work, make policy decisions, and contribute to Research Computing's strategic direction. You'll also be interacting with groups throughout the University, as a service provider and as a policy maker.

<p>• Research Storage Consultant: We have lots of storage environments (both on-prem &amp; cloud); it can be confusing to identify which is the best for a given purpose, and how to take full advantage of it. Your job will be to help Students &amp; Faculty figure out what storage is best to use, and get them started on using it!

<p>(For those curious: Yes, we did hire a Data Center Engineer recently, but this posting is different: One of our existing Engineers was prompted to Data Center Director, causing a new Engineer position to open up!)</p>

<p>The data center position is onsite; the others are hybrid. If you don't already live in the Bay Area, we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don't commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you're on-site (except at the data center). There is some on-call around the holidays. We get a 403(b) match, good healthcare, and 30+ days off per year (holidays + vacation). All Benefits are all publicly documented at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cardinalatwork.stanford.edu&#x2F;benefits-rewards" rel="nofollow">https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards</a>.
