<p>Kulipa - Backend Engineer - London - ONSITE</p>

<p>We issue Visa &amp; Mastercard cards not backed by a bank. Instead we use stablecoins held in non custodial wallets.</p>

<p>This type of service is crucial for many people in places like Argentina, Colombia, Nigeria, Turkey, where inflation soars and sheltering in foreign currency is hard and often impossible.</p>

<p>Down the line, we want to take card payment settlement time down from days to minutes, which will remove a huge and expensive inefficiency in the card scheme.</p>

<p>We are headed by an ex-Mastercard, Google, Meta, and Binance team. Still very small: 5 people on the engineering team. We intend to continue growing small and senior. Our current team is skewed heavily towards senior with two former L7s from Meta/Google.</p>

<p>We have raised a seed early this year and are seconds from going live with first cards.</p>

<p>Looking for senior, passionate engineers in London.
