<p>OCCRP - Senior Frontend Developer - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.occrp.org" rel="nofollow">https://www.occrp.org</a> - Full Time - REMOTE (UTC +0 to +4)</p>

<p>We're working on a new implementation of Aleph<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aleph.occrp.org&#x2F;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aleph.occrp.org&#x2F;&lt;/a">1</a>, a tool to index and link research material for investigative journalism. The goal is to give investigative journalists an effective and user-friendly "big data" type tool to deal with mountains of documents.</p>

<p>Part of that is building a new frontend from the ground up, first to improve the existing features, and then to develop new features.</p>

<p>We're not looking for a specific tech stack, but rather the right person to build a good foundation. You can "bring your own tech stack" – anything reasonably mainstream-y is fine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Should have reasonable experience with the core of the selected tech stack. This is a small team with some deadlines, without a lot of room for experimentation with the latest greatest JavaScript thingy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want "boring tech"<a href="a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?t=ffab&amp;q=boring+tech&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?t=ffab&amp;q=boring+tech&lt;/a">2</a> that will still work in five years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reasonable dependency tree; in the dozens, not hundreds and certainly not thousands. It's not a crime to write 50 lines of code yourself if that saves adding a whole bunch of dependencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good developer experience: changes should show up in hundreds of milliseconds, not seconds. Any competent developer should be able to start working on it with a relatively short lead time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The initial focus will mainly be on re-implementing the existing frontend, after which the focus will shift to new features.</p>

<p>You will be working with a UX designer and we're not looking for a UX expert, but you should have familiarity with good UX design. You will be joining a team of three backend developers, a UX design researcher, and a product manager. Everyone works fully remote.</p>

<p>While this is primarily a frontend position, willingness to learn at least some Go basics would be good (it's okay if you don't know Go).</p>

<p>HOW TO APPLY</p>

<p>Please email martin.tournoij@occrp.org with a resume and a brief description of your proposed tech stack and why you think it meets the requirements. This doesn't need to be very detailed – 2 to 4 paragraphs is enough. As mentioned, pretty much $any tech stack is fine – we're fairly open about this. Please <em>do</em> write this.</p>

<p>I'll respond to everyone. Turn-around time should be about ~2 weeks at the most.</p>
