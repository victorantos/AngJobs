<p>IP Copilot - Full-Stack Engineer - Full-Time - Remote (US) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipcopilot.ai" rel="nofollow">https://ipcopilot.ai</a></p>

<p>IP Copilot is an AI platform that discovers &amp; tracks innovations within companies in real-time. We integrate into slack, Jira, Google 
 Workspace, etc. and notify companies when we find something patentable. Then helps law firms, research labs, universities, enterprises, etc. protect their intellectual property by assisting them through the patent process.</p>

<p>Clients interact through our Ruby on Rails for the full-stack framework and our backend is written in python, utilizing AWS for infrastructure. We host all of our own LLMs and ML systems and the team is a seasoned group of AI applied researchers and open source contributors - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipcopilot.ai&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https://ipcopilot.ai/about</a></p>

<p>We just closed our seed round led by a fortune 100 company and have a close nit team of 6 looking to grow the team to 10 within the next 3 months. We're an early stage startup so you'll be expected to work on all aspects of the product and be fast to adapt. That said, we have a very experienced team, with years of experience, 1000+ patents, academic papers with experience launching enterprise products and managing large open source projects.</p>

<p>We're looking for a junior to mid-level full-stack engineer to assist us in building out the ruby on rails application.</p>
