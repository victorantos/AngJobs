<p>Elaborate is a clinical intelligence platform designed to reduce physician burnout by automating inbasket tasks. We streamline workflows for lab result management, clinician review, routing processing, and care coordination—freeing clinicians from time-consuming administrative work.</p>

<p>I'm looking to hire someone who has demonstrated success as an engineer for an early-stage startup and who is excited to tackle messy problems in the healthcare space by building safely but quickly. Full-stack fluency is preferred, but the bulk of our work consists of backend challenges–two-way EMR integrations, clinical data processing pipelines, etc.</p>

<p>Tech stack buzzwords - Python, TypeScript, SQL, Postgres, Redis, NextJS, AWS, Docker, Terraform</p>
