<p>San Francisco, CA; full-time; onsite/in-person</p>

<p>I’m the cofounder of KREA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krea.ai" rel="nofollow">https://krea.ai</a>), a startup in San Francisco building a design tool to make AI fast, controllable, and intuitive. We’re a small team (~7) and we’re looking for talented folks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.krea.ai&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https://www.krea.ai/careers</a>) who are interested in scuffling hard technical problems with other smart people while building a useful, beautiful, and performant product that millions of creatives globally will rely upon.</p>

<p>Check out our SIGGRAPH talk (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Gm1B5DT8kE0?t=5824" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/Gm1B5DT8kE0?t=5824</a>) or how our users use KREA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MartinNebelong&#x2F;status&#x2F;1724747362327781502" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/MartinNebelong/status/1724747362327781502</a>) to see some features of the product.</p>

<p>We are well-funded, have millions in both users and revenue, and we keep growing. Our userbase ranges from the creative director of Coldplay to people doing 3D renders for architecture firms.</p>

<p>However, everything is on fire, and our small team can't build fast enough alone. We are looking for any smart person fascinated by our industry.</p>

<p>Example tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Frontend: building out 3D environments for AI rendering, highly detailed optimization work on our real-time AI canvas, and tons of Svelte (compiler knowledge is a great bonus!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Machine-learning: work on adapters from MMDit blocks to make models like Flux or SD3.5 more steerable; apply SAEs to cluster and interpret large image/video datasets; implement Diffusion-DPO; work on large-scale training and inference optimization for image/video diffusion models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Backend: build, scale, and "reliabilize" an infrastructure to support a cluster of &gt;1000 GPU-nodes performantly, simply, and beautifully. We expect excellent understanding of distributed systems and engineering trade-offs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our tech stack: PyTorch, CUDA, DeepSpeed, k8s, ONNX, TensorRT, Grafana, Svelte(Kit), PostgreSQL, Redis.</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more about what we’re working on or just want to meet to talk about steerable AI for creatives, you can email me at d+hn@krea.ai.</p>
