<p>Ply Health (YC S24) - Founding Engineer, Product - Full-time - NYC - $120K-$180K + equity - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.plyhealth.com&#x2F;">https://www.plyhealth.com/</a></p>

<p>We use AI to help healthcare providers enroll with insurance networks so they can start billing. We've been growing quickly and are almost at the point of turning away customers because we don't have enough engineering capacity to service them. We're looking for our second engineer who will focus on customer-facing product features to help wrangle the frustrating and complex world of healthcare administration.</p>

<p>This person will have a hand in all of our core systems, interact closely with our customers and their pain points, and work with an ex-FAANG, ex-YC engineering team.</p>

<p>This role is on-site only in NYC.</p>
