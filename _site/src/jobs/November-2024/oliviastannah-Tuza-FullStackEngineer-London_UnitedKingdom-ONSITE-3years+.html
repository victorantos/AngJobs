<p>Tuza - Full Stack Engineer - London, United Kingdom - ONSITE - &gt;= 80k+ - 3 years+</p>

<p>At Tuza, we've raised $7m from leading investors to build the exchange for payments. Our pricing platform enables the world's largest banks to generate real-time rates for payments by instantly pricing risk.</p>

<p>Since launch, merchants using Tuza have taken over £3bn in card payments. We work with some of the largest payment providers in the UK (Worldpay, Barclaycard, Revolut) and price comparison sites (uSwitch, Money.co.uk). Our product pipeline includes our risk-based pricing technology, our price comparison technology and our own card terminal, which will launch in Q4 2024.</p>

<p>We're on an exciting upward trajectory and need more hands to help us sustain the growth. Our approach to engineering is different from most companies—it's more product-focused and experimental, and everyone works in responsible and autonomous teams. Critically, everyone is intelligent and kind and gets involved end-to-end, from customer feedback to ideation to shaping to building to measuring.</p>
